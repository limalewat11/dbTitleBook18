<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>At Home in the Universe: The Search for the Laws of Self-Organization and Complexity</h2><p>A major scientific revolution has begun, a new paradigm that rivals Darwin's theory in importance. At its heart is the discovery of the order that lies deep within the most complex of systems, from the origin of life, to the workings of giant corporations, to the rise and fall of great civilizations. And more than anyone else, this revolution is the work of one man, Stuart Kauffman, a MacArthur Fellow and visionary pioneer of the new science of complexity. Now, in <em>At Home in the Universe</em>, Kauffman brilliantly weaves together the excitement of intellectual discovery and a fertile mix of insights to give the general reader a fascinating look at this new science--and at the forces for order that lie at the edge of chaos.<br> We all know of instances of spontaneous order in nature--an oil droplet in water forms a sphere, snowflakes have a six-fold symmetry. What we are only now discovering, Kauffman says, is that the range of spontaneous order is enormously greater than we had supposed. Indeed, self-organization is a great undiscovered principle of nature. But how does this spontaneous order arise? Kauffman contends that complexity itself triggers self-organization, or what he calls "order for free," that if enough different molecules pass a certain threshold of complexity, they begin to self-organize into a new entity--a living cell. Kauffman uses the analogy of a thousand buttons on a rug--join two buttons randomly with thread, then another two, and so on. At first, you have isolated pairs; later, small clusters; but suddenly at around the 500th repetition, a remarkable transformation occurs--much like the phase transition when water abruptly turns to ice--and the buttons link up in one giant network. Likewise, life may have originated when the mix of different molecules in the primordial soup passed a certain level of complexity and self-organized into living entities (if so, then life is not a highly improbable chance event, but almost inevitable). Kauffman uses the basic insight of "order for free" to illuminate a staggering range of phenomena. We see how a single-celled embryo can grow to a highly complex organism with over two hundred different cell types. We learn how the science of complexity extends Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection: that self-organization, selection, and chance are the engines of the biosphere. And we gain insights into biotechnology, the stunning magic of the new frontier of genetic engineering--generating trillions of novel molecules to find new drugs, vaccines, enzymes, biosensors, and more. Indeed, Kauffman shows that ecosystems, economic systems, and even cultural systems may all evolve according to similar general laws, that tissues and terra cotta evolve in similar ways. And finally, there is a profoundly spiritual element to Kauffman's thought. If, as he argues, life were bound to arise, not as an incalculably improbable accident, but as an expected fulfillment of the natural order, then we truly are at home in the universe.<br> Kauffman's earlier volume, <em>The Origins of Order</em>, written for specialists, received lavish praise. Stephen Jay Gould called it "a landmark and a classic." And Nobel Laureate Philip Anderson wrote that "there are few people in this world who ever ask the right questions of science, and they are the ones who affect its future most profoundly. Stuart Kauffman is one of these." In <em>At Home in the Universe</em>, this visionary thinker takes you along as he explores new insights into the nature of life.</p><p>The best treatment I have yet encountered about how order emerges naturally -- and possibly even necessarily -- out of chaos. Profoundly important, and considerably more informed than better-known pop-science treatments of chaos theory. Very highly recommended.<br><strong>Stuart Kauffman</strong> is a member of the Santa Fe Institute. A MacArthur fellowship recipient, he is the leading thinker on self-organization and the science of complexity as applied to biology.<br></p><h2>JUST LIKE JESUS</h2><p><p>God loves you just the way you are, but he refuses to leave you there. He wants you to be just like Jesus.</p><p>Can you think of a better offer?</p><p>Jesus felt no guilt; God wants you to feel no guilt. Jesus had no bad habits; God wants to do away with yours. Jesus had no fears; God wants the same for you. Jesus had no anxiety about death; you neednt either. Gods desire, his plan, his ultimate goal is to make you into the image of Christ.</p><p>But how does this change occur? And why does the change seem so slow? If God wants me to be just like Jesus, why do I still seem just like me?</p><p>In <i>Just Like Jesus</i>, Max Lucado helps you answer these questions. He helps you understand Gods wonderful ways of transformation. Would you like to know more? Then read on. And remember: <i>God loves you just way you are, but he refuses to leave you there. He wants you to be just like Jesus.</i></p></p><p><i>"What if for 24 hours Jesus wakes up in your bed, walks in your shoes, lives in your house, assumes your schedule?... What if for one day Jesus lives your life with his heart?</i><p> Within these opening lines lies the premise of Max Lucado's book about the possibility of becoming "just like Jesus." In recounting the biblical stories of Jesus' life and deeds, Lucado then explains how Jesus' acts of compassion, forgiveness, honesty, and faith can be reflected in anyone's everyday life. Lucado's concrete analogy of "just like Jesus" helps many readers grasp the fundamentals of Christianity in a new and inspiring way. Furthermore, in taking on the values, heart and deeds of Jesus, Lucado believes, Christians can expect a richer, more accessible relationship with God. "Jesus had unbroken communion with his father," writes Lucado. "Do you suppose the Father desires the same for us? Absolutely ... God has the same abiding intimacy with you that he had with his son."</p><p> One of the reasons that Lucado's popularity has soared is that he combines straightforward storytelling skills with simple, unfettered theology to explain how Christianity influences modern life, from marriage and career to golf games and traffic jams. Fans will also appreciate his companion study guide at the end of the book, which offers provocative questions relating to the themes of each chapter. <i>--Gail Hudson</i></p><b>Max Lucado</b>, minister for the Oak Hills Church in San Antonio, Texas, is the husband of Denalyn and father of Jenna, Andrea, and Sara.

This long-awaited revision contains changes throughout the text.<br> <br> There are new implementations of most of the major programming systems in the book, including the interpreters and compilers, and the authors have incorporated many small changes that reflect their experience teaching the course at MIT since the first edition was published.<br> <br> A new theme has been introduced that emphasizes the central role played by different approaches to dealing with time in computational models: objects with state, concurrent programming, functional programming and lazy evaluation, and nondeterministic programming. There are new example sections on higher-order procedures in graphics and on applications of stream processing in numerical programming, and many new exercises.<br> <br> In addition, all the programs have been reworked to run in any Scheme implementation that adheres to the IEEE standard.</p><p>Abelson and Sussman's classic <i>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</i> teaches readers how to program by employing the tools of abstraction and modularity. The authors' central philosophy is that programming is the task of breaking large problems into small ones. The book spends a great deal of time considering both this decomposition and the process of knitting the smaller pieces back together.<p> The authors employ this philosophy in their writing technique. The text asks the broad question "What is programming?" Having come to the conclusion that programming consists of procedures and data, the authors set off to explore the related questions of "What is data?" and "What is a procedure?"</p><p> The authors build up the simple notion of a procedure to dizzying complexity. The discussion culminates in the description of the code behind the programming language Scheme. The authors finish with examples of how to implement some of the book's concepts on a register machine. Through this journey, the reader not only learns how to program, but also how to think about programming.</p>Hal Abelson is Class of 1922 Professor of Computer Science and Engineering at Massachusetts Institute of Technology and a fellow of the IEEE. He is a founding director of Creative Commons, Public Knowledge, and the Free Software Foundation. Additionally, he serves as co-chair for the MIT Council on Educational Technology.</p><h2>Financial &amp; Managerial Accounting</h2><p>Gain a solid foundation in the core accounting concepts as you develop a true appreciation for why accounting is important to business and a prosperous society with Warren/Reeve/Duchac&#39;s FINANCIAL AND MANAGERIAL ACCOUNTING, 14E.

This book has been written to prepare both, through personal development to help them all understand HRM in order to optimize the benefit that derives from it. And to make the subject engaging while developing long-lasting impact, we focus on developing both skill andknowledge so students learn how to take action in addition to learning about HRM. By helping to successfully acquire, deploy, and motivate the right talent, HRM is critical to every manager s and organization s success. The central theme of our book is helping you understand how to use HRM to hire, develop, motivate, and retain the right people and bring out the best in employees to execute the company s business strategy and secure a competitive advantage. Our book is intended for those who are or who might become a manager or an HRM professional. We discuss the roles of HRM professionals, managers, and employees in the design and implementation of effective HRM systems, and include many current examples of how HRM is executed in organizations. Because there is rarely a single best way to implement HRM, every chapter has an HR Flexiblity feature that highlights how HR needs to be flexible to best meet the needs of different situations. The Global Issues feature in each chapter discusses how HRM practices differ around the world and how HRM needs to be adapted to best meet the demands of different global and cultural contexts. Each chapter s Develop Your Skills feature focuses on improving a specific skill related to that chapter s topic. By developing your competence and confidence in using important HRM skills, this book will help you become a more effective manager through the better use of HRM tools and practices. The importance of the context of HRM, including laws, ethics, and globalization, is woven throughout the book. How organizations are using various technologies to improve and facilitate the execution of HRM is also described. Each chapter opens with a Real World Challenge, describing an actual HRM situation faced by a company or manager to highlight the business importance of the chapter s topic and to prompt reflective reading. The chapters conclude with the Real World Response, which describes how the organization or manager handled the situation to show how the chapter concepts were applied. In addition to the case study contained in each chapter, the Real World Challenge is designed to improve analytical and problem-solving skills. We wrote this book to be very experiential and to cultivate skill development. Rather than just learning about HRM, we also want you to become better at HRM. Developing your HRM skills will make you a more effective manager and will make your job easier no matter what field you are in. A book-long integrated project, case studies, videos, and numerous exercises develop readers personal skills and provide some experience in applying various HR concepts. The Happy Time Toys videos written and filmed exclusively for this book reinforce the relevance of the textbook material and enhance decision-making, analytical, and HRM skills. We wrote the book to be engaging to read. We include many practical examples, and focus on teaching HRM as it is done today. We also provide many opportunities to develop your HRM-related skills, and we hope that you find these activities to be both developmental and enjoyable.

Brian Garfield, a novelist and screenwriter whose works have sold some 20 million copies, was searching for a new subject when he came upon the story of this "forgotten war" in Alaska. He found the history of the brave men who had served in the Aleutians so compelling and so little known that he wrote the first full-length history of the Aleutian campaign, and the book remains a favorite among Alaskans.<br>The war in the Aleutians was fought in some of the worst climatic conditions on earth for men, ships, and airplanes. The sea was rough, the islands craggy and unwelcoming, and enemy number one was always the weather--the savage wind, fog, and rain of the Aleutian chain. The fog seemed to reach even into the minds of the military commanders on both sides, as they directed men into situations that so often had tragic results. Frustrating, befuddling, and still the subject of debate, the Aleutian campaign nevertheless marked an important turn of the war in favor of the United States.<br>Now, half a century after the war ended, more of the fog has been lifted. In the updated University of Alaska Press edition, Garfield supplements his original account, which was drawn from statistics, personal interviews, letters, and diaries, with more recently declassified photographs and many more illustrations.</p><p>Students of World War II history will delight to find an exclusive focus on how the battles were fought in Alaska and the Aleutians: something commonly overlooked in favor of the more graphic and active European and Pacific arenas. This first appeared in 1969: it remains one of the best accounts of the war, reading like fiction and including fine documentary records in this reprint. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Practical Guide To Autism</h2><p>Autism is in the public spotlight now more than ever as new research and information appears almost daily. Although in many ways this is a positive development it also presents challenges to families and practitioners who want to keep up with the latest developments and are left to sift through new information by themselves to see what is credible and relevant for them.Each of us needs a personal research assistant who can determine which information we need to pay attention to and let us know how it might affect our daily work and the children we are living with or serve. <p>Since we each don&#x2019;t have our own research assistants on staff, I am delighted to recommend this wonderful book by Fred Volkmar and Lisa Wiesner. Both of these talented professional leaders have combined their scientific skills and understanding of the field with great practical experience and ideas about how research can be translated into clinical practice. The result is a book that provides the best and most comprehensive information about recent scientific developments and a splendid practical guide for how they are being implemented and what we are learning in the process. The issues are presented in all of their complexity but translated into language that is clear, direct, and easy to follow. The format also lends itself to understanding the complex issues and their implications through excellent charts, question and answer sections, and chapters that vary from describing diagnostic issues to stating very specifically how to expand and evaluate the services one is receiving. The comprehensive references and lists of additional resources also add greatly to the overall package.</p> <p>As a professional dedicated to understanding scientific advances and helping families and teachers to utilize them most effectively, I am very pleased to have an ally like this book available. I am very grateful to the authors for providing a very credible, practical, and relevant addition to our field to help the many advocates and family practitioners to better understand the exciting new developments and how they can be implemented in our day to day work. Those taking the time to read through this superb volume will find it time well spent that pays back dividends in many different ways.<br> <b>&#x2014;FOREWORD by Gary B.

The impressive photographs of works from all visual arts movements are at the center of these richly illustrated volumes. The books successfully provide an overview of the artistic diversity of the individual periods, and they couldn&#39;t have been written and illustrated any more clearly. The informative and interesting texts have been written by renowned authors from the fields of history, architecture and art history, providing a multifaceted view of each period. These books are a real pleasure for anyone with an interest in art.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: GermanHere is a wonderful book that both inspires and educates. A huge volume covering the Gothic movement in art from the 12th century to the Renaissance, it focuses largely on the development of Gothic architecture, resplendent in well-placed illustrations and photographs that evoke the grandeur of the period. Smaller sections follow on sculpture, painting, stained glass, and gold work. The text is clear and organized, with each chapter authored by German writers and art experts; the translation from German may account for some small editorial errors. Michael Camille's Gothic Art: Glorious Visions (LJ 11/1/96) is perhaps a more general, popular introduction to the topic, but this book is a major text on Gothic art. Highly recommended for academic libraries and larger public libraries.AKaren Ellis, Baldwin Boettcher Lib., Humble, TX <br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Scientific American: Psychology</h2><p>Combining written profiles with video interviews of real people, <em>Scientific American: Psychology</em> improves comprehension, retention, and your ability torelate to psychology&#x2019;s basic ideas. <br><p></p><br><p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><b>Deborah Licht</b> is a professor of psychology at Pikes Peak Community College in Colorado Springs, Colorado.

Part survey of modern physics, part exploration of the philosophy of mind, the book is not for casual readers--though it's not overly technical, it rarely pauses to let the reader catch a breath. The overview of relativity and quantum theory, written by a master, is priceless and uncontroversial. The exploration of consciousness and AI, though, is generally considered as resting on shakier ground.<p> Penrose claims that there is an intimate, perhaps unknowable relation between quantum effects and our thinking, and ultimately derives his anti-AI stance from his proposition that some, if not all, of our thinking is non-algorithmic. Of course, these days we believe that there are other avenues to AI than traditional algorithmic programming; while he has been accused of setting up straw robots to knock down, this accusation is unfair. Little was then known about the power of neural networks and behavior-based robotics to simulate (and, some would say, <i>produce</i>) intelligent problem-solving behavior. Whether these tools will lead to strong AI is ultimately a question of belief, not proof, and <i>The Emperor's New Mind</i> offers powerful arguments useful to believer and nonbeliever alike. <i>--Rob Lightner</i></p>Roger Penrose is the Rouse Ball Professor of Mathematics at the University of Oxford.

Thousands of women were raped, at least one million people were killed, and ten to fifteen million were forced to leave their homes as refugees. One of the first events of decolonization in the twentieth century, Partition was also one of the most bloody. In this book Yasmin Khan examines the context, execution, and aftermath of Partition, weaving together local politics and ordinary lives with the larger political forces at play. She exposes the widespread obliviousness to what Partition would entail in practice and how it would affect the populace.&nbsp;Drawing together fresh information from an array of sources, Khan underscores the catastrophic human cost and shows why the repercussions of Partition resound even now, some sixty years later. The book is an intelligent and timely analysis of Partition, the haste and recklessness with which it was completed, and the damaging legacy left in its wake.</p></p><p><p>One of the first events of decolonization in the twentieth century, the Great Partition of 1947 was also one of the most bloody.

Drawing on his rich experience and intimate familiarity with the works of these giants, Charles Rosen presents his keen insights in clear and persuasive language.</p><p>Written in 1970, this winner of the National Book Award is perhaps the best guide to the music of the late 18th century that the reader is likely to find. Rosen defines classical music (which, in this case, is probably more properly rendered "Classical," as it refers to that specific style) through the music of its greatest geniuses: Mozart, Haydn and Beethoven. This is serious stuff, but well worth the effort for the student of classical music. There are many printed musical illustrations; you'll get more out of this book if you read music. This volume has a logical successor in Rosen's <b>The Romantic Generation</b>. A revised version in hardcover is due later this year.Charles Rosen, professor of music and social thought at the University of Chicago, has also taught at the State University of New York-Stony Brook and delivered the Charles Eliot Norton Lectures at Harvard University. His recitals and other performances have won the highest critical acclaim, as have his books, The Classical Style and The Romantic Generation.

Its great themes, epochal events and towering figures set down vectors on which the biblical story is played out. The very shape of the rest of the Old Testament would collapse were the Penteteuch to be removed. The structure of New Testament thought would be barely intelligible without it. Here we meet the great ancestral figures of Israel--Abraham, Isaac and Jacob--and the towering figure of Moses, whose presence dominates four of these five books. The creative act of God, the paradisal garden, the exile of Adam and Eve, the judgment of the great flood, the call of Abraham from among the nations, the covenant of Abraham, the exodus from Egypt, the giving of the law at Sinai, the plan of the tabernacle, the varied experiences of Israel in the wilderness, and the announcement of the covenant blessings and curses--all of these and more contribute to a work of world-formative power. This dictionary explores the major themes and contours of the Pentateuch. Behind and beneath the grandeur of the Pentateuch, issues of historicity have both puzzled and beckoned. But whereas in the mid-twentieth century many English-speaking scholars were confident of archaeological support for the patriarchal accounts, the climate has now changed. In the most extreme cases, some contemporary scholars have radically challenged the antiquity of the ancestral stories, arguing for their final composition even as late as the Hellenistic era. This dictionary examines and weighs the historical issues and poses possible solutions. The documentary hypothesis, the former reigning critical consensus, is now widely rumored to be on life support with no heir apparent. Meanwhile, conservative scholars reconsider what indeed a claim to Mosaic authorship should entail. This dictionary offers an assessment of the array of questions surrounding these issues and considers some possible ways forward for evangelical scholarship. At the same time, there has been a fruitful turning to the nature, message and art of the received text of the Pentateuch. Literary studies of brief episodes, sprawling sagas, complex narrative and even the fivefold composition of the Pentateuch itself have delivered promising and exciting results. This dictionary offers both appreciative panoramas and close-up assessments of these developments and their methods. The <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch</em> is the first in a four-volume series covering the text of the Old Testament. Following in the tradition of the four award-winning IVP dictionaries focused on the New Testament and its background, this encyclopedic work is characterized by close attention to the text of the Old Testament and the ongoing conversation of contemporary scholarship. In exploring the major themes and issues of the Pentateuch, editors T. Desmond Alexander and David W.Baker, with an international and expert group of scholars, inform and challenge through authoritative overviews, detailed examinations and new insights from the world of the ancient Near East. The <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch</em> is designed to be your first stop in the study and research of the Pentateuch, on which the rest of the Bible is built.</p><p>Baker (A.B., M.C.S., M.Phil., Ph.D.) is professor of Old Testament and Semitic languages at Ashland Theological Seminary in Ashland, Ohio. He serves as editor for the Evangelical Theological Society Dissertation and Evangelical Theological Society Studies series as well as for Sources for Biblical and Theological Studies (Eisenbrauns, Winona Lake). He is coauthor (with Bill T. Arnold) of The Face of Old Testament Studies: A Survey of Contemporary Approaches. In addition, he has written many articles, essays and commentaries.<br><br>Dr Desmond Alexander is senior lecturer in Biblical Studies at Union Theological College and associate director for Post-graduate Studies in the Institute of Theology at Queen's University, Belfast. He currently chairs the Tyndale Fellowship for Biblical and Theological Research, as well as Southern Theological Seminaries, a UK based charity committed to the establishment of a centre for theological education and vocational training in the south of Argentina.This, the first volume in the IVP Dictionary of the OT series is simple a must-have reference for anyone interested in scholarly study of the Pentateuch. At 900 plus pages, it does a good job of covering the topics that most readers would be interested in. Over 80 scholars of different denominational and scholarly backgrounds contributed essays to the volume and the quality throughout is exceptional. Highly recommended for anyone interested in the foundational books of the Old Testament. It will be going on my "recommended reading" list under OT Background and I expect to be using it and still learning from it for many years to come.

I also appreciate the manner in which the articles are written, i.e., they're substantial enough for scholars but simple enough for motivated non-scholars. I suggest that if you don't have the books in this series that you go out and get them, soon!" (Nick Norelli, Rightly Dividing the Word of Truth (rdtwot.wordpress.com), June 16, 2008)<br><br>"A fine resource for reference and research." (The Bible Today, July/August 2007)<br><br>"I like the idea of a <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch</em>, and the decision to focus on major topics is well judged. There is a great deal of very useful discussion and analysis in the volume. It should open up the study of the Pentateuch in new ways for many a reader, and I welcome the project most warmly." (Robert P. Gordon, Regius Professor of Hebrew, University of Cambridge)<br><br>"By focusing on a single main section of Scripture, the <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch</em> allows for greater scope and in-depth handling of individual topics. Well researched and comprehensive in treatment, it will be a good addition to the library of students, pastors, scholars and laypeople." (Christopher R. Seitz, Professor of Biblical Interpretation, Wycliffe College)<br><br>"The <em>Dictionary of the Old Testament: Pentateuch</em> contains a wealth of important information for all students of this foundational portion of Scripture. The articles are all written by leading scholars in the field under the guidance of two preeminent Old Testament interpreters well known for their own work on the Pentateuch. This dictionary is not only informative but also readable. I highly recommend it." (Tremper Longman III, Robert H. Gundry Professor of Biblical Studies, Westmont College)</p><h2>The Leonard Bernstein Letters</h2><p><b>An extraordinary selection of revealing letters to and from one of the titans of 20th-century music</b><br><br> Leonard Bernstein was a charismatic and versatile musician&#x2014;a brilliant conductor who attained international super-star status, and a gifted composer of Broadway musicals (<i>West Side Story</i>), symphonies (<i>Age of Anxiety)</i>, choral works (<i>Chichester Psalms</i>), film scores (<i>On the Waterfront</i>), and much more. Bernstein was also an enthusiastic letter writer, and this book is the first to present a wide-ranging selection of his correspondence. The letters have been selected for the insights they offer into the passions of his life&#x2014;musical and personal&#x2014;and the extravagant scope of his musical and extra-musical activities.&nbsp;Bernstein&#x2019;s letters tell much about this complex man, his collaborators, his mentors, and others close to him. His galaxy of correspondents encompassed, among others, Aaron Copland,Stephen Sondheim, Jerome Robbins, Thornton Wilder, Boris Pasternak, Bette Davis, Adolph Green, Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, and family members including his wife Felicia and his sister Shirley. The majority of these letters have never been published before. They have been carefully chosen to demonstrate the breadth of Bernstein&#x2019;s musical interests, his constant struggle to find the time to compose, his turbulent and complex sexuality, his political activities, and his endless capacity for hard work. Beyond all this, these writings provide a glimpse of the man behind the legends: his humanity, warmth, volatility, intellectual brilliance, wonderful eye for descriptive detail, and humor.</p><p><p><b>Nigel Simeone</b> is well known as a writer and speaker on music and is the author of several books including <i>Leonard Bernstein: West Side Story.</i> He lives in Northamptonshire, UK.</p>&#x201c;With their intellectual brilliance, humour and wonderful eye for detail, Leonard Bernstein&#x2019;s letters blow all biographies out of the water.

Integral to both globalization and religions are compelling, overlapping, and sometimes competing visions of what it means to live well.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this perceptive, deeply personal, and beautifully written book, a leading theologian sheds light on how religions and globalization have historically interacted and argues for what their relationship ought to be. Recounting how these twinned forces have intersected in his own life, he shows how world religions, despite their malfunctions, remain one of our most potent sources of moral motivation and contain within them profoundly evocative accounts of human flourishing. Globalization should be judged by how well it serves us for living out our authentic humanity as envisioned within these traditions. Through renewal and reform, religions might, in turn, shape globalization so that can be about more than bread alone.</p><p>From Miroslav Volf's <i>Flourishing:</i> <br> &nbsp; <br> Despite his fierce anger against God for letting him suffer in a communist labor camp as an innocent man and a socialist, my father, at the time a teenager on the brink of death, embraced faith in God&#x2014;as he tells the story, it was God who embraced him!&#x2014;and ended up a Pentecostal believer. The family into which I was born was a faith-island, an austere but beautiful and nurturing social microenvironment. With my first cry as a newborn, I learned that not all forms of religiosity are &#x201c;religions&#x201d; in the pejorative sense&#x2014;mind-shutting and freedom-trampling cultural edifices used as instruments of social control. <br> &nbsp; <br> The Pentecostal movement started some forty years before my father&#x2019;s conversion, in Los Angeles, 6,318 miles as the crow flies from the camp where he, a 45-kilogram&nbsp;man, was condemned to carry 80-kilogram sacks on his back. Pentecostalism&#x2019;s founder was William Seymour (1870&#x2013;1922), a black man and the son of former slaves; he was in charge of the multiracial and multiethnic mother congregation from which Pentecostalism spread worldwide. Seymour&#x2019;s faith became my father&#x2019;s faith because a Slovenian migrant worker had converted in the United States and returned back home to spread the good news. Within a single century, the faith of a downtrodden black man from the New World had engulfed the entire globe, shaped the lives of more than half a billion human beings, and garnered the sympathies of prominent religious leaders like Pope Francis. Earlier and closer to home, it delivered my father from death and made him into a new man.<b>Miroslav Volf </b>is the Henry B.

Illustrating the arduous production process, this hefty tribute showcases everything from Steve and Andy Wachowski's original stick figure sketches to the conceptual designs and dynamic, scene-by-scene storyboards (drawn and commented on by Geof Darrow, Steve Skroce and Tani Kunitake) that convinced Warner Bros. to green-light the project. Although some stunts, like Trinity's dive into a window from the top of a moving El train, were aborted because of safety and budgetary concerns, the movie closely mirrors the seamless narrative of the storyboards. In addition to the visuals, this comprehensive volume includes a final draft of the shooting script as well as scene notes and deleted script excerpts provided by Phil Oosterhouse, assistant to the Wachowski brothers. One cut that fans will find of particular interest occurs in the first scene. What was initially a segment addressing the consequences of leaving the Matrix and everyone in it is replaced by Trinity's thrilling introduction and narrow escape. The final pages will whet the appetites of Matrix enthusiasts further with an offering of several full-color promotional film shots and an enthusiastic afterword by renowned SF author William Gibson. As the first and only movie companion licensed by the Wachowski brothers, this pictorial feast is a must-have for SF fans and Matrix loyalists this gift-giving season. <br>Copyright 2000 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Everyday Battles; knowing God through our daily conflicts</h2><p><b>Every battle we face is designed to show us more of what God is like.</b> <p> In his final book, Bob Schultz delves into God's purpose for battles and conflicts in our lives.

A first novel. 75,000 first printing.</p><p>Wildly embraced by critics, readers, and contest judges (who put it on the short-list for the 2003 Man Booker Prize), <i>Brick Lane</i> is indeed a rare find: a book that lives up to its hype. Monica Ali's debut novel chronicles the life of Nazneen, a Bangladeshi girl so sickly at birth that the midwife at first declares her stillborn. At 18 her parents arrange a marriage to Chanu, a Bengali immigrant living in England. Although Chanu--who's twice Nazneen's age--turns out to be a foolish blowhard who "had a face like a frog," Nazneen accepts her fate, which seems to be the main life lesson taught by the women in her family. "If God wanted us to ask questions," her mother tells her, "he would have made us men." Over the next decade-and-a-half Nazneen grows into a strong, confident woman who doesn't defy fate so much as bend it to her will. The great delight to be had in <i>Brick Lane</i> lies with Ali's characters, from Chanu the kindly fool to Mrs. Islam the elderly loan shark to Karim the political rabblerouser, all living in a hothouse of Bengali immigrants. <i>Brick Lane</i> combines the wide scope of a social novel about the struggles of Islamic immigrants in pre- and post-9/11 England with the intimate story of Nazneen, one of the more memorable heroines to come along in a long time. If Dickens or Trollope were loosed upon contemporary London, this is exactly the sort of novel they would cook up. <i>--Claire Dederer</i><b>MONICA ALI</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;has been named by&nbsp;<i>Granta</i>&nbsp;as one of the twenty best young British novelists. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>In the Kitchen,</i><i> Alentejo Blue,</i> and&nbsp;<i>Brick Lane,</i> which was shortlisted for the Man Booker Prize.

Mahatma Gandhi, Eleanor Roosevelt, Cesar Chavez,Aung San Suu Kyi, and the most recent Nobel Prize winner, Dr.Wangari Maathai, are some of thepeople she chose to represent different eras and parts of the globe. Many started down their path to peace during childhood, and all challenge us to think about improving the lives of others. Also included in this beautiful volume are art notes, a glossary, a bibliography, further reading, and an index, making it an excellent resource for teachers and students.</p><p><b>Jane Breskin Zalben</b> is the author-artist for many books, including <i>Saturday</i> <i>Night at the Beastro</i>, which she created with her husband, Steven.&nbsp; She lives in Long Island, New York.Grade 4-8&#x2013;This handsome volume highlights 16 individuals who have worked to improve conditions for others through their words and actions. Included are writers, philosophers, Civil Rights advocates, and politicians, many of whom are Nobel Peace Prize recipients. The book focuses on celebrated individuals such as John Fitzgerald Kennedy, Martin Luther King, Jr., Eleanor Roosevelt, Cesar Chavez, and Elie Wiesel. Also covered are those newer to recognition, such as Wangari Maathai, who works for conservation in Kenya, and Aung San Suu Kyi, who fights for democracy in Myanmar. The well-written, single-page vignettes provide an interesting glimpse into the lives of these people and will pique readers curiosity and encourage them to learn more. Each biography is surrounded by an eye-catching border and faces a full-page illustration and quote from the subject. Made from fabric, etchings, watercolor, and found objects, the collages reflect Zalbens interpretation of these individuals, and the appended notes explain the various symbols and materials in the pictures. For example, Mahatma Gandhis entry mentions his 1930 Salt March to end an unfair law, while the illustration depicts an abstract beach scene sprinkled with real sea salt, and Indian paper borders the text. The accomplished, vibrant artwork and the graceful narrative clearly express each persons character, approach to life, and accomplishments, making this an enticing introduction to a diverse group of peacemakers.<i>&#x2013;Hope Marie Cook, Eastern Connecticut State University, Willimantic</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Sharing his story of how Jesus became more real to him, Tchividjian delves deeply into the fundamentals of the faith, explaining the implications of Christ&#x2019;s sufficiency� a revelation that sets us free and keeps us anchored through life&#x2019;s storms.</p><p>Ultimately, Tchividjian reminds us that Jesus is the whole of the equation as he boldly proclaims that Jesus plus nothing really <em>is</em> everything.</p></p><p><b>TULLIAN TCHIVIDJIAN<b> is pastor of Coral Ridge Presbyterian Church in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, and the author of <i>Surprised by Grace, Unfashionable, </i>and <i>Do I Know God?</i></b></b><p> In an evangelical culture where so many of us are unaware that the gospel isn t just what we believe to save us but also what sustains us and carries us into maturity, this book hammers home the gospel s power for the believer. Whether you have been in church your whole life or recently converted, this book will fuel your affections for our great God and King. <br> - <b>Matt Chandler</b>, Lead Pastor, The Village Church, Highland Village, Texas; author, <i>The Explicit Gospel</i> </p><p> There s loads of talk about the gospel these days. Some people think that talking about the gospel is trendy and that after a while we ll all calm down and get over it. Oh, I hope not. I hope that the gospel and the desire to move further into the gospel will grow and grow until it transforms our sin-wearied, unbelieving, moralistic, forgetful hearts and sets us aflame for Jesus. <i>Jesus + Nothing = Everything</i> will remind you of the ancient yet ever-fresh truth that everything we need is found in the perfections of Christ not in ourselves, not in our reputation, our relationships or wealth or accomplishments in Christ alone. If you ve never rested in the finished work of Christ this book is for you. If you ve rested in it for decades like I have, this book is for you, too. Why? Because we forget; And, although we love Jesus, we re blind to the ways in which his work connects to our daily lives and we wonder why joy and zeal are foreign concepts to us. Buy this book. Read it. It will help you push deeper into the gospel and push the gospel message more deeply into every corner of your life. Tullian Tchividjian understands like few others how the gospel shines like a beacon of hope in times of despair. Listen to him, he ll help you love the Savior more. <br> - <b>Elyse M. Fitzpatrick</b>, counselor; speaker; author, <i>Because He Loves Me</i> and <i>Comforts from the Cross</i> </p><p> Tullian Tchividjian writes like he preaches, as a man consumed with Jesus and the life-giving power of God s grace. The message of the gospel changes everything and everyone who embraces it. This book reminds us that Jesus is not only all we need He is all we want! <br> - <b>Jack Graham</b>, pastor, Prestonwood Baptist Church; former President, Southern Baptist Convention </p><p> It s so easy to forget what the Christian faith is about. We too often tell and believe religious lies that drive us to despair. I visit that dark place often because I ve been doing this religious thing for so long, have struggled so much, worked so hard, and failed so often that I fear I m becoming a cynical old preacher. <i>Jesus + Nothing = Everything</i> is cold, clear, refreshing water to a thirsty preacher and a dry church. If you read only one book this year, read this book. If you give a book to anybody this year, give this book. If you yearn for awakening in the church, underline this book and share what you ve learned. Then, with me, you ll rise up and call its author blessed. But more than that, you ll glorify the God who loves us this much. <br> - <b>Steve Brown</b>, Professor of Practical Theology Emeritus, Reformed Seminary, Orlando; radio teacher, <i>Key Life</i> --Editorial Reviews<br><br></p><p>'Many Christians today assume that the gospel just has to do with conversion, for way back when they first came to faith. They have lost the sense, well known to Christians of the past, that the gospel is for every moment of their lives. As a result, they often fall into a moralism that can be, as this book shows, just as idolatrous, self-focused, and godless as immorality. This book shows how the good news of free forgiveness in the cross of Jesus Christ is the driving energy that makes the Christian life possible. Pastor Tchividjian tells about how he himself discovered the full magnitude of God's grace in the midst of difficult times in his own ministry. He does so in a way that will bring relief, exhilaration, and freedom to struggling Christians.'<br> - <b>Gene Edward Veith Jr.</b>, provost, professor of Literature, Patrick Henry College; director, Cranach Institute, Concordia Theological Seminary; columnist; author </p><p>'Tullian Tchividjian knows, by biblical study and personal experience, that the greatest dangers to the church exist inside the church not outside and the greatest of these dangers is the subtle, deceptive, and seductive self-reliance and self-sufficiency of legalism. Perhaps the greatest contribution of this book is its page after page plea to the church not to be afraid of the glorious provisions and freedoms of the grace of Jesus.'<br> - <b>Paul David Tripp<b>, President, Paul Tripp Ministries; author, <i>What Did You Expect?: Redeeming the Realities of Marriage</i> </b></b></p><p><b><b>'In a powerful, concise, and popular style, Tchividjian announces, explicates, defends, and contrasts the gratuitous gospel of Christ's person and work with the oft-misheld conviction of us sinners that, if we are somehow to be justified, it will have to be a matter of 'making up for' our offenses and of inward improvement. Chapter-by-chapter he argues that God s saving plan is one of <i>grace</i> and not one of <i>improvement</i>. Filled with illustrations from his life as a pastor, this is no unapproachable, academic tome. But neither, thank God, is it today's 'Evangelical silly!' Tchividjian wrestles openly with demons and their central lie in order that we truly 'get' what the Bible is really about. From every point on the compass, he contrasts 'moral renovation' with a free, one-sided rescue drenched in the blood of Jesus. Good news for everyone but especially for Christians who are worn out by trying the other way, believing the lie, somehow knowing renovation isn t working but knowing nowhere else to turn. Tchividjian is out to convince his reader that justification before God really is pure gift, is free, is by grace and through faith in Christ. . . <i>sola</i>'<br> - <b>Rod Rosenbladt</b>, professor of theology, Concordia University </b></b></p><p><b><b>'I had the privilege of watching this book be written well before the ink kissed the first page.

Noted Pheonix-based cooking teacher and food writer Barbara Pool Fenzl has gathered recipes that combine innovative techniques and dynamic food combinations with historic methods and ethnic contibutions to produce dishes as vibrant and exciting as the Southwest itself; shellfish tamales with ancho cream, quail salad with pumpkin seeds, sopiapillas and jalape�o chutney and so much more.</p><p>Complementing the recipe chapters are informative essays by noted author and Southwest enthusiast Norman Kolpas, along with glorious photography that bring this wonderful region to life on the printed page. The people, geography, and history of the area are skillfully portrayed in scenic photography and richly anecdotal text. Home to such awe-inspiring natural wonders as the Grand Canyon, Arches National Park, Mesa Verde and the Sonoran Desert, this region is a land of austere beauty, rich culture and a uniquecuisine that is very much alive in this gorgeous addition to the <em>Beautiful Cookbook�</em> series.</p></p><p>Each title in this award-winning series offers an exquisite region-by-region taste tour filled with culinary specialties and surprises. Included in each large-format volume are gorgeous food and landscape photographs.Fenzl, food editor of Southwest Passages , who also runs the Les Gourmettes Cooking School in Phoenix, Ariz., and Kolpas ( Pasta Menus ) add a new regional volume to the "Beautiful" series. Like the forerunners in the series, this one is scaled oversize to accommodate not only color photographs of avocado pasta and tomatillo soup, but also of the local landscapes, such as a Native American powwow and New Mexico's San Juan mountains. As such, Southwest can be read as a gastronomic travel book, filled with escapist textures and tastes. The book is organized by locale (e.g., the Rio Grande Basin gets one chapter) and by genre (desserts and beverages; soups, stews and chilis). It's both picturesque and practical: Kolpas sets the scene well for upscale-indigenous meals with his surveys of Southwest history and habits, while Fenzl offers practical and appealing recipes (especially for salsas and the like, and for appetizers). So while the book looks glamorous, it is also useful. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Wind in the Willows (Candlewick Illustrated Classics)</h2><p>"A good choice for middle-grade readers, or for parents in search of a pleasing edition to read aloud." &#x20ac;&#x201d; BooklistKenneth Grahame&#x20ac;&#x2122;s classic tale of the pleasures of country life and the dependability of good friends will never grow old.

Los Angeles Times<br>There is a crisis in American sports, and it's getting worse. Drugs, violence, and the corrupting effects of money and fame. Even before these problems made national headlines, master writer James A. Michener was growing concerned about the state of sports in America. Only Michener could tackle a subject so big and leave us amazed and apalled by what we've learned, yet still loving the games we grew up on.<b>James A. Michener</b> was one of the world&#x2019;s most popular writers, the author of more than forty books of fiction and nonfiction, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Tales of the South Pacific, </i>the bestselling novels <i>The Source, Hawaii, Alaska, Chesapeake, Centennial, Texas, Caribbean, </i>and <i>Caravans, </i>and the memoir <i>The World Is My Home</i>. Michener served on the advisory council to NASA and the International Broadcast Board, which oversees the Voice of America. Among dozens of awards and honors, he received America&#x2019;s highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, in 1977, and an award from the President&#x2019;s Committee on the Arts and Humanities in 1983 for his commitment to art in America. Michener died in 1997 at the age of ninety.</p><h2>A Hero of Our Time</h2><p>A Hero of Our Time By J. H. Wisdom &amp; Marr Murray Translated From The Russian Of M. Y. Lermontov The book is divided into five short stories or novellas, with an authorial preface added in the second edition. There are three major narrators. The first is a young, unnamed officer in the Russian army travelling through the Caucasus mountains. He is documenting his travels for publication later. Almost as soon as the story begins, he meets Captain Maxim Maximych, who is significantly older and has been stationed in the Caucasus for a long time. He is therefore wise to the lifestyle of Russian soldiers in this region, and immediately demonstrates this to the narrator through his interactions with the local Ossetian tribesman. Maxim Maximych serves as the second narrator, relaying to his traveling companion stories of his interactions with Grigory Alexandrovich Pechorin, the main character of the story and the ultimate Byronic hero. Maxim Maximych was stationed in the Caucasus with Pechorin for some time, though when and for how long is not specified. Ultimately, Maxim Maximych gives Pechorin's diaries to the unnamed narrator. Pechorin seemingly abandoned them when he was discharged from his post, and the old Captain has been carrying them around since.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M. Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In its adventurous happenings--its abductions, duels, and sexual intrigues-- &#39;A Hero Of Our Time&#39; looks backward to the tales of Sir Walter Scott and Lord Byron, so beloved by Russian society in the 1820s and 30s.</p><h2>Fossilized Customs</h2><p>Ever wonder where the customs of Santa Claus, Halloween, Easter, the Christmas Tree, the Christmas Wreath, and many, many more come from? If so, then you need to read this book. In Fossilized Customs, you will discover the true origins of many cherished customs. They come from Babylonian sun worship, cleverly &#39;inculturated&#39; into Christianity over many centuries of darkness. The author, Lew White, addresses the unanswered questions that lurk in the back of many people&#39;s minds. It exposes the lies, and reveals the truth. These customs were re-invented so as to have different meanings, yet behind them remain the cunning ruses of an ancient spatial being, who seeks to be worshiped by means of trickery, perpetrated upon everyone alive. There is so much Paganism active in cultures today, there can be no doubt that it was deceitfully placed into our traditions, then through fraud and disguise, obscured with new meanings. Hopefully, this book will lift some of humanity out of the dense fog of history, and awaken people who are dreaming, as they walk into a new dawn of living -- with an eternal perspective. This book is written from the perspective that there is a Creator, as well as a spiritual enemy loose on Earth; and that the Scriptures of the Hebrew prophets are all true. A &#39;must read&#39; book for those wanting to know the truth.</p><p></p><h2>Night in the Haunted Tower (Pokemon Chapter Book)</h2><p>In order to defeat the Psychic Pok�emon of Gym leader Sabrina and earn a Marsh badge, Ash and Pikachu must find and tame the Ghost Pok�emon of Pok�emon Tower.</p><p></p><h2>Before I Forget: Love, Hope, Help, and Acceptance in Our Fight Against Alzheimer&#39;s</h2><p><p><i>&#x201c;I know where I&#x2019;m going.

A woman has reportedly struck a deer on a lonely coast road. When the game warden arrives on the scene, he finds blood in the road--but both the driver and the deer have vanished. And the state trooper assigned to the accident appears strangely unconcerned. </p><p><br> The details of the disappearance seem eerily familiar. Seven years earlier, a jury convicted lobsterman Erland Jefferts of the rape and murder of a wealthy college student and sentenced him to life in prison. For all but his most fanatical defenders, justice was served. But when the missing woman is found brutalized in a manner that suggests Jefferts may have been framed, Bowditch receives an ominous warning from state prosecutors to stop asking questions.</p><p><br> For Bowditch, whose own life was recently shattered by a horrific act of violence, doing nothing is not an option. His clandestine investigation reopens old wounds between Maine locals and rich summer residents and puts both his own life and that of the woman he loves in jeopardy. As he closes in on his quarry, he suddenly discovers how dangerous his opponents are, and how far they will go to prevent him from bringing a killer to justice.</p></p><p><p>Bestselling author Paul Doiron is the editor-in-chief of <i>Down East: The Magazine of Maine</i>.

All of the characters, organizations, and events portrayed in this novel are either products of the author's imagination or are used fictitiously.</p> <p>1 </p> <p>I found the wreck easily enough. It was the only red sedan with a crushed hood on the Parker Point Road. In my headlights, the damage didn't look too extensive. The driver had even managed to steer the car onto the muddy shoulder, where it had become mired to its hubcaps. </p> <p>I switched on my blue lights and got out of the patrol truck. My shadow lurched ahead of me like a movie monster. Right off, I saw the dark red pool of blood in the road--there must have been quarts of it, every ounce in the animal's body spilled onto the asphalt. I also noticed bloody drag marks where someone had moved the roadkill. But the deer itself was nowhere to be seen. The red smears just stopped, as if the carcass had been snatched up by space aliens into the night. </p> <p>Flashlight raised high in my left hand, I approached the wrecked car. The air bags had inflated, but the windshield was intact. So where was the driver? Someone had phoned in the deer/car collision. The keys were still in the ignition. Had the driver wandered off with a concussion&#x201a;�� or just gotten tired of waiting for a delinquent game warden to arrive? It was damned mysterious. </p> <p>No driver, no deer. </p> <p>I was all alone on the foggy road. </p> <p><br><br>The call had come in an hour earlier, near the end of a twelve-hour shift. </p> <p>My last stop of the day was supposed to be the house of a very tall and angry man named Hank Varnum. He was waiting for me in the foggy nimbus of his porch light: a rangy, rawboned guy with a face that always reminded me of Abraham Lincoln when I saw him behind the counter of the Sennebec Market. </p> <p>Tonight he didn't give me a chance to climb out of my truck. He just let out a snarl: "Look what those bastards did, Mike!" And he started off into the wet woods behind his house. </p> <p>I grabbed my Maglite and followed as best I could. When you are a young Maine game warden--twenty-five years old and fit--there aren't many occasions when you can truly imagine being old, but this late March evening was one of them. My knees ached from a fall I'd taken earlier that day checking ice-fishing licenses on a frozen pond, and the mud sucked at my boots with every step. Varnum had to keep waiting for me to catch up. The grocer walked like a turkey--long-legged, neck slightly extended, head bobbing as he went. But I was too exhausted to find it humorous. </p> <p>Hank Varnum owned something like seventy acres of woods along the Segocket River in midcoast Maine, and he seemed determined to lead me over every hill and dale of it. Worse yet, I discovered that my flashlight needed new batteries. The temperature had been hovering around thirty-two degrees all afternoon, and now the thaw was conjuring up a mist from the forest floor. Fog rose from the softening patches of snow and drifted like gossamer through the trees. </p> <p>After many minutes, we came out of a thicket and intersected a recently used all-terrain-vehicle trail. The big wheels of the ATVs had chewed savagely into the earth, splashing mud into the treetops and scattering fist-sized rocks everywhere. The ruts were filled with coffee-colored puddles deep enough to drown a small child. </p> <p>Varnum thrust his forefinger at the damage. "Do you believe this shit?" </p> <p>But before I could answer, he'd forged off again, turkeylike, following the four-wheel trail deeper into the woods. </p> <p>I checked my watch. What ever chance I'd had of catching a movie with my girlfriend, Sarah, was no more. Since she'd moved back into my rented house last fall, we'd been making progress reconciling our lifestyles--Maine game warden and grade-school teacher-- or so it seemed to me anyway. Tonight might be a setback. </p> <p>My cell phone vibrated. The display showed the number of the Knox County Regional Communications Center. </p> <p>"Hold up, Hank!" I answered. "Twenty-seven fifty-four. This is Bowditch." </p> <p>"Twenty-seven fifty-four, we've got a deer/car collision on the Parker Point Road." Most of my calls were dispatched out of the state police headquarters in Augusta, but I recognized the voice on the radio as being that of Lori Williams, one of the county 911 operators. "Anyone injured?" </p> <p>"Negative." </p> <p>"What about the deer?" </p> <p>"The caller said it was dead." </p> <p>So why was Lori bothering me with this? Every police officer in Maine was trained to handle a deer/car collision. Nothing about the situation required the district game warden. </p> <p>"Dispatch, I'm ten-twenty on the Quarry Road in Sennebec. Is there a deputy or trooper who can respond?" </p> <p>"Ten-twenty three." Meaning: Stand by. </p> <p>I waited half a minute while the dispatcher made her inquiries among the available units. Hank Varnum had his flashlight beam pointed into my eyes the whole time. "Are we just about there, Hank?" I asked, squinting. </p> <p>"It's right around this bend." </p> <p>"Show me." </p> <p>We went on another four hundred yards or so, crossing a little trout stream that the ATVs had transformed into a flowing latrine. Then we turned a corner, and I understood the wellspring of Hank Varnum's rage. At one time, the trail had run between two majestic oaks&#x201a;�� but no longer. </p> <p>"They cut down my goddamned trees!" The beam of Varnum's flashlight was shaking, he was so mad. </p> <p>The stumps stood like fresh-sawn pillars on either side of the trail, with the fallen trees lying, akimbo, to the sides. Yellow Posted signs were still nailed to their toppled trunks. </p> <p>"First, I put up the signs," Varnum explained. "But they came through anyway. Then I dropped a couple of spruces across the trail. They just dragged those aside. So I said, 'All right, this is war.' And I strung a steel cable between the two oaks. You see how much good that did." In fact, the cable was still attached to one of the fallen trees. </p> <p>I shined my light on the crosshatched tire tracks, feeling a surge of anger at the meaningless waste in front of me. They were beautiful red oaks, more than a century old, and some assholes had snuffed out their lives for no good reason. "Do you have any idea who the vandals are?" </p> <p>"That pervert Calvin Barter, probably. Or maybe Dave Drisko and that prick son of his. There's a whole pack of them that ride around town on those fucking machines. I swear to God, Mike, I'm going to string up barbed wire here next." </p> <p>Mad as I was, it was my job to be the voice of reason in these situations. "You can't booby/trap your land, Hank. No matter how much you might be tempted. You'll get sued. And you honestly don't want someone to get injured." </p> <p>"I don't?" He rubbed the back of his long neck, like he was trying to take the skin off. "I never had any problem when it was just snowmobiles. It was always fine by me if the sledders used my land. They never did any real damage. But these ATVs are a different story. They want to tear things up. That's part of their fun." His eyes bored into mine. "So what can you do for me here, Mike?" </p> <p>"Well, I could take some pictures of the tracks and the trees, but there's nothing to connect the ATVs with whoever cut down your oaks. If you could ID the riders coming through next time, we could file trespassing charges. Snapshots would help make the case." </p> <p>"So that's it?" </p> <p>I was about to say something about how I couldn't be everywhere at once, how I relied on citizens to help me do my job, blah, blah, blah, when I heard the roar of distant engines. </p> <p>"That's them!" Varnum said. </p> <p>I motioned him to get off the trail. We extinguished our fl ash-lights and crouched down behind some young balsams and waited. My cell phone vibrated again. Lori told me that a state trooper said he was going to respond to the deer/car collision, so I was off the hook. I turned the mobile off to be as silent as possible. The snow around me had crystallized as it had melted and become granular. It made a crunching noise when I shifted my weight. </p> <p>The engines got louder and louder, I saw a flash of headlights through the fog, and then, just as I was getting ready to spring, the shouts and revving motors began to recede. </p> <p>Varnum jumped to his feet. "They turned off down that fire road!" </p> <p>My knees cracked as I straightened up beside him. "Will they come back this way?" </p> <p>"How the hell do I know?" </p> <p>In a few weeks, the spring peepers would begin to call, but right now the forest was quiet except for the dripping trees. "Look, Hank, I know you're angry. But I promise you, we'll do what we can to catch the punks who did this." </p> <p>He didn't even answer, just snapped on his flashlight and stormed off toward home. </p> <p>I took two steps after him, and then the ground slid out from under me, and the next thing I knew I was lying face-first in the mud. When I finally dug the mud out of my eye sockets, I saw Varnum looming over me, his jaw stuck out, his anger unabated. He pulled a handkerchief from his pants pocket and threw it at me. "Wipe the dirt off your face." </p> <p>It wasn't until I'd left Varnum at his door and gotten back to my truck that I remembered I'd turned my cell phone off. Dispatch was trying to reach me on the police radio: "Twenty-one fifty-four, please respond." </p> <p>"Twenty-one fifty-four," I said. </p> <p>"Do you need assistance?" Lori sounded uncharacteristically animated. She was a good dispatcher in that she usually kept her emotions in check. That's an important skill when you deal with freaked-out callers all night. </p> <p>"No, I'm fine." </p> <p>"We couldn't reach you." </p> <p>"Sorry, I had my phone off. What's going on?" </p> <p>"Four-twelve had engine trouble. He couldn't take that deer/car." </p> <p>"You mean no one's responded yet?" I already knew where this conversation was heading. "Can't a deputy take it?" </p> <p>"Skip's dealing with an eighteen-wheeler that went off the road in Union, and Jason's bringing in a drunk driver." </p> <p>It had been at least thirty minutes since the call came through. I was mud-soaked and exhausted, with an impatient girlfriend waiting at home. And now I had to go scrape a deer carcass off the road and take down insurance information. "All right, I'm on my way." </p> <p>Parker Point was a narrow peninsula that jutted like a broken finger southward into the Atlantic. It was one of dozens of similar capes and necks carved out of the Maine bedrock by the glaciers during the last ice age. Ten thousand years might seem like an eternity, but in geological terms it was scarcely time enough to cover these ridges with a dusting of topsoil and a blanket of evergreen needles. Nothing with deep roots could thrive on Parker Point, just alders, beach roses, and bristling black spruces that blew over easily when the March winds came storming out of the northeast. </p> <p>The houses on the point had once belonged to fishing families, but as waterfront real estate prices soared and the codfish stocks collapsed in the Gulf of Maine, these homes had been increasingly sold as summer "cottages" to wealthy out-of-staters. Or they had been torn down and replaced with new shingle-sided mansions with radiant-heat floors and gated fences. I could easily envision a time, very soon, when every Maine fishermen who still clawed a living from the sea could no longer afford to dwell within sight of it. </p> <p>Because of all those no Trespassing signs, the local deer population had exploded. Without hunters to control their numbers, the animals multiplied like leggy rabbits, but their lives were no easier, and they died just as brutally. The difference was that death tended to come now in the form of starvation, disease, or, as in this case, a speeding car. </p> <p>The fog had gotten so thick, it bounced my headlights back at me. As I drove, I keyed in my home number on my cell phone and readied myself. But when I told Sarah I'd be late, her reaction was not what I'd expected. </p> <p>"That's all right, Mike," she said in a muted voice. </p> <p>"It's just that a car hit a deer in this fog," I said. </p> <p>"Was anyone hurt?" </p> <p>"Just the deer. Maybe we can see that movie tomorrow night." </p> <p>"Amy said it wasn't a good film anyway." </p> <p>Neither of us spoke for a while. Something was definitely bothering her. </p> <p>"I'm sorry I missed dinner," I offered. </p> <p>"It was just pea soup. You can heat it up." </p> <p>I tried lightening the mood. "Why do they compare fog with pea soup anyway? It's not like it's green." </p> <p>But she wouldn't play along. "I'll see you when you get home, all right?" </p> <p>"I love you." </p> <p>"Please be careful," she replied. It was the way she ended many of our calls. </p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><h2>The man who kept the secrets: Richard Helms &amp; the CIA</h2><p>Tanned and wrn dust jacket has a price label on the back and is in a protective sleeve, some marking to tanned page edges.

It was given to me on Sunday last by Carrie Collier Fritch on the occasion of my marriage to Luke McCamie Spenser. Carrie says I am to use it to record my joys and sorrows, and to keep a thorough record of our wedding trip overland to Colorado Territory and the events in the life of an old married woman. Then I&#x2019;m to send it back to her. <br>Well, maybe I will, and maybe I won&#x2019;t. <br>I was married in my navy blue China silk with the mutton-leg sleeves, a sensible dress, because I am not given to extravagances. Besides, there was not time to make a proper wedding ensemble, since Luke was anxious to be married and on our way out west. As I did not care to begin my new life with a matrimonial squall, I dutifully agreed, although meekness is not in my nature. <br>This marriage happened so fast that it took away my breath. I had no idea Luke thought of himself as my beau. Everyone believed I was a confirmed old maid, destined to do no more in life than spend my afternoons tutoring refractory scholars in grammar and penmanship, as I have done for two years. At best, I might have wed Abner Edkins&#x2014;perhaps I should say &#x201c;at worst,&#x201d; because Abner never was my choice, and if the truth be told, I would rather be an old maid than his bride. Still, I have Abner to thank for my wedded bliss. Luke said Abner confided in him that he had plans to make a proposal of marriage to me before the week was out. So although Luke had supposed he would wait a while longer before declaring himself, my Darling Boy came to the farm ahead of Abner and made known his intentions. That was exactly four weeks to the day before our marriage. <br>I was swept off my feet, as the saying goes, for I had never expected to make such a handsome match. Luke is by far the best catch in Lee County. He spent two years away at normal school before leaving to defend the dear old Union. His is a noble character, and he was one of the first to join up from Iowa, proved his mettle at Shiloh, where he was felled by a bullet. He spent several weeks in the Valley of the Shadow of Death, then was discharged and sent home to recuperate on the family farm, where his parents hoped he would stay for good. Luke&#x2019;s father owns many sections of land, on which is situated a fine house. It is much larger and grander than our humble farm, although I think ours more cheerful. <br>But farming at Fort Madison is not for Luke. He tried it for a time, but when he was fully recovered from his wounds, he went away to claim a homestead in far-off Colorado. Then he returned to claim a wife. I&#x2019;ve known Luke all my life, but I never thought of him as my lover. I had believed him to be Persia Chalmers&#x2019;s suitor because they have been keeping company ever so long. So imagine my surprise when the wife he desired was Self! <br>Luke is of a good build and height, just over six feet, with hair like the stubble left in the fields after haying, and eyes as luminously blue as agates. When he smiles, the right side of his mouth curves up more than the left. He has a pleasant countenance, and his face is not so plain as mine. Unlike my life&#x2019;s partner, I am plain all over. My form is too thin, my face too square, and my forehead broad. Being somewhat over five feet eight inches in height, I am too tall ever to be considered a looker. Handsome is the best I might be, and then only on special occasions, and in poor light. <br>My plainness does not bother Luke. He says it is an asset, since we will be living in a Godless land, where men become crazed where women are concerned. I would not want to cause him vexation by attracting admiring glances, so it seems that neither one of us has to worry about me on that score. Well, it&#x2019;s the first time I ever was glad to be plain. <br>&#x201c;You are a suitable cook and well made for work, and you&#x2019;ll have plenty of that where we&#x2019;re going. You are a strong-minded woman and not given to foolish ways. I&#x2019;m glad you&#x2019;re not the kind to attract men like bees around the honey,&#x201d; he said when he proposed. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m bound for Colorado, and if you&#x2019;re agreeable, you may come, too. I&#x2019;m clean in my ways and a Christian, and I promise to be the best husband I know how. So if you&#x2019;ll agree, Mattie, I&#x2019;d be proud to take you as my wife. I require a yes or no right away.&#x201d; <br>It wasn&#x2019;t a pretty speech. Surprised and pleased though I was, I wished there had been a little less common sense, and more passion to his proposal. I suppose a prudent man (and Luke is that) should choose a wife with the same expert eye he turns on a cow. Still, I chided him a little before giving my answer. &#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t say a word about love, Luke Spenser,&#x201d; said I. <br>He rebuked me, and rightly so. &#x201c;I thought you to be a practical girl. If it&#x2019;s words you want, you ought to wait for Abner. He&#x2019;ll be along directly,&#x201d; replied he. Then he blushed and added, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not much for that kind of talk, but do you think I would be here if I did not have feelings for you?&#x201d; <br>Well, having studied mathematics to discipline the mind during the two years I spent at Oberlin College, I think I am a practical girl&#x2014;practical enough to know Luke might find another if I did not reply at once. And perhaps it was best he spoke his mind in such a direct way, giving me a clear view of our future together instead of sugarcoating it with silly speeches. I believe Carrie is right in saying that strong men are not given to declarations of love, anyway. <br>So I meditated on it for a few moments. Marriage is life&#x2019;s most serious step for a woman, and the proposal, catching me unaware as it had, seemed to call for contemplation. Still, at that instant, I knew he had won my heart and should have my hand, as well. I replied promptly, in the manner of his proposal, &#x201c;You suit me, Luke, and so does your proposal.&#x201d; <br>What does not suit me so well is this business of the matrimonial bed. I&#x2019;ve never seen a man stark before, and it was an odd thing, though not so much of a surprise. (He has six toes on each foot, which I have not mentioned to him, as Luke does not care to be teased. Nor did I laugh at his skinny legs when first I saw them sticking out from under his nightshirt.) But it was the act itself that disappointed. Carrie had told me not to expect too much, but still, I had hoped for more. There must be a reason the cows crowd the bull, and the sows the boar. I wonder what a pig knows that I don&#x2019;t. <br>The first night, Luke did not touch me at all, which I blamed on the excitement of the day and his respect for my feelings, since I was not only ignorant of what would happen in bed but also frightened. <br>The second night, he thrashed about, hurting me a little. Then it was over. I&#x2019;d judge it took a minute, no more than two, at most. So it is not a serious loss of time. Carrie promised I&#x2019;d get used to it and even grow to like it, but I doubt that. I shall be happy to dispense with it when we have as many children as we want. I thought there would be kissing and hugging, but except for a peck on the cheek at our wedding, which embarrassed me so much that I wiped it off, Luke does not seem inclined to show such affection. <br>I precede myself. The wedding was in the dear little Methodist-Episcopal church where I grew up and until a week ago taught Sunday school. It was decorated with white lilacs and white candles. Luke gave me a ring of gold with a cluster of garnets set in it. <br>I asked Carrie to attend me so that there would be no cause for jealousy among my sisters from my choosing one above the others. Besides, Carrie is exactly my age and has ever been my dearest friend, and I wanted her beside me as I took the first step into my new life. Luke chose Abner to stand up with him, but Abner pouted so during the service that he almost spoiled the day. I was bound he should not do so, for it was my day. So I told Abner I thought Persia was sweet on him. That cheered him somewhat, although I know he would rather have me than her. Just think of it! Two men prefer me to Persia Chalmers! <br>Afterward, Father said, &#x201c;How do, Mrs. Spenser,&#x201d; and I turned to Luke&#x2019;s mother, which made everyone laugh, except for Mama Spenser, who frowned. It is a good thing we are to leave for Colorado soon, or I would have my work cut out for me on her account. <br>My own dear mother outdid herself with the tasty repast following the service. And my beloved Carrie made splendid bride and groom cakes. She hugged me as soon as the deed &#x2019;twas done and said now we were both old married women. O, I am sad at the thought of leaving her, but &#x201c;a woman is supposed to cleave to her husband,&#x201d; I told her. That was when Carrie whispered not to expect too much in bed for a while. <br>The night prior to our wedding, Luke gave me a little trunk made of black leather, lined in blue-and-white ticking, with a cunning compartment hidden in the lid. I like it fine, and I will use it to store my favorite things, including this journal. <br>In, turn, I presented Luke with a yellow silk vest that I had fashioned myself and embroidered all over with flowers. I had stayed awake late into the night to make it, and I was rewarded when Luke wore it at our ceremony. He seemed quite pleased when Persia admired it. I fancied she was jealous of me for snatching Luke away, because the saucy girl told me she&#x2019;d never seen a bride in such an ugly dress. <br>&#x201c;Why, Persia, what would make you say such a thing?&#x201d; I asked, more from surprise than annoyance. <br>&#x201c;Why would I say such a thing?&#x201d; she repeated. &#x201c;Because it is true.&#x201d; <br>So I returned the &#x201c;favor,&#x201d; and when no one was watching, I stuck out my tongue at Persia. Cry shame! Marriage has made me bold. May 17, 1865. Overland Trail, Missouri. Fifty-four miles west from Fort Madison. <br>We are off! Four days on the trail! <br>We had planned to leave the third day after our wedding, but dear, thoughtful Husband said he would give me more time for my good-byes, for who knows when we will ever see our loved ones again? Nonetheless, I was anxious to be away, since I did not want people looking at me in the way they do at all brides. It was bad enough staying with Mother and Father Spenser and knowing they were watching. And listening! <br>I thanked Luke for his consideration and did not let on that I knew the real reason for not leaving as scheduled was that he was not satisfied with the provisions. Then there was that business about the pigs. Luke had bought a sow from a farmer for us to take along, but she swolled up and did not look as if she could make the trip. I was just as glad to be rid of her, because I don&#x2019;t fancy driving a pig to Colorado. Maybe Luke changed his mind, for he asked for the return of his money instead of a second pig. I&#x2019;ve learned this much about Luke: He demands satisfaction in all things, and that makes me wonder why he chose me for his life&#x2019;s companion, as I am far from perfect. I pray he does not regret our marriage, as I will not. I should be quite out of sorts if he tried to return me like the pig, so I shall be careful not to swoll up. <br>After we agreed to be engaged, we spent every waking moment in preparation for the trip to Colorado. I gave much time to the cooking and drying and salting of food. There were quilts to be finished&#x2014;I hope Luke knows his haste is responsible for my failing to have the thirteen handmade coverlets required of brides&#x2014;and, Lordy, what a lot of packing and unpacking, then packing all over again. Luke, who is the cleverest of men, told me to store my prized Delft plate and other breakables in the barrels of flour, cornmeal, and sugar. <br>Husband warned me I could take only the most practical items. We had many a merry discussion of what fit his term of &#x201c;practical,&#x201d; and as he insists I am to be an obedient wife, he got his way. At least he thinks so. Oh, I am learning a great deal about men! I have taken my little japanned writing desk, which fits snugly on my lap, for I place the highest value on letters to and from home (as well as recording events in this journal). And hidden among the pots and pans are these little items I consider indispensable, though Husband may not: the pillow cover Carrie made from cigar silks, the hair wreath from Aunt Sabra, and, of course, my velvet bonnet with the cunning flowers. Bonnets are my especial weakness. I brought along a sunbonnet, too, but it is an ugly, hateful thing. I wore it all last summer in the fields, but now that I am Mrs. Luke Spenser, I&#x2019;ve grown vain and hope that I shall never have to wear it again. <br>I insisted on taking my little walnut commode, which was Grandmother McCauley&#x2019;s and is filled with my clothing and our bedding. It is the repository, as well, for my Holy Bible and Dr. Chase&#x2019;s Recipes, or Information for Everybody, for which I gave a dollar. Sister Mary tucked in scraps of rose madder-dyed goods for a quilt and pillow slips trimmed in lace. She and the other girls at home worry that I will not have pretty things in Colorado Territory, but I say I don&#x2019;t need them. The way Luke describes our new homestead, I think it will be prettier than anything I could take with me. <br>This little book comes, too, hidden in the secret compartment of the trunk. Luke has not seen my journal yet, and I do not propose to show it to him, since I could not confide in it if I knew Luke were to read my words&#x2014;although I do not think he could do so easily, since when I finish writing across a page, I turn it so that I can write crosswise over the entry. I do not like keeping secrets from my &#x201c;guardian and master,&#x201d; but I fancy he may have one or two from me. We have so much to learn about each other. Of course, this means I may write only during moments when Luke is not around. Just now, he is off discussing oxen with the men. <br>There are not so many prairie ships headed for St. Joseph as earlier in the season, since it is very late in the year for emigrants to embark. Besides, some travelers take the stage and are then outfitted on the Missouri. Luke felt we could do better with our money by buying some of our farm implements at home and avoiding as much as possible the gougers at St. Joe. It is not the most direct route, says Husband, but we can get the best provisioning there. The wagons we see are pulled by oxen, but we are transported by six grays, which Luke&#x2019;s father gave us as a wedding present. They are as handsome a team of horses as there ever was, but more suited to carriages than to a Conestoga. I confided such to Luke, for I know as much about a farm as any man, but he said he hadn&#x2019;t solicited my opinion. He has asked everybody else&#x2019;s opinion, however, about whether to swap the horses for mules or oxen when we get to St. Joe. I shall try to do as Carrie warned me, keeping my mouth shut and managing Luke in other ways. <br>We had been married nearly a week before we pulled out. Though we were early astir, Mother, Father, and my three sisters and two brothers were there to see us off. They slept only a few hours before rising for chores and hurrying to the Spensers&#x2019; place, where Luke and I were nearly ready to embark on our adventure. I miss the folks dreadfully already, especially the girls, as we were always a merry group&#x2014;and Carrie, too. She begged me not to forget her, and she said if we did not meet again in this life, we would surely be together in the next. Luke frowned when I pointed to the ground, meaning Hell, but Carrie and I broke into fits of the giggles. <br>As we started off, my youngest sister, Jemima, who is six, ran after the wagon, crying for her &#x201c;sugar.&#x201d; Luke stopped, but I could see he was vexed at doing it. So I let her love my neck and gave her the briefest of kisses. She had to content herself with waving us out of sight and shouting, &#x201c;Ho for Colorado!&#x201d; <br>Luke did not scold her, however.

Historian Stephen Walmsely&#39;s persuasive study of the loyalist governor of Massachusetts Bay portrays an honorable but unimaginative official who remains true to his aristocratic conception of duty but helpless to arrest the forces wrenching his native land away from Crown rule. Putting a human face on an epic conflict, Walmsley finds hutchinson&#39;s radical opponents motivated less by ideas and principles than by ambition, greed, and personal animus. Indeed, Walmsley&#39;s graphic description of the mob violence, deployed by the patriots to intimidate Hutchinson and subvert the rule of law, will leave readers pondering who were the villains and who the heroes in this superb reconsideration of the nation&#39;s origins.&#34;-Allen Matusow, Rice University &#34;A candid and readable biography . . .

But she can't always blame the men-after all, a soot-caked woman barking orders and smelling of smoke isn't the biggest turn-on in the world. Then she meets Bo Goodnight, who seems different.

A series of fresh arson fires sets the stage for this appealing, suspenseful romance, which combines a large Italian family, their pizza restaurant, a new love interest, a mystery, and a pyromaniac with revenge on his mind. Joyce Bean delivers the goods with a cadence that matches the suspense. The secondary plot involving Reena's sister and her unfaithful husband is stellar, matching voice to mood with choking tears and harsh breathing. Bean's versatile vocal range skillfully portrays male and female parts without hesitation.

II experiences, from his assignment to the infantry due to a paperwork error to a fearful trans-Atlantic crossing on the Queen Mary, to landing under heavy fire on Omaha Beach and the Liberation of Paris. After the war, he began a distinguished literary career as a long-time editor at the <i>New Yorker</i>, and chronicles the magazine&#x2019;s rise and influence on postwar American culture with wit and grace.<br></p><p>Born in 1917, Gardner Botsford was a distinguished editor at <i>The New Yorker</i> from the late 1940s, following his military service in W.W. II, until his retirement in 1982.<br>Botsford, a former New Yorker editor, pulls off a difficult balancing act in this graceful memoir. He covers brutal WWII experiences in highly charged, reportorial detail, then switches effortlessly to his wealthy, No&#x2030;l Coward-flavored background. Beginning with his soldier days, he backtracks to his years at Yale and colorfully portrays his mother, Neysa McMein, a celebrated beauty and international heartbreaker who attracted such friends as Alexander Woolcott and George Abbott. Botsford's writing ability first surfaced with a humor column he wrote in college, and he began at the New Yorker as an underpaid contributor. The book, always compelling, becomes impossible to put down when he focuses on the legendary William Shawn. He describes the editor as "a hermetically sealed intellectual" and points out why the two formed a friendly but consistently uneasy alliance: Shawn "tiptoed through life as though through a minefield.... I was forever getting into fights, arguing with cab drivers.... I was wildly irrational." Despite Botsford's ambivalent feelings about his colleague, he tells the story of Tom Wolfe's scathing Shawn expos&#x201a; in the New York Herald Tribune with unbiased clarity, making readers feel Shawn's despair at being publicly unmasked. The last section, in which Shawn fights against appointing a successor until Si Newhouse fires him, is a chilling demonstration of how desperately people cling to power. Beyond Botsford's precisely drawn, touching closeups of such authors as Maeve Brennan and A.J. Liebling, he makes readers understand an editor's life and responsibilities. His editorial rules of thumb provide enlightening material for readers and writers alike.

"One wonders if women still exist, if they will always exist, whether or not it is desirable that they should ...," she says in this comprehensive treatise on women. She weaves together history, philosophy, economics, biology, and a host of other disciplines to show women's place in the world and to postulate on the power of sexuality. This is a powerful piece of writing in a time before "feminism" was even a phrase, much less a movement.Introduction by Margaret Crosland; Translation by H. M. Parshley</p><h2>Calder</h2><p><strong>The man who put the swing into sculpture</strong> &nbsp; When the final tally of key movers in the plastic arts of this century is compiled, there is no doubt that maestro of movement Alexander Calder (1898-1976), the man who put the swing into sculpture, will be near numero uno. Calder took it off the plinth, gave it to the wind, and left us kinetic playgrounds of the spirit. He operated at the point where Modernity and nature fused, developing an environmental art that changed the medium forever. Visiting his Paris atelier in 1932, Duchamp coined the term "Mobiles" for Calder`s delicate wire and disc pieces, constructions that would soon become immensely popular.<br> <br> But he didn&#x2019;t rest on his innovations. Friends with Miro, Mondrian and Leger, Calder also turned his hand to painting, drawing, gouaches, toys, textiles and utensil design. A graphic master who sketched as much in air as in ink, the Sixties and Seventies saw Calder take on the monumental, translating the dynamics of cities into both his Mobiles and "Stabiles". At a time when sculpture was perceived to be the antithesis of movement, Calder unmade gravity and freed the elements in a body of work that is still sending a wind of change through the art world today. &nbsp; <strong>About the Series:</strong><br> Each book in TASCHEN&#x2019;s Basic Art Series features:<ul> <li>a detailed chronological summary of the life and oeuvre of the artist, covering his or her cultural and historical importance</li> <li>a concise biography</li> <li>approximately 100 colour illustrations with explanatory captions</li> </ul></p><p>Jacob Baal-Teshuva, born 1929, is author, critic and independent curator of museum shows. He studied at the Hebrew university in Jerusalem and the New York University. His numerous publications include works on Marc Chagall, Alexander Calder, Jean-Michel Basquiat, Andy Warhol and Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Jacob Baal-Teshuva lives and works in New York and Paris.In art, mobile and Alexander Calder are synonymous. Indeed, without Calder, <i>mobile</i> might not be an art term at all. His constructions of brightly colored, flat metal shapes, some or all of which are suspended so that any current of air can move them, constitute a body of modern artwork that is genuinely popular as well as famous. They revive in adults the delighted fascination of an infant with shiny objects dangled just beyond its grasp. It is no surprise, then, to learn from Baal-Teshuva's enthusiastic sketch of Calder that he made toys, at first for his sister, when as young as eight and . . . never stopped. (Another nonsurprise is that his friend Miroinfluenced him; many Calder pieces would fit perfectly into a roomful of Miros.) He also made <i>stabiles</i>, or stable sculptures, paintings, and jewelry. A great many examples in all his characteristic media appear in splendid color in this paperback, which has to be one of the great current bargains among art books.

Pleasant. 1987. PSm $12.95; pap. $5.95. Grade 1-5 Yes, the American Girls series is written to formula, and yes, it is heavily promoted commercialy to sell dolls and related accessories. But the dolls are well crafted and so are the stories. Each book ends with several pages of illustrated factual ``Looking Backward'' information. The writing style is lively, the characters believable although not deeply delineated, and the action in the short chapters is enough to hold the attention of young readers. The birth of Kirsten's baby sister and the making of a friendship quilt along with her tenth birthday party at a barn-raising are the major events of Kirsten's story, set in Minnesota in 1854. The discussion of the dangers of tornadoes and the high mortality of infants in those days add serious notes to the generally happy tale. Samantha's fancy tenth birthday party in 1904 is followed by a trip to New York City and a wild chase after a mischievous puppy, ending at a suffragette meeting. Molly changes her romantic view of wartime England and faces reality when an evacuated British girl her age comes to share her home and birthday. In all the volumes the easy-to-read type and the realistic color illustrations, both full-page and vignette, add to the attractiveness of these unintimidating volumes. Sylvia S.

He lives in Boulder, Colorado.Reservations, long mired in poverty and oppression, have become rallying points for Native American society, according to this stirring history of the tribal sovereignty movement. Energized by the Civil Rights movement's gains and pressing their claims under long-dormant treaties, Indian tribes have taken control of reservation government from an autocratic Bureau of Indian Affairs, regained lost lands, asserted hunting and fishing rights, jump-started reservation economic development and revived Indian languages and culture. Wilkinson (<i>American Indians, Time, and the Law</i>; etc.), formerly an attorney for the Native American Rights Fund and now a law professor at the University of Colorado, ranges widely over the sovereignty movement, emphasizing the court cases&#x2014;like the Pacific Northwest salmon controversies and the wrangles over reservation gambling&#x2014;that have expanded tribal rights. His sympathetic treatment extols the movement's success in redressing historic injustices, but sometimes skates too easily over difficulties in squaring ethnically based sovereignty with principles of democracy and equal citizenship. (He cites one reservation on which 50 Indians controlled a tribal government claiming jurisdiction over 3,000 non-Indian residents.) And he sometimes defends Native American prerogatives by invoking a cultural uniqueness&#x2014;Indians' spiritual connection to the land, for example, may entitle them to "flexibility" in complying with environmental laws&#x2014;that smacks of essentialism. But the story of the Native American renaissance is an inspiring one, and this book marks a deserving chapter.

If I want something bad enough, I feel I'm gonna get there."</i><p>Michael Phelps is one of the greatest competitors the world has ever seen. From teen sensation in Sydney to bona fide phenom in Athens, he is now -- after the Beijing Games -- a living Olympic legend. With an unprecedented eight gold medals and world-record times in seven events, his performance at the 2008 Games set a new standard for success. He ranks among the most elite athletes in the world, and is both an inspiration and a role model to millions. The incredible focus he exhibits in practice and during competition propels him forward to his unrivaled excellence. In <i>No Limits</i>, Michael Phelps reveals the secrets to his remarkable success, from his training regimen to his mental preparation and, finally, to his performance in the pool. </p><p>Behind Phelps's tally of Olympic gold medals lies a consistent approach to competition, a determination to win, and a straightforward passion for his sport. Like Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods, he has learned to filter out distractions and deliver stellar performance under pressure. The road has not always been easy; from the very beginning, Phelps had to overcome physical setbacks and emotional trials. When he was younger, he was diagnosed with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder; other kids bullied him; even a teacher said he would never be successful. Later, he had to work through injuries that jeopardized his career. In this book, Phelps talks for the first time about how he has overcome these and other challenges - about how to develop the mental attitude needed to persevere, not just in athletic competition but in life. </p><p>His success is imbued with the perspective of overcoming the obstacles that come your way and believing in yourself no matter the odds.</p><p><i>No Limits</i> explores the hard work, commitment, and sacrifice that go into reaching any goal. Whether it is on the starting block during an Olympic swim meet or in the weight room on a typical day, Phelps's dedication has led him to unparalleled excellence. Filled with anecdotes from family members, friends, teammates, and his coach, <i>No Limits</i> gives a behind-the-scenes look at the makings of a real champion. One of Phelps's mottos is "Performance Is Reality," and it typifies his attitude toward achieving his goals. It's easy to get bogged down by doubt or to lose focus when a challenge seems out of reach, but Phelps believes that you can accomplish anything if you fully commit yourself to it. Using the eight final swims of the Beijing Olympics as a model, <i>No Limits</i> is a step-by-step guide to realizing one's dream.</p></p><p><b>Michael Phelps</b> is an American swimmer.&nbsp; He holds the record for winning the most gold medals (8) in a single Olympics (2008).&nbsp; He has won 16 Olympic medals, 14 gold and two bronze.&nbsp; He holds seven world records and has over 20 World Championship medals. After returning home from Beijing in 2008, Michael used the well-publicized $1 million dollar Speedo bonus to start the Michael Phelps Foundation through which he hopes to encourage children to lead healthy, active lives, and to continue to grow the sport of swimming.&nbsp; He now resides in Baltimore, MD with his dog Herman.<br><br><b>Alan Abrahamson</b> is an award-winning sportswriter and a recognized authority on the Olympics.

Among other honors, Alan won the 2002 National Headliner Award for sports writing and was named the Los Angeles Press Club's 2004 sports journalist of the year. Alan and his wife, Laura, and their three children live in Southern California.Michael Phelps, who won eight gold medals at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, talks about his swimming career, his preparation, and his dream of bringing the sport to greater prominence in the United States. Introduced by Phelps himself, the book is read by Holter Graham with a voice that matches the tone of Phelps&#39;s writing: a touch of cockiness offset by hard work and dedication to his sport. Listeners whose interest in Phelps has been piqued by recent news won&#39;t find much scandal here, although Phelps discusses his DUI arrest and tackles the issue of doping. The emphasis on training and preparation, however, will be of special interest to athletes. J.A.S. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Kafka on the Shore</h2><p>&#34;A stunning work of art,&#34; the New York Observer wrote of The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, &#34;that bears no comparisons,&#34; and this is also true of this magnificent new novel, which is every bit as ambitious, expansive and bewitching. A tour-de-force of metaphysical reality, Kafka on the Shore is powered by two remarkable characters. At fifteen, Kafka Tamura runs away from home, either to escape a gruesome oedipal prophecy or to search for his long-missing mother and sister. And the aging Nakata, who never recovered from a wartime affliction, finds his highly simplified life suddenly upset. Their odyssey, as mysterious to us as it is to them, is enriched throughout by vivid accomplices and mesmerizing events. Cats and people carry on conversations, a ghostlike pimp employs a Hegel-quoting prostitute, a forest harbors soldiers apparently unaged since World War II, and rainstorms of fish fall from the sky. There is a brutal murder, with the identity of both victim and perpetrator a riddle. Yet this, like everything else, is eventually answered, just as the entwined destinies of Kafka and Nakata are gradually revealed, with one escaping his fate entirely and the other given a fresh start on his own.</p><p>The opening pages of a Haruki Murakami novel can be like the view out an airplane window onto tarmac. But at some point between page three and fifteen--it's page thirteen in <i>Kafka On The Shore</i>--the deceptively placid narrative lifts off, and you find yourself breaking through clouds at a tilt, no longer certain where the plane is headed or if the laws of flight even apply. <p> Joining the rich literature of runaways, <i>Kafka On The Shore</i> follows the solitary, self-disciplined schoolboy Kafka Tamura as he hops a bus from Tokyo to the randomly chosen town of Takamatsu, reminding himself at each step that he has to be "the world�s toughest fifteen-year-old." He finds a secluded private library in which to spend his days--continuing his impressive self-education--and is befriended by a clerk and the mysteriously remote head librarian, Miss Saeki, whom he fantasizes may be his long-lost mother. Meanwhile, in a second, wilder narrative spiral, an elderly Tokyo man named Nakata veers from his calm routine by murdering a stranger. An unforgettable character, beautifully delineated by Murakami, Nakata can speak with cats but cannot read or write, nor explain the forces drawing him toward Takamatsu and the other characters.</p> <p> To say that the fantastic elements of <i>Kafka On The Shore</i> are complicated and never fully resolved is not to suggest that the novel fails. Although it may not live up to Murakami's masterful <i>The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle</i>, Nakata and Kafka's fates keep the reader enthralled to the final pages, and few will complain about the loose threads at the end. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Haruki Murakami was born in Kyoto in 1949. His works include A Wild Sheep Chase; The Elephant Vanishes; Hard-boiled Wonderland and the End of the World; Norwegian Wood; Dance Dance Dance; South of the Border, West of the Sun; The Wind-up Bird Chronicle; Sputnik Sweetheart; and Underground: The Tokyo Gas Attack and the Japanese Psyche; after the quake and Birthday Stories.</p><h2>The Naming of Names: The Search for Order in the World of Plants</h2><p><p><b>An exhilarating new book from the author of the worldwide bestseller <i>The Tulip</i></b>.</p><p><i>The Naming of Names </i>traces the search for order in the natural world, a search that for hundreds of years occupied some of the most brilliant minds in Europe.</p><p>Redefining man's relationship with nature was a major pursuit during the Renaissance. But in a world full of poisons, there was also an urgent practical need to name and recognize different plants, because most medicines were made from plant extracts.</p><p>Anna Pavord takes us on a thrilling adventure into botanical history, traveling from Athens in the third century BC, through Constantinople, Venice, the medical school at Salerno to the universities of Pisa and Padua. The journey, traced here for the first time, involves the culture of Islam, the first expeditions to the Indies and the first settlers in the New World.</p><p>In Athens, Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus was the first man ever to write a book about plants. How can we name, sort, and order them? He asked. The debate continues still, two thousand years later.

She contributes to a number of magazines, both in the US and the UK and regularly fronts programmes for BBC Radio 3 and 4. She chairs the Gardens Panel of the National Trust and sits on the Parks and Gardens Panel of English Heritage.</p>Pavord, author of the The Tulip and an expert gardener, traces the history of plant taxonomy from the ancient Greeks to 17th-century British botanist John Ray in this hefty tome, and though her passion for plants is apparent on every page, readers who don't share the same level of enthusiasm will be frustrated by Pavord's encyclopedic approach. Pavord, in prose as rich and colorful as the too-infrequent illustrations, contextualizes plant classification within larger intellectual, political and cultural spheres, but she verges dangerously close to writing a textbook; the vast amount of information she packs into brief, rapid-fire sections can overwhelm. In the best sections, she slows down to draw detailed portraits of researchers and describe how each contributed to the slowly evolving (and, until the late 1600's, unnamed) science of botany. Ray, for instance, marked "a quiet, lonely, dogged consummation" with "no fireworks, no claps of thunder, no swelling symphonic themes" when, shortly before his death and suffering from gangrene, he penned the six fundamental rules of botany. Pavord's prose dazzles, but it's not enough to carry readers with a casual interest in plants or gardening through an otherwise dense history. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

A tragedy of unimaginable proportions is about to befall Mitch Rapp -- and he must use all his cunning, skill and ruthless determination to stay alive and seek vengeance against the traitor who would bring him down. </p><p></p></p><p>#1<i> New York Times</i> bestselling author Vince Flynn (1966&#x2013;2013) created one of contemporary fiction&#x2019;s most popular heroes: CIA counterterrorist agent Mitch Rapp, featured in thirteen of Flynn&#x2019;s acclaimed political thrillers. All of his novels are <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers, including his stand-alone debut novel, <i>Term Limits</i>. The Mitch Rapp story begins with <i>American Assassin</i>, followed by <i>Kill Shot</i>, <i>Transfer of Power</i>,<i> The Third Option</i>, <i>Separation of Power</i>,<i> Executive Power</i>,<i> Memorial Day</i>, <i>Consent to Kill</i>, <i>Act of Treason</i>, <i>Protect and Defend</i>, <i>Extreme Measures</i>, <i>Pursuit of Honor</i>, <i>The Last Man</i>, <i>The Survivor, Order to Kill, Enemy of the State, </i>and<i> Red War. American Assassin </i>was released as a major film in 2017.Prelude <p>To kill a man is a relatively easy thing--especially the average unsuspecting man. To kill a man like Mitch Rapp, however, was an entirely different matter. It would take a great deal of planning and a very talented assassin, or more likely assassins who were either brave enough or crazy enough to accept the job. The latter was more than likely the type who would take on the challenge, for any sane man by definition would have the sense to walk away. </p><p>Even with the element of surprise on their side, though, they would need to catch Rapp with his guard down so they could get in close enough to finish him off once and for all. The preliminary report on his vigilance did not look good. The American was either hyperalert or insanely paranoid. Every detail of their plan would have to come together perfectly, and even then, they would need some luck. They'd calculated that their odds for success were probably seventy percent at best. That was why they needed complete deniability. If whoever they sent failed, Rapp would come looking for them. And despite their positions of great power, they had no intention of spending the rest of their lives with a man like Mitch Rapp hunting them. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2005 Vince Flynn</p></p><h2>The New McCall&#39;s Cookbook</h2><p>The New McCall&#39;s Cookbook by Mary Eckley.</p><p></p><h2>Christmas with Tucker (A Dog Named Christmas)</h2><p><b>The touching prequel to the bestselling novel</b><i> A Dog Named Christmas</i><br>&nbsp;<br>The sleeper hit of 2008, <i>A Dog Named Christmas</i> became a Hallmark Hall of Fame movie a year later, seen by more than twelve million people in the United States alone.

Her first novel, Blackkerchief Dick, was published in 1923 when she was 19. Her first work of detective fiction was a serialized story published by the Daily Express in 1927. Entitled The White Cottage Mystery, it contained atypical themes for a woman writer of the era. Her breakthrough occurred in 1929 with the publication of The Crime at Black Dudley. This introduced Albert Campion, albeit originally as a minor character. He returned in Mystery Mile, thanks in part to pressure from her American publishers, much taken with the character. Campion proved so successful that Allingham made him the centrepiece of another 17 novels and over 20 short stories, continuing into the 1960s.</p>Your head may well be aching along with Campion's as thesleuth awakens to find he has amnesia and a looming dread that somemomentous event hangs in the balance that only he can put right. Timeticks along as he becomes buried under more and more incomprehensibleinformation. Unable to recognize even the faithful Lugg or his ownfianc�e, Campion struggles desperately to put the pieces togetherwhile the very fate of England is at stake. A bit on the convolutedand melodramatic side perhaps, but it's all made enjoyable by thesheer breadth of talent brought to bear by narrator FrancisMatthews. It's a pure pleasure to listen to this man talk. He createsa persona for his characters that never slips while moving adroitlyamong various strata of British society. His professional approach tothis material gleans from it every possible bit of entertainment.D.G. � AudioFile 2003, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>What You Think of Me Is None of My Business</h2><p>Cole-Whittaker&#39;s innovative methods for human resource development, self-motivation and personal growth are available here in this book.

Pepperberg and Alex, an African Grey parrot who proved scientists and accepted wisdom wrong by demonstrating an astonishing ability to communicate and understand complex ideas. A <i>New York Times </i>bestseller and selected as one of&nbsp;the paper&#x2019;s&nbsp;critic&#x2019;s<i> </i>Top Ten Books of the Year, <i>Alex &amp; Me </i>is much more that the story of an incredible scientific breakthrough. It&#x2019;s a poignant love story and an affectionate remembrance of Pepperberg&#x2019;s irascible, unforgettable, and always surprising best friend.</p></p><p><p>On September 6, 2007, an African Grey parrot named Alex died prematurely at age thirty-one. His last words to his owner, Irene Pepperberg, were "You be good. I love you."</p><p>What would normally be a quiet, very private event was, in Alex's case, headline news. Over the thirty years they had worked together, Alex and Irene had become famous&#x2014;two pioneers who opened an unprecedented window into the hidden yet vast world of animal minds. Alex's brain was the size of a shelled walnut, and when Irene and Alex first met, birds were not believed to possess any potential for language, consciousness, or anything remotely comparable to human intelligence. Yet, over the years, Alex proved many things. He could add. He could sound out words. He understood concepts like bigger, smaller, more, fewer, and none. He was capable of thought and intention. Together, Alex and Irene uncovered a startling reality: We live in a world populated by thinking, conscious creatures.</p><p>The fame that resulted was extraordinary. Yet there was a side to their relationship that never made the papers. They were emotionally connected to one another. They shared a deep bond far beyond science. Alex missed Irene when she was away. He was jealous when she paid attention to other parrots, or even people. He liked to show her who was boss. He loved to dance. He sometimes became bored by the repetition of his tests, and played jokes on her. Sometimes they sniped at each other. Yet nearly every day, they each said, "I love you." </p><p>Alex and Irene stayed together through thick and thin&#x2014;despite sneers from experts, extraordinary financial sacrifices, and a nomadic existence from one univer�sity to another. The story of their thirty-year adventure is equally a landmark of scientific achievement and of an unforgettable human-animal bond.</p><p>Irene M.

Adam One, the kindly leader of the God's Gardeners--a religion devoted to the melding of science and religion, as well as the preservation of all plant and animal life--has long predicted a natural disaster that will alter Earth as we know it. Now it has occurred, obliterating most human life. Two women have survived: Ren, a young trapeze dancer locked inside the high-end sex club Scales and Tails, and Toby, a God's Gardener barricaded inside a luxurious spa where many of the treatments are edible.</p> <p>Have others survived? Ren's bioartist friend Amanda? Zeb, her eco-fighter stepfather? Her onetime lover, Jimmy? Or the murderous Painballers, survivors of the mutual-elimination Painball prison? Not to mention the shadowy, corrupt policing force of the ruling powers...</p> <p>Meanwhile, gene-spliced life forms are proliferating: the lion/lamb blends, the Mo'hair sheep with human hair, the pigs with human brain tissue. As Adam One and his intrepid hemp-clad band make their way through this strange new world, Ren and Toby will have to decide on their next move. They can't stay locked away...</p> <p>By turns dark, tender, violent, thoughtful, and uneasily hilarious, <i>The Year of the Flood</i> is Atwood at her most brilliant and inventive. </p> <strong>Margaret Atwood on <i>The Year of the Flood</i></strong><br><br> I&#x2019;ve never before gone back to a novel and written another novel related to it. Why this time? Partly because so many people asked me what happened right after the end of the 2003 novel, <i>Oryx and Crake</i>. I didn&#x2019;t actually know, but the questions made me think about it. That was one reason. Another was that the core subject matter has continued to preoccupy me. <p></p> <p>When <i>Oryx and Crake</i> came out, it seemed to many like science fiction--way out there, too weird to be possible--but in the three years that passed before I began writing <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, the perceived gap between that supposedly unreal future and the harsh one we might very well live through was narrowing fast. What is happening to our world? What can we do to reverse the damage? How long have we got? And, most importantly--what kind of "we"? In other words, what kind of people might undertake the challenge? Dedicated ones--they&#x2019;d have to be. And unless you believe our planet is worth saving, why bother? </p> <p>So the question of inspirational belief entered the picture, and once you have a set of beliefs--as distinct from a body of measurable knowledge--you have a religion. The God&#x2019;s Gardeners appear briefly in <i>Oryx and Crake</i>, but in <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, they&#x2019;re central. Like all religions, the Gardeners have their own leader, Adam One. They also have their own honoured saints and martyrs, their special days, their theology. They may look strange and obsessive and even foolish to non-members, but they&#x2019;re serious about what they profess; as are their predecessors, who are with us today. I&#x2019;ve found out a great deal about rooftop gardens and urban beekeeping while writing this book!</p> <p>Another question frequently asked about <i>Oryx and Crake</i> concerned gender. Why was the story told by a man? How would it have been different if the narrator had been a woman? Such questions led me to Ren and Toby, and then to their respective lives, and also to their places of refuge. A high-end sex club and a luxury spa would in fact be quite good locations in which to wait out a pandemic plague: at least you&#x2019;d have bar snacks, and a lot of clean towels.</p> <p>In his book, <i>The Art Instinct</i>, Denis Dutton proposes that our interest in narrative is built in--selected during the very long period the human race spent in the Pleistocene--because any species with the ability to tell stories about both past and future would have an evolutionary edge. Will there be a crocodile in the river tomorrow, as there was last year? If so, better not go there. Speculative fictions about the future, like <i>The Year of the Flood</i>, are narratives of that kind. Where will the crocodiles be? How will we avoid them? What are our chances? <i>--Margaret Atwood</i></p> <p>(Photo � George Whiteside)</p>Margaret Atwood&#x2019;s internationally bestselling fiction includes <b>The Handmaid&#x2019;s Tale</b>, <b>Alias Grace</b>, <b>The Blind Assassin</b>, and<b> Oryx and Crake</b>.

By the best-selling author of Iron Orchid.</p><p><b>Stuart Woods</b> is the author of more than thirty novels, including the <i>New York Times</i>-bestselling Stone Barrington series and Holly Barker series. An avid sailor and pilot,<b>I</b><p>Holly Barker arrived at CIA headquarters, in Langley, Virginia, at her usual seven thirty a.m., parked the car in her reserved spot and took the elevator to her floor. She set her briefcase on the desk, hung her coat on the back of the door and sat down, ready to do the work she always did before her boss, Deputy Director for Operations, or DDO, Lance Cabot, arrived. To her surprise, the door between their adjoining offices opened, and he stood there, looking at her in his wry way.<br>&#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and no cracks about how early I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;<br>Holly smiled. &#x201c;Good morning,&#x201d; she replied.<br>&#x201c;Come in.&#x201d; He stood aside and let her pass into his office, which was much larger and more luxuriously furnished than hers. Rumor was that Lance had furnished the office out of his own pocket, but Holly knew him better than that. He was much more likely to have found a way for the Agency to pay the tab. He waved her to a seat.<br>&#x201c;Coffee?&#x201d; he asked, picking up a pot from the paneled cupboard that contained a small kitchenette and a fully stocked bar.<br>&#x201c;Yes, thank you.&#x201d;<br>Lance poured them both a cup and sat down at his desk. &#x201c;Have I ever told you how good you are at your job?&#x201d; he asked.<br>Holly blinked. &#x201c;Not in so many words.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve both been working on this floor for three years,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;and, quite frankly, I think you could do my job as well as I do.&#x201d;<br>Holly blinked in astonishment. Lance had always been miserly with praise, apparently believing that a &#x201c;well done&#x201d; sufficed.<br>&#x201c;Except for the politics,&#x201d; Lance said.<br>He was right about that, she knew. &#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re hopeless at the politics.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m working on that,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Yes, but you&#x2019;re still hopeless.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Not without hope of improvement,&#x201d; she said, contradicting him.<br>Lance smiled a little. &#x201c;Well, you can hope.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lance,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;I hope this is all a prelude to a big promotion, a larger office, a huge increase in salary and a Company Cadillac.&#x201d; This was said less than half in jest.<br>&#x201c;As I said, Holly, you can hope.&#x201d; Lance pushed back from his desk, crossed his legs and sipped his coffee. &#x201c;Actually, you have to leave us.&#x201d;<br>Holly clamped her teeth together to keep her jaw from dropping. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know how to respond to that,&#x201d; she managed to say.<br>Lance&#x2019;s eyebrows went up. &#x201c;Oh, it&#x2019;s only for a time, say a month.&#x201d;<br>Holly stared at him, uncomprehending.<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not firing you,&#x201d; he clarified.<br>&#x201c;Good, then I won&#x2019;t have to kill you,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;Now what the hell are you talking about?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not doing the talking; other people are.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Talking? Not about you and me, surely.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Well, maybe that, too. What they&#x2019;re talking about is Teddy Fay.&#x201d;<br>Teddy Fay was a name never mentioned at Langley, a great embarrassment to everyone in the building, except to those who secretly rooted for him. Teddy was the former deputy chief of Technical Services, the division that supplied operational officers with everything they needed to accomplish their missions: a weapon, a wardrobe, an identity or a cyanide capsule. Whatever, Tech Services obliged. But Teddy Fay, after retiring, had gone off the reservation, had started killing right-wing political figures, Middle Eastern diplomats&#x2014;anyone who Teddy felt did not have the best interests of his country at heart&#x2014;and no combination of the Agency&#x2019;s and the FBI&#x2019;s resources had been able to stop him or even find him. Holly was the only CIA employee who had ever even seen him since his retirement and then only when he was disguised.<br>&#x201c;Am I getting blamed for Teddy Fay?&#x201d; she asked.<br>&#x201c;Not exactly,&#x201d; Lance replied. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s just felt that you&#x2019;ve had a number of opportunities to kill him and you haven&#x2019;t done so.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lance, I&#x2019;ve seen the man only once when I knew who he was, and, on that occasion, I managed to put a bullet in him.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yes, but not in the head or the heart,&#x201d; Lance pointed out. &#x201c;And given that, during your schooling at the Farm, you ran up the highest scores with a handgun of any trainee ever, some wonder why you didn&#x2019;t do just a little better. In fact, I myself have wondered.&#x201d;<br>Holly had wondered about that, too. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t dignify that with a response,&#x201d; she said, by way of saying nothing. She almost said that she was not an assassin but thought better of it.<br>&#x201c;Be that as it may, you are just a little too hot around here at the moment, so take some leave. The director has had a word with the higher-ups, complaining about the unused leave time that some officers have allowed to pile up, and you&#x2019;re high on the list. You&#x2019;ve got nine weeks coming, and it&#x2019;s time you took some time.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Lance, I&#x2019;ve got an awful lot on my plate right now.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You need a change of diet,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;And, you might recall, we&#x2019;ve made a few modifications in that house of yours in Florida.&#x201d;<br>Holly had nearly forgotten about that, and she had not visited the house since. &#x201c;That wasn&#x2019;t my idea.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Go there. E-mail or call, if you can&#x2019;t stand being out of touch, but go.&#x201d;<br>Holly sighed. &#x201c;Well, I guess I could clean up my desk in a few days,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got two hours to write me a memo on what&#x2019;s pending, so I can reassign the work, then you&#x2019;re out of here.&#x201d; He paused for a reaction and got none. &#x201c;Are you hearing me?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing that job for the director,&#x201d; she said. She had grown fairly close to Katharine Rule Lee, the director of Central Intelligence, and she wanted to further that relationship.<br>&#x201c;This request comes from the director; I&#x2019;m only passing it on. Give me the file; I&#x2019;ll handle it.&#x201d;<br>Holly threw up her hands.<br>&#x201c;Why are you still sitting there?&#x201d; Lance asked.<br>&#x201c;All right, all right,&#x201d; Holly said, then slouched out of the big office and to her desk. Her work was neatly filed, and she made a stack of folders as she wrote her memo. She was done in exactly two hours. She knocked on Lance&#x2019;s door.<br>&#x201c;Come in.&#x201d;<br>She walked into the room to find the director sitting where she, herself, had sat earlier that morning.<br>&#x201c;Good morning, Holly,&#x201d; Kate Lee said.<br>&#x201c;Good morning, Director,&#x201d; Holly replied. She set the bundle of file folders on Lance&#x2019;s conference table, then handed him the memo and watched while he read it through.<br>&#x201c;I thought I&#x2019;d stop in and reassure you before you leave,&#x201d; the director said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not that we&#x2019;re trying to get rid of you; it&#x2019;s just that we&#x2019;re . . . well, trying to get rid of you for a little while. We needn&#x2019;t go into why.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I understand,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;At least I think I do.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;This will pass,&#x201d; the director said. &#x201c;After all, Lance has assured me that Teddy Fay is still dead.&#x201d;<br>Holly nodded as if she agreed.<br>&#x201c;Oh, by the way, Lance probably hasn&#x2019;t told you this, if I know him, but we&#x2019;re bumping you up to executive grade, and, in addition to the salary increase and a few perks, you now have a new title: Assistant Deputy Director of Operations&#x2014;ADDO&#x2014;effective immediately.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you, Director,&#x201d; Holly said with real appreciation, &#x201c;and no, Lance didn&#x2019;t tell me.&#x201d; She shot him a glance.<br>Lance tossed her memo on his desk. &#x201c;Oh, get out of here,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Let us know your whereabouts.&#x201d; He tossed her an envelope. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll need this.&#x201d;<br>The director stood up and offered her hand. &#x201c;Congratulations, Holly. Now go and buy yourself a very nice present.&#x201d;<br>Holly flew.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>Holly packed her Cayenne Turbo as lightly as she could and spoke to Daisy, her Doberman pinscher. &#x201c;All right, Daisy, you can get in now.&#x201d; Daisy, who had been sitting by the car, waiting for instructions, leapt lightly into the front passenger seat of the SUV.<br>Daisy had been beautifully trained by an old army buddy of her father&#x2019;s who had met an untimely end. Holly had bought her from the man&#x2019;s daughter, and she and Daisy had bonded at once.<br>Holly got onto I-95 south, set the speed control at eighty and switched on the radar detector. The device was illegal in Virginia, but what the hell, it was cleverly concealed, and it looked for cops both ahead and behind while jamming their lasers long enough for her to slow down.<br>They spent the first night in a motel near Charleston and got moving early the next morning. She called her father, Hamilton Barker, from there and told him she was on the way. By late afternoon she was at the bridge over the Intracoastal Waterway, then she turned onto the side road that led to her father&#x2019;s house, on a little island, where he lived with his longtime girlfriend and recent wife, Virginia.<br>She pulled into the yard and let Daisy out of the car. Daisy ran through the open door and came back with Ham and Ginny, and hugs and kisses were exchanged, not least by Daisy.<br>&#x201c;You want a drink?&#x201d; Ham asked.<br>&#x201c;No, I want to get to the house and settle in,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;I just wanted to say hello on the way. How about dinner tomorrow night?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Ginny said. &#x201c;Come here, and I&#x2019;ll cook.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re on,&#x201d; Holly replied.<br>&#x201c;I went to take a look at your place a few weeks ago,&#x201d; Ham said, &#x201c;but I was met by some grim-faced guy packing a handgun and told to go away. I figured he was one of yours.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, he was,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;The Agency did some work on the house.&#x201d;<br>Ham made a grunting noise. &#x201c;I never knew they were building contractors,&#x201d; he said.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;d be surprised at some of the things the Agency does,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;Come on, Daisy, let&#x2019;s go home.&#x201d; Daisy jumped back into the car. &#x201c;See you tomorrow night,&#x201d; Holly said, and drove away.<br>She crossed the bridge and turned south on A-1A, the road that ran the length of the state&#x2019;s barrier islands. She drove through the little community of Orchid Beach and a couple of miles south turned into her driveway. She was immediately brought up short by a heavy wrought-iron gate hanging on reinforced concrete posts. &#x201c;What the hell?&#x201d; she muttered.<br>She opened her briefcase and took out the envelope Lance Cabot had given her. There were some papers, some keys and a remote control. She pressed the remote&#x2019;s button, and the gate swung open, closing behind her automatically as she drove through.<br>Holly stopped at the front door and got out of the car with Daisy, who was obviously glad to be home. She fumbled with the new keys, noticing that they had none of the usual teeth, just what seemed to be a row of magnets. The door, of painted steel, was new. She got a key into the lock, and it took two complete turns to open the door. She checked the door&#x2019;s edge, and when she turned the key again, not one but three six-inch steel bolts emerged that would slide into the steel door frame. Impressive. She heard the security system beeping and found a new keypad next to the door. The papers in the envelope Lance had given her revealed her new entry code, and she used it to disarm the system. She noted in the instructions that any breach of security would be sent electronically, not to a local security company but directly to Langley.<br>She unloaded her things while Daisy ran around sniffing at everything in the house. Holly walked into the living room and looked around. Everything seemed exactly the same, even the old magazines on the coffee table. Then she noticed that her view of the beach and ocean through the picture windows and sliding doors had a slightly greenish cast. She inspected them and found that the glass in the windows and doors was now an inch and a half thick. Good for hurricanes, she reckoned.</p></p><h2>Minecraft Combat Handbook</h2><p>In Minecraft, you&#39;re never alone and the threat of attack is constant. How will you survive?

Salvatore was born in Massachusetts in 1959. His love affair with fantasy, and with literature in general, began during his sophomore year of college when he was given a copy of J.R.R. Tolkien s The Lord of the Rings as a Christmas gift. He promptly changed his major from computer science to journalism. He received a Bachelor of Science Degree in Communications in 1981, then returned for the degree he always cherished, the Bachelor of Arts in English. He began writing seriously in 1982, penning the manuscript that would become Echoes of the Fourth Magic. His first published novel was The Crystal Shard from TSR in 1988 and he is still best known as the creator of the dark elf Drizzt, one of fantasy s most beloved characters.

This is her first book.Chapter 1<br><br>You See, I Used to Live Here<br><br>In 1978 I visited Budapest for the first time. I lived in Dijon from January until June of the year between college and graduate school, and my parents met me in Zurich, where some of my mother&#x2019;s many relatives lived. Together the three of us toured France and Italy before arriving at our ultimate destination, Budapest.<br><br>A complete role reversal occurred when we were in Europe together. For the first time in my life, I did not mediate conversations between one of my parents and a shop clerk or a waiter or a bus driver or a flight attendant or a person on the street. Instead I was mute and inarticulate, as my parents, my incompetent immigrant parents, speaking French or German or, eventually, Hungarian, handled the quotidian minutiae that used to be my secure domain. I felt bad enough when infantilized in private conversation, but this all felt horribly, extravagantly public.<br><br>Somehow I remember our time in Hungary all as being rainy and gray, though my journal describes beautiful spring days. The city in 1978 still looked traumatized from its World War II siege and the Hungarian revolution of 1956. Bullet holes marked buildings, and dirt spewing from both factories and small Soviet cars left a haze in the air and soot on the walls and a vague headache for the first few days. And yet the grandeur of the Danube, the intricate pillars and crevices of the Parliament building rising on its left bank, the craggy hills of Buda, the flat, urban density of Pest, the sweeping bridges, and the reconstructed castle district all seemed familiar.<br><br>Images from My First Book of Hungary by Istv�n Csicsery-R�nay, a frequent Patterson Street guest, were now life-size and three dimensional. The book was published in 1967, and its introduction was the perfect example of the Hungarian self-involvement that I never witnessed at Patterson Street but that I grew to appreciate among some �migr�s:<br><br>Hungary, or Magyarorszag (maw-dyawr-or-sahg), as the Hungarians call their country, may well be called the land of the middle. It lies in Central Europe; it is halfway between two corners of Europe (the Strait of Gibraltar and the Ural Mountains); and it is halfway between the North Pole and the Equator.<br><br>Dispensing with latitudes and longitudes, Hungary is simply the center of the universe.<br><br>My father brightened as we approached the city of his birth, the only place on the planet where he ever felt at home, despite all its radical changes. Sitting in the front seat of the cab we took from the airport, he engaged the driver in a wide-ranging conversation about national politics and local concerns. Even though he was already seventy-five, he was vigorous and energetic. He was voraciously curious and well informed, so he knew what to ask. When I casually remarked on the presence of soldiers at the airport, he, ever vigilant, shot me a warning look that said such observations should be kept quiet.<br><br>While my parents were both from Budapest, more than the thirteen years that separated their ages divided their experiences. My mother&#x2019;s world of the rich but new Jewish aristocracy had once, when he was a very young man, been vividly a part of my father&#x2019;s middle-class resentments, class tensions, and misunderstandings. In his 1929 diary he wrote defiantly, &#x201c;I always had an insensible prejudice toward the rich and powerful&#x2014;maybe because I am neither of those and would like to be both. . . . I always had a sense for the social distances, especially upward, and I am proud of having that sense.&#x201d; It became clear to me that while my parents&#x2019; two families obviously did not represent all of Hungarian society, the Szegedy-Masz�ks and the Kornfelds did embody two defining elements of the myriad tensions of Hungarian identity.<br><br>My father&#x2019;s family&#x2014;Catholic, upper middle class, and steeped in their Hungarian identity&#x2014;would have seen nothing unusual about locating Hungary halfway between the north pole and the equator.<br><br>My mother&#x2019;s Jewish, cosmopolitan, well-traveled, multilingual, and wealthy family would have smiled with just a trace of condescension at such grandiosity.<br><br>My father led us through winding streets and away from the tourist centers into the run-down neighborhood where my aunt Lilly lived in one of the most depressing apartments I had ever seen in my life. The building smelled bad. We walked up a few flights and knocked on a very dirty door. After entering a small, dingy hall, we saw to the left a kitchen with a black iron stove, no hot water, a tiny refrigerator, and filth. The center of the apartment was the living, dining, and bedroom, with a dirty bed presiding. Each wall was covered with pictures, but the whole room was like a curio shop, so full of memorabilia as to make one gasp for air.<br><br>Lilly, my father&#x2019;s beloved sister&#x2014;who had saved their parents during the terrible Siege of Budapest and who knocked on every official&#x2019;s door and called in every family favor in an effort to get my father out of Dachau&#x2014;lived here. Now she was old and sick and alone except for the resentful presence of her younger sister Musi, who always believed that Lilly had things easy in comparison with her hard life. Lilly lay in this squalid lair looking at paintings that were another reminder of all that she had lost.<br><br>They were mostly painted by my father&#x2019;s great-grandfather, who was one of Hungary&#x2019;s most accomplished nineteenth-century masters, Mikl�s Barab�s. The Masz�ks came from Bohemia, and there were several army officers among them. My father&#x2019;s grandfather, Hugo Szegedy-Masz�k, had studied art with Barab�s before deciding to become a journalist, but he continued his relationship with the great painter by marrying his daughter Ilona and having ten children, one of whom was my father&#x2019;s father, Alad�r. Strained relations existed between the father-in-law and his daughter&#x2019;s husband, and as impressive as Hugo&#x2019;s intellectual energy was, his capacity to provide for his ever-growing family was erratic at best.<br><br>Still, what Hugo lacked in financial acumen, he more than made up for in creative energy. He began a short-lived art periodical and became the secretary of the newly formed Council of Fine Arts, a position he held for eighteen years. In 1882, in the interests of freeing the Hungarian press from the pressures of the Viennese news agency, he established the Hungarian News Service, which he headed for sixteen years. In 1887 he was granted nobility. The letter explained that &#x201c;as recognition of your achievements in the areas of public education and the fine arts you are most graciously granted Hungarian nobility and the use, exempt from any fees, of the &#x2018;Pesti-Szegedy&#x2019; title of nobility.&#x201d; Much as the British confer nobility with a geographical honorific, this title indicated that he was from Pest&#x2014;the two cities had not yet been united. He died in 1916.<br><br>Alad�r&#x2019;s father, who was also named Alad�r, grew up in that highly intellectual, slightly chaotic milieu aswirl with children and paint boxes and literary ambitions. One of his sisters became a portraitist and a well-known Theosophist, whose claim to fame in the family was not her religious or artistic inclinations but the small yet comprehensive library located in her bathroom. And there were suicides, three or four of them, that my father would allude to during some of his darkest moments.<br><br>Artists, Theosophists, misunderstood geniuses, chronically depressed intellectuals, all populated the extended Szegedy-Masz�k family. But the twin burdens of great intellect and depressive tendencies skipped Alad�r senior&#x2014;who was the head of the Imperial Hungarian Court in Budapest and by all accounts enjoyed an irascible but charming personality&#x2014;and landed in a highly concentrated form in his only son.<br><br>My Szegedy-Masz�k grandfather, spry and dapper it seems even as a young man, his goatee trimmed with surgical precision, craved a more ordinary, or at least a more orderly, life and joined the military. There he eventually rose in the Hapsburg monarchy and was put in charge of the royal palace.<br><br>At the last coronation of a Hungarian king in December 1916, the height of my grandfather&#x2019;s prestige was captured in a photo that hung on Lilly&#x2019;s apartment wall and in my father&#x2019;s office. As the royal herald preceding the new king, Alad�r Senior, dressed in an elaborate national costume called a diszmagyar, sat erect on a royal horse. It seems he peaked at that moment, as did the nation he represented, since both his career and the empire collapsed within two years. The much-longed-for ennoblement never reached him, and his wife, the formidable Sarolta Moldov�nyi, was deeply disappointed.<br><br>Sarolta&#x2019;s family was from Transylvania, so Trianon&#x2014;the treaty that followed World War I and redrew the borders of Hungary so that the country lost two-thirds of its land and half of its population&#x2014;was not just a geopolitical abstraction for her but a very real severing of the heart of her heritage, albeit a heritage from the eighteenth century. She was one of five children of S�ndor Moldov�nyi, who was an industrious pharmacist in Budapest. He even established the first bandage factory in Hungary, and in 1885 he received a medal at the Hungarian Art and Trade Fair in Budapest. My grandmother Sarolta was a devout Catholic, ambitious and organized and full of hopes, first for her husband and then for her only son.<br><br>After the First World War inflation ravaged the country, and my grandfather&#x2019;s job disappeared with the monarchy. Following the brief intermezzo of Communism, the Horthy regime took power, and an old friend helped my grandfather secure a job, or at least the title, as the head of some economic office of the regent. His new colleagues had little respect for the old monarchist anachronism, and going to work where there was no real work, only to receive a paycheck, demoralized my grandfather.<br><br>My father as a young man saw the fortunes of the family buffeted by political storms and saw his own father descend from a kind of greatness to graceful, genteel defeat as he dressed for a pretend job with a very real salary every day. My father attended gymnasium and the University of Budapest and eventually went to the �cole Libre des Sciences Politiques in Paris, fulfilling the hopes of both his parents.<br><br>Yet as he sat in his sister&#x2019;s pitiable apartment, the guilt of all his failures as a son and brother looked like a literal burden on his back and shoulders. He had promised his parents that he would take care of her, and over and over again in his journals, he would write about the anguish of not fulfilling that promise.<br><br>One afternoon in Budapest my mother and I visited Andr�s Belyus, who had been the head butler for her family ever since she could remember. His apartment was meticulous, the mantelpiece, bookcases, and side tables festooned with many photographs of my grandparents, my mother, her brothers, her sister, the family estate in Ireg, and their city apartment on Lendvay Street. He had begun his service to the family as a valet to my great-uncle Paul. Soon he became indispensable to the whole family.<br><br>He would become the dominant force in the Kornfeld household. At lunch or dinner, he stood at the serving table in the dining room, wearing his green or gray uniform and his white gloves, listening attentively to the conversations, and responding with silent precision to the slightest need of one of the guests or family members. His wife was a manicurist in the most prestigious barbershop in Budapest, so between the two of them, they could probably have reconstructed most of the social and political gossip of the city.<br><br>Belyus never sat down as he poured tea and reminisced with my mother about times he could share with no one in Hungary. I watched her, the hapless Scout leader, the frantic lunch mother, the Woman Who Never Wore Pants, the &#x201c;bank and chauffeur&#x201d; now become the gracious baroness. Not haughty and most of all not inauthentic, she was more comfortable than I had ever witnessed.<br><br>Later that day we took the little subway, the first in continental Europe, up Andr�ssy Avenue&#x2014;although at that time it had been renamed N�pk�zt�rsas�g �tja, or Republic Avenue of the People&#x2019;s&#x2014;and emerged in my mother&#x2019;s old neighborhood. All the homes had gone through several incarnations, from private villas to chopped-up apartments, but the grandest was the former home of her grandfather, Manfred Weiss, at 114 Andr�ssy Avenue. Now the official Russian guesthouse, the home was spectacular, with muscular, half-naked marble men supporting the sweep of balcony. My mother told me that once tennis courts and stables had occupied the far corner of the property, but no longer. When the house was built, it was even wired with electricity. When my grandmother and her sisters had dance parties, an electrician was hired to spend the night in case any emergency repairs were needed.<br><br>Marianne Weiss lived with her parents and five brothers and sisters on the first floor of the villa, while her maternal grandparents and great-grandmother lived on the second floor. My grandmother always said that the best time to have been alive was in the early twentieth century, before World War I. Budapest was at the pinnacle of its history. No longer the shabby junior partner to Vienna in the Austro-Hungarian Empire, it blossomed with culture and new architecture and all the benefits of a world-class city.<br><br>It must have been especially nice if your father was Manfred Weiss, who did much to industrialize Hungary. He began modestly enough with a factory in the Budapest city limits that canned plum preserves. Eventually he expanded the canning to include other food and his market to include the military. He noticed that the cans themselves were a handy shape that could be enlarged and made into little military stoves, or contracted to become bullets. Since a factory that used gunpowder near the heart of a busy city tempted fate, he bought a plot of land on an island in the middle of the Danube called Csepel and built the Manfred Weiss Works. The Austro-Hungarian army was so impressed with its work that they asked him in 1887 to manufacture shell casings, magazines, and ammunition boxes, and its German affiliate was awarded a contract by the German government to manufacture ammunition boxes for the army Mausers.<br><br>As the factory fortunes rose with war, so they fell during times of peace. Weiss then poured money into Budapest real estate: some slices of Andr�ssy Avenue, a hotel in the inner city, a big chunk of land in a rich agricultural region known as the Angyalf�ld, and a significant piece of property near the Danube, in an undeveloped area where the Margaret Bridge stood.<br><br>As with many nineteenth-century entrepreneurs, the accumulation of wealth was not Manfred Weiss&#x2019;s compelling need but a happy by-product of his truly compelling need, which was to make things. He was a creative genius, and his muse and motivation was the majesty of a huge factory, a new kind of factory that mass-produced a range of products in quantities undreamed of before in Hungary. But this factory would not exploit the workers strictly for profit, because a benevolent father ruled it.</p><h2>True Crime</h2><p>Two men meet on death row. One is a convicted murderer scheduled to die at midnight; the other is a cynical, self-destructive journalist who races the clock to prevent the law from making the ultimate mistake. <b>True Crime</b> is a newspaperman's minute-by-minute account of his race over the course of nine hours to find evidence that will exonerate the condemned man, and of that man's increasingly desperate struggle to hold on.</p><p><i>True Crime</i> is an edge-of-the-seat suspense novel that graphically portrays the final moments leading up to a condemned killer's appointment with the executioner. The plot is familiar but convincing: An inmate, Frank Beachum, denies any involvement in the murder of a young pregnant woman. His only chance for survival lies in the hands of a reporter, Steven Everett. From the very first page, however, veteran suspense writer Andrew Klavan does everything possible to make this journalist unlikable--he drinks too much, he's committed adultery. In fact, the incarcerated Beachum, who stands accused of a hideous crime, comes across as a much more decent person than Everett. <p> Foes of capital punishment will find in <i>True Crime</i> another buttress to the oft-expressed argument that state-sanctioned murder is not always just, that some police investigations are sloppy even when they're not politically tinged or racially motivated, and that exonerating evidence is often overlooked. Here such evidence is so glaringly overlooked that it's possible for a somewhat drunken reporter with plenty of other things on his mind (a wife who's about to leave him and a boss who's just discovered that Everett is cuckolding him) to spot the inconsistencies. He follows a hunch, discovers the identity of the real killer, and tries to clear Beachum's name as the minutes tick away. The relentless pace and Klavan's crisp, taut writing make the suspension of disbelief possible, and no doubt Clint Eastwood, who stars in the movie version, will make Steven Everett a more likely and likable hero. <i>--Jane Adams</i></p>"Time flies when you're having fun, waiting to die, or reading <i>True Crime,</i> Andrew Klavan's nerve-plucking suspense novel...A beat-the-clock suspense thriller."<br><i>--The New York Times Book Review</i><p>"A classic . . . <i>True Crime</i> moves like a tornado, its plot turning in tighter and tighter circles until it explodes in an ending that will leave readers exhausted. . . .

Sometimes the ogre started smashing things just for the joy of it, or squeezing the juice from stones one-handed, making an awful mess. Sometimes the nymph was rather empty-minded, or threw a tantrum. That was why Esk had made this cosy hideout that no one else knew about. Whenever things became too difficult at home, he came here to relax and unwind. He loved his parents, but there was virtue in solitude too.He paused to look about and listen carefully. He didn&#x2019;t want any creature of Xanth, tame or wild, seeing him enter, because then the location would be no secret, and sooner or later his folks would learn of it, and his privacy would be lost.His hideout was in the hollow trunk of a dead beerbarrel tree. He had been lucky: he had been in the vicinity in the month of AwGhost, when barrel trees gave up the ghost if they were going to, and had seen the spirit departing. &#x201c;Aw, Ghost!&#x201d; he had exclaimed in the classic ogre manner, and that had enchanted the tree so that he could take over the husk without creating a local commotion. He had cut a door in the fat trunk that sealed tightly so that it didn&#x2019;t show from outside, and made vents so that the steamy beer smell could dissipate; his mother, Tandy, would never understand if he came home reeking of beer! Then he had set straw in the bottom, and brought in pillows from a nearby pillow bush, and carved decorative scenes in the walls, and made it perfect. He was rather proud of himself; his only regret was that he could not afford to boast of his accomplishment, because of the necessity for secrecy.All seemed clear. He hooked his nails into the crevice and pulled the door open. It was a small door, with an irregular outline, so that its contour was not obvious. He ducked down to step through, then drew it carefully closed behind. He stepped across the floor and dropped onto his nest of pillows.&#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d;Esk jumped. &#x201c;Who said that?&#x201d; he demanded.&#x201c;Get your fat mule off me!&#x201d; The voice came from below.He looked but saw only pillows. &#x201c;My fat what?&#x201d;&#x201c;Your fat donkey!&#x201d; the voice snapped. &#x201c;Pony, horse, jackass, whatever&#x2014;off!&#x201d;Esk finally got a glimmer of the word that was being sought. He got quickly off the pillows. &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;The pillow shifted outline. A mouth formed in its center. &#x201c;Here, you oaf! What did you think you were doing, putting gross anatomy like that in my face?&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, I&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Never mind. Just don&#x2019;t do it again, moron.&#x201d;&#x201c;But pillows are <i>supposed</i> to be&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh? Did you ever ask the pillows&#x2019; opinion about that?&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, actually, no, but&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;So there, imbecile! Now get out and let me sleep.&#x201d;Esk got out. Then, as he wended his way home, he pondered. How had he been able to talk to a pillow? He knew of only one person who could talk to an object, and that was the King of Xanth, Dor. Since it was generally understood that talents did not repeat, except in the case of the curse fiends, that meant that it wouldn&#x2019;t be Esk&#x2019;s talent. Beside that, he already had a talent: that of protesting. Sometimes his mother said he protested too much, but she did not deny it was magic. Since no one had two magic talents, that, too, eliminated the possibility of talking to inanimate things.Finally he worked it out. He was not the smartest person, being quarter ogre, but he never let go of a problem, being half human, and usually was able to come to some kind of settlement, however crude. It wasn&#x2019;t his magic, but the pillow&#x2019;s magic. He must have picked a special pillow, without realizing: one that was alive. All he needed to do was take it back out to the pillow bush and exchange it for another, and his problem would be solved.Reassured, he continued on toward home, having forgotten whatever problem had brought him to his hideout. As he neared it he smelled the delicious odor of purple bouillon. That meant that his father, Smash, had gone into his full ogre guise and foraged for the makings. Smash was actually only half ogre, for Esk&#x2019;s grandparents on that side had been Crunch Ogre and an actress from the curse fiends. But when Smash got ogreish, no one could tell him from a full ogre; he swelled up horrendously and burst out of his trousers. Tandy, however, being of nymphly stock, preferred Smash as a man, so usually that was what he seemed to be.Esk could not voluntarily turn ogre, but when he got mad enough or desperate enough he did develop some ogre strength. It never lasted long, but of course it didn&#x2019;t need to; one strike by an ogreishly-powered fist could pulverize the trunk of a rock maple tree. Similarly, he was normally inept at acting, but when he really had to he could become temporarily proficient. That was his heritage from his curse fiend grandmother. Most of the time it was his human heritage that dominated, since he was part human through both of his parents. He was a pretty ordinary person, with gray eyes and nondescript brown hair. He often wished he were otherwise, but really had no choice; he was obviously not destined for any sort of greatness.But there was no use worrying about that: there was purple bouillon to be eaten!<br><br>Two days later, being bored, Esk returned to his hideout. He entered and checked the pillows. They all looked normal. &#x201c;Which one of you is the live one?&#x201d; he inquired, but had no answer.He shrugged. He picked up the whole mass of them and took them out to the pillow bush, unceremoniously dumping them beside it. Then he picked several new ones. He had to do this periodically anyway, so they didn&#x2019;t get dirty and stale. He carried these to his tree and plopped them down inside.He hesitated, then eased himself down on them. Contrary to what the living pillow had said, his posterior was not fat; in retrospect he wished he had corrected the pillow about that matter. But he always thought up the smart responses way too late. That, again, was part of his heritage: neither ogres nor nymphs were known for their quickness of wit.He was hungry, so he brought out a pie he had picked some time ago. It was a humble pie, and they were always best when properly seasoned. This one was decked with sodden raisins, and had a crust that was rocklike, while its main body seemed to be decomposing. It was definitely ready for consumption.He brought it to his mouth and took an ogreish bite. His teeth came down, dug in&#x2014;and the pie erupted in his face. Raisins popped out and flew at his eyes, and the crust writhed against his lips. &#x201c;Get your ugly cat out of here!&#x201d; the pie exclaimed.&#x201c;My ugly what?&#x201d; Esk asked, startled.&#x201c;Your ugly kitten, feline, grimalkin, tabby&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, you mean my ugly puss?&#x201d; he inquired, catching on.&#x201c;Your ugly whatever,&#x201d; the pie agreed, forming a wide mouth. &#x201c;Just what did you think you were doing, ogreface?&#x201d;&#x201c;Ogreface?&#x201d; Esp repeated, appreciating the compliment. Then he realized that the pie probably hadn&#x2019;t meant it that way. &#x201c;I was trying to&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh you were, were you! Well, don&#x2019;t do it again!&#x201d;&#x201c;But&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;You never asked the pie whether it wanted to be chewed on, did you?&#x201d;&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s humble pie! It&#x2019;s meant to be eaten!&#x201d;&#x201c;A likely story. Now get your dim-witted face out of here so I can rest.&#x201d;&#x201c;Listen, pieface, this is <i>my</i> hideout!&#x201d; Esk said, developing a smidgeon of heat. &#x201c;I just tossed out an obnoxious pillow, and I&#x2019;ll do the same with you! You sure aren&#x2019;t very humble!&#x201d;&#x201c;You just try to toss this cookie, and you&#x2019;ll be sorry, bean-brain!&#x201d;That did it. Esk carried the pie to the door, pushed the door open, and skated the disk out into the forest. Then he plumped down on his bed of pillows for a snooze.It was a moderately cool day, and while true ogres loved cold weather, Esk didn&#x2019;t. He cast about until he found the tattered old blanket he had salvaged for this purpose, and drew it over him.The blanket writhed and wrapped itself around his feet. Then it squeezed his legs, and inched up his torso, constricting as it did.&#x201c;Hey!&#x201d; Esk exclaimed.&#x201c;Hay yourself, moo-brain!&#x201d; the blanket said, forming a mouth on its surface. But it did not pause in its squeezing; Esk&#x2019;s legs were getting uncomfortable.Abruptly concerned, he thrust his legs apart, the ogre strength coming to him. The blanket tore&#x2014;but then it fogged and rose up as a flying thing, hovering before him. &#x201c;Listen, dung-head,&#x201d; its mouth said, &#x201c;now I&#x2019;m <i>really</i> going to make you sorry!&#x201d;But Esk&#x2019;s ogre dander was up. He grabbed the blanket with both hands. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see about that, threadface!&#x201d; Then he tore it asunder.The pieces fogged again. The whole thing became vapor. This time it re-formed into the shape of a demoness. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re stronger than you look, bug-wit. But how long do you think you can oppose me?&#x201d;&#x201c;What wit?&#x201d; Esk asked, confused again.&#x201c;Flea-wit, ant-wit, chigger-wit&#x2014;&#x201d;&#x201c;Oh, nitwit!&#x201d;&#x201c;Whatever. Why don&#x2019;t you answer the question?&#x201d;Now at last Esk caught on. &#x201c;The pillow&#x2014;the pie&#x2014;they were all you! You assumed their forms!&#x201d;&#x201c;Of course I did, genius,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;I was trying to get rid of you gently. But now it&#x2019;s no more Miss Nice Gal. I&#x2019;m going to twist you into a pretzel and feed you to a dragon.&#x201d; In her natural form she had arms and hands, which were now reaching for him.&#x201c;Dragons don&#x2019;t eat pretzels,&#x201d; he said, realizing he was in trouble. Demons (or demonesses) were notorious; they had inhuman strength and no conscience, and they could pass right through solid walls. If he had realized what he was dealing with, he would have left her alone. Now it was too late.&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll jam you down its mouth anyway,&#x201d; she said grimly. &#x201c;Maybe it will forgive me in a century or two.&#x201d; The hands closed on his neck and squeezed.But this stimulated his ogre strength to full potency. Contrary to popular lore, ogres didn&#x2019;t really like getting twisted into pretzels, whatever they might do to others. Esk grabbed her wrists and wrenched them apart. &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; he demanded.&#x201c;I am the Demoness Metria,&#x201d; she replied, fogging again. Her arms and hands reappeared at his throat, leaving his own hands empty. &#x201c;DeMetria for short. Who are you?&#x201d;Esk grabbed her wrists again, and wrenched them outward again. &#x201c;I am Eskil Ogre, and I&#x2019;m not going to let you choke me.&#x201d;&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what you think, mortal,&#x201d; she said. Her substance fogged yet again and re-formed, and this time her arms were linked by a length of thin rope. She hooked this over his head and looped it around his neck. &#x201c;You can&#x2019;t get this off before you&#x2019;re done for.&#x201d;&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Esk gasped.Now she seemed startled. &#x201c;No?&#x201d; Her grip relaxed.Esk balled a fist and smashed her in the face. The blow was solid, but her head simply folded back on the neck, as if hinged, then snapped back into place as he withdrew his arm. She looked slightly aggravated.&#x201c;No,&#x201d; he repeated. &#x201c;I protest it.&#x201d;She reconsidered. &#x201c;Well, maybe not. I suppose it would be pointless to kill you; your body would only stink up the region, and I don&#x2019;t care to haul it far enough so the smell wouldn&#x2019;t carry.&#x201d; The cord dissolved into vapor and coalesced about her arms; it was evidently part of her substance.&#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m going to throw you out of here!&#x201d; Esk said, his ogre aspect still in force.&#x201c;I&#x2019;d like to see you try it, mundaneface.&#x201d;Mundaneface! Her insults were getting more effective. That kept his ogre aspect in force. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll try it!&#x201d;He tried it. He grabbed her about the middle and hauled her off her feet. Then he paused. Her body was humanoid and naked and voluptuous, and was now tightly pressed against him. He had been distracted by her words and actions, but now was noticing her shape. This was a new experience.&#x201c;Well, now,&#x201d; she said, smiling. &#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t realize that you wanted to be friendly. Just let me get your clothes off&#x2014;&#x201d;He dropped her. &#x201c;Just get out!&#x201d; he exclaimed, disgruntled.&#x201c;Forget it, junior. I found this place and it&#x2019;s mine.&#x201d;&#x201c;I <i>made</i> it and it&#x2019;s mine!&#x201d; he retorted.She arched an eyebrow. &#x201c;You made a beerbarrel tree?&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, not that, but I adapted it after it gave up its spirit. That&#x2019;s close enough.&#x201d;&#x201c;Well, I like it, but I don&#x2019;t like you, so I&#x2019;m going to get rid of you.&#x201d;&#x201c;No.&#x201d;She paused, studying him. &#x201c;Ah, that&#x2019;s your magic, isn&#x2019;t it! When you say &#x2018;no,&#x2019; you stop a creature from doing what she intends. That&#x2019;s why I&#x2019;m changing my mind, against my better judgment.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; His talent was not exactly magician class, but it served him in good stead when he needed it.&#x201c;So I&#x2019;d better not make any more threats because you&#x2019;ll just say no to them,&#x201d; she continued. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll bet it isn&#x2019;t all inclusive. You can&#x2019;t say &#x2018;no&#x2019; to the whole category of what I might try to do to get you out, but you can say it to each individual thing as I try it.&#x201d;&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d; She was catching on with dismaying rapidity. Obviously there was no ogre blood in her lineage.&#x201c;So I&#x2019;ll just have to find a way to make you want to leave,&#x201d; she concluded. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t hurt you directly, but you can&#x2019;t hurt me either, so we&#x2019;re even, for now.&#x201d;&#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d; he asked plaintively.&#x201c;Because it&#x2019;s getting too annoying back where I come from,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;The hummers, you know.&#x201d;&#x201c;The what?&#x201d;&#x201c;Never mind. Mortals can&#x2019;t hear them, generally. But they drive demons crazy. They&#x2019;ve gotten really bad recently, there in the Vale of the Vole, despite all we&#x2019;ve done to eradicate them. So I&#x2019;ve had enough; I&#x2019;ve moved to where I can be comfortable, after my fashion.&#x201d;&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re trying to take the place where <i>I</i> can be comfortable, after <i>my</i> fashion,&#x201d; he protested.&#x201c;So sue me.&#x201d;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s a mundane term. It means &#x2018;What are you going to do about it, stink-nose?&#x2019;&#x201d;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t understand. Is Sue a girl?&#x201d;She laughed, her whole torso jiggling. &#x201c;I suppose we&#x2019;re stuck here together, junior. Might as well make the best of it. Maybe we&#x2019;ll even get to like each other, though that may be stretching a point. Come, let me initiate you into the ways of demon sex.&#x201d; She advanced on him.&#x201c;No!&#x201d; he exclaimed.She stopped. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s that magic of yours again! I really wasn&#x2019;t going to hurt you, you know, this time. I can be very affectionate, when I pretend to be. Let me demonstrate.&#x201d;&#x201c;No.&#x201d; He was afraid of her now, as he had not been before, and ashamed for his fear. It wasn&#x2019;t because he thought she would use a pretext to get close to him and then try to choke him again; it was because he was afraid she would do exactly what she threatened, and that he would like it. He didn&#x2019;t trust a demon-stration.She eyed him speculatively. &#x201c;How old are you, Esk?&#x201d;&#x201c;Sixteen.&#x201d;&#x201c;And I&#x2019;m a hundred and sixteen, but who&#x2019;s counting? You&#x2019;re old enough, in mortal terms, and I&#x2019;m young enough, in immortal terms. Why don&#x2019;t you let me buy this den from you, and pay for it with experience? I can show you exactly what it&#x2019;s all about, so that you will never have to embarrass yourself by being clumsy with a mortal girl.&#x201d;Esk barged by her, dived out the door, and headed for home. Only when he was well away from the hideout did he ask himself why. Was he afraid that she would somehow lead him into some much worse embarrassment than he could guess? Or that he thought that w...</p><h2>Enough Rope</h2><p><p>Lawrence Block's novels win awards, grace bestseller lists, and get made into films.

She had a passion for the theater, James Joyce, and county fairs, and she could be quite persuasive when it came to those three passions. We would go on the Sunday in the third week of August, the closing night of the fair, when there would be a fireworks display. We would have a splendid time, she said. It was also her idea that we take her cousin Michael.<br><br>It was warm that Sunday night and the sky was clear and filled with stars. We sat in the front seat of the DeSoto and Rachel drove carefully along the dark asphalt country roads. Michael sat quietly between us, staring out of the windshield. A moment after we reached the highway he suddenly became quite talkative. He chatted about his frogs and salamanders. He talked about Andromeda, white dwarfs, and red giants. He seemed to know a great deal about astronomy. He had a high, thin voice and he spoke animatedly and in a rushing flow of technical words. I saw Rachel smiling. She wore a yellow sleeveless summer dress and her short auburn hair blew in the warm wind that came through the open windows of the car.<br><br>We came to a crossroads, bright with the neon life of a night highway, then went around a sharp curve. Set into the darkness about an eighth of a mile away, and looking as though it had carved itself into the night, was the county fair. Michael abruptly ceased talking and leaned forward in the seat.<br><br>The fair lay stretched out upon a huge field alongside the highway, bathed in a blaze of electric lights and neon signs, with strings of bulbs across an entrance arch spelling out the word PARKING, and floodlights poking bright fingers into the black sky, and blurred gashes of colored lights from a moving Ferris wheel and parachute jump. The brightness formed a pale, smoky, faintly pink arc-shaped cloud over the entire area, sealing it off from the darkness beyond. In the center of the field was a roller coaster with strings of lighted bulbs following its tortuous contour.<br><br>Rachel parked the car and we came out onto the graveled surface of the parking lot and to a chain-link fence with a gate. We went through the gate and into the county fair.<br><br>The three of us were standing on an asphalt road that was jammed with people. Teen-agers jostled roughly through the crowd, children ran about wildly, young and old couples moved along or stood near booths playing carnival games. A thick din choked the air. I heard gongs, bells, rifle shots from a nearby shooting gallery, the music of a calliope, the whooshing roar of the roller coaster, and a steady waterfall of human noise. It seemed as if all the noise of the world's wide night had descended upon this one stretch of lighted earth.<br><br>"We're in the wrong place," I said to Rachel.<br><br>She stood alongside me on the asphalt road, her face pale in the garish lights. Michael was staring around wide-eyed at the booths.<br><br>"What did you do, take a wrong turn somewhere?" I was annoyed and I let my voice show it.<br><br>"No, I did not take a wrong turn somewhere."<br><br>"'What happened to your county fair?"<br><br>"It was advertised as a fair. You saw the poster. Annual county fair. In big red letters. You saw it too."<br><br>"I don't like carnivals," I said.<br><br>"Neither do I."<br><br>"What do you want to do?"<br><br>She looked around indecisively, chewing her lip. I saw her glance at Michael, who stood nearby staring at the roller coaster.<br><br>"Why don't we call up James Joyce and find out what he would do?" I said, feeling irritated and annoyed and wanting to get away from the noise and the wildness.<br><br>She gave me an angry look. "Don't be nasty," she said. "It isn't my fault."<br><br>"What do you want to do?"<br><br>"We'll see the exhibits and go right home."<br><br>"They've probably got three cows and two horses in a tent somewhere."<br><br>"We'll look and go right home. So it won't be a total waste. What gall to advertise this as a fair."<br><br>We found the tent. There were cows, horses, calves, pigs, roosters, hens, awkward paintings by local artists, and some prize-winning home-baked pies. The wooden floor of the tent was covered with sawdust, and the smell of animal droppings was very strong.<br><br>"I'm thrilled," I said. "You have no idea how thrilled I am to see rural America at its creative best."<br><br>"Don't be mean," Rachel said. But she was as angry as I was.<br><br>"I'm not mean. I'm thrilled."<br><br>"I've seen beautiful fairs."<br><br>"Let's go home," I said.<br><br>Michael stood a few feet away from us, looking curiously at a prize calf. He wore a rumpled white sport shirt, tan shorts, and an old pair of tennis sneakers with the laces untied. He had wild dark-brown hair that badly needed trimming and dreamy blue eyes behind shell-rimmed glasses that were too large for his narrow face.<br><br>We came out of the tent onto the black asphalt road of the carnival. Michael wanted to know where the other exhibits were.<br><br>"That's all there is," I told him. "We just saw the whole fair. It's a carnival. They stuck some animals in and called it a fair. But it's a carnival."<br><br>"We're going home now," Rachel said.<br><br>Michael stared at her, his mouth dropping open.<br><br>"Reuven and I don't like carnivals," Rachel said.<br><br>But Michael did not want to go home. Why should we go home just because it was a carnival? he wanted to know. What was wrong with carnivals? He and Rachel stood on the road, arguing. It seemed to me they argued a long time. Michael had a strong, stubborn, aggressive streak. In the end, Rachel yielded.<br><br>We walked along the crowded asphalt road through the litter of pop bottles, ice-cream wrappers, soiled paper bags, popsicle sticks, beer cans, discarded newspapers. The carnival booths lined both sides of the road, and from inside the booths pitchmen shouted their games to the crowd. Some booths were large, with expensive-looking prizes on their shelves; most were small shanty-like affairs, with gambling games or tossing games operated by hard-voiced carnival people some of whom wore derbies or straw hats. The booths were on wheels and were scarred and blotched from travel. The carnival had been set up in the form of a circle, with the booths lining both sides of the curving asphalt road, and the Ferris wheel, parachute jump, and roller coaster in the center.<br><br>We approached a ring-toss game operated by a short, double-chinned pitchman in a straw hat. He was chewing on a dead cigar and shouting automatically at the crowd. He took off the straw hat and wiped his bald head with a red handkerchief. There was no one at his booth. He put the handkerchief away and saw me looking at him. His voice focused itself directly upon us, and we were drawn reluctantly to the booth.<br><br>We played the ring-toss game twice. Then we went to another booth and played a pitching game. Michael played awkwardly. His glasses kept slipping down the bridge of his nose and he kept pushing them back up with abrupt motions of his hand. After the pitching game Rachel told him again that she wanted to go home but he ignored her and went on ahead, moving restlessly along the asphalt road. He was a thin, narrow-shouldered, gawky boy, about five inches shorter than my own five feet ten inches, and he seemed all caught up in the tumult around us.<br><br>So we continued along the asphalt road, playing the games and ignoring the freak shows. Even Michael did not want to see the freak shows. We fired rifles at wooden ducks, threw pennies into flat plates, tossed baseballs at fat-nosed clowns. Rachel won a charm bracelet from the penny-tossing game, and Michael came away from the fat nose of a clown with a pen and pencil set which he stuck away in his shirt pocket with a triumphant grin. Now he wanted to go on the roller coaster, he said.<br><br>Rachel told him she did not like roller coasters.<br><br>"Then I'll go with Reuven," he said.<br><br>I told him I did not like roller coasters either.<br><br>"Then I'll go alone," he said, and started by himself toward the ticket booth.<br><br>Rachel looked at me helplessly.<br><br>"Your cousin is a first-class brat," I said. "Come on. We can't let him go up there by himself."<br><br>Michael grinned delightedly as he watched us purchase our tickets. We came through the turnstile and climbed into the front seat of a car. The remaining seats filled rapidly. The teen-age boy who had taken our tickets shouted something to the man behind the ticket counter and pushed down a long lever set near the tracks. There was a faint hum of machinery. The car moved forward. Michael sat to my left, talking excitedly about the last time he had been on a roller coaster years ago in Coney Island. He had been scared half to death, he said, grinning at me and pushing the glasses back up on the bridge of his nose. Rachel sat to my right, looking a little frightened. The car climbed slowly up a steep incline. Then we were at the crest and with a suddenness that pushed me back against the seat and took the air from my lungs we dropped wildly into the night.<br><br>The car hurtled downward on roaring wheels between lights that blurred into quivering lines. Michael held on tightly to the support rod, his body rigid, his teeth clenched. Rachel gave me a resigned look. We rose and fell and rose again and fell again. On the ground below, the carnival heaved and undulated like a garish blanket in a windstorm. There were screams and shouts from the other passengers and the fierce crescendo of racing steel wheels. Michael sat with his eyes narrow against the whipping of the wind and his mouth open as though gulping the air that beat against him. Then, with an abrupt motion, he stood up in the car.<br><br>Immediately Rachel shouted at him to sit down.<br><br>He stood there, holding tightly to the rod, his body swaying with the wild motions of the c...</p><h2>Geometry: A Teaching Textbook 2.0 Student Book and Answer Key</h2><p>Includes spiral bound text, teacher manual, CDs all in good condition with no writing or tears, used for one year only.</p><p></p><h2>All Aunt Hagar&#39;s Children</h2><p><p>In fourteen sweeping and sublime stories, five of which have been published in <em>The New Yorker</em>, the bestselling and Pulitzer Prize-winning author of <em>The Known World</em> shows that his grasp of the human condition is firmer than ever</p><p>Returning to the city that inspired his first prizewinning book, <em>Lost in the City</em>, Jones has filled this new collection with people who call Washington, D.C., home. Yet it is not the city's power brokers that most concern him but rather its ordinary citizens. <em>All Aunt Hagar's Children</em> turns an unflinching eye to the men, women, and children caught between the old ways of the South and the temptations that await them further north, people who in Jones's masterful hands, emerge as fully human and morally complex, whether they are country folk used to getting up with the chickens or people with centuries of education behind them. </p><p>In the title story, in which Jones employs the first-person rhythms of a classic detective story, a Korean War veteran investigates the death of a family friend whose sorry destiny seems inextricable from his mother's own violent Southern childhood. In "In the Blink of God's Eye" and "Tapestry" newly married couples leave behind the familiarity of rural life to pursue lives of urban promise only to be challenged and disappointed.</p><p>With the legacy of slavery just a stone's throw away and the future uncertain, Jones's cornucopia of characters will haunt readers for years to come.</p></p><p><p>Edward P.

His first collection of stories, <em>Lost in the City,</em> won the PEN/Hemingway Award and was short listed for the National Book Award.

He lives in Washington, D.C.</p>Peter Francis James's melodious baritone is beautifully suited to this fine collection of short stories by Edward P. Jones, who won a Pulitzer Prize for his earlier novel, THE KNOWN WORLD. The stories are predominantly about Southerners moving North to Washington, D.C., in the early and mid-twentieth century; although set relatively recently, they are replete with passages that seem as if they should begin "once upon a time." Accordingly, James speaks with a warmth and rhythm that invite listeners to settle back and listen. His pacing, particularly his use of telling pauses, is adept. And he shades characters with just enough personality to color the already-vivid scenes. A.C.S.

Lefthander Henry Wiggen, six feet three, a hundred ninety-five pounds, and the greatest pitcher going, grows to manhood in a righthanded world. From his small-town beginnings to the top of the game, Henry finds out how hard it is to please his coach, his girl, and the sports page&#x2014;and himself, too&#x2014;all at once. Written in Henry's own words, this exuberant, funny novel follows his eccentric course from bush league to the World Series.<p>Also available in Bison Book editions are <i>Bang the Drum Slowly</i>, <i>It Looked Like For Ever</i>, and <i>A Ticket for a Seamstitch</i>, the other three volumes in the Henry Wiggen series.</p></p><p>"First off I must tell you something about myself, Henry Wiggen, and where I was born and my folks." The opening sentence of the first installment of Harris's majestic quartet of baseball-centered novels may not be as imprinted on the literary consciousness as "Call me Ishmael," but the true aficionados of sporting belles-lettres deemed it, right from its 1953 publication, a quality start. They are the words that introduced both Wiggen, one of the true all-star characters of postwar American fiction, and the story-telling device that is his memoir. <p> Wiggen, a big, burly lefthander who grew up halfway between New York and Albany, pitches as much with his head as his arm, and he tends to be somewhat out of synch with everyone around him--parents, teammates, coaches, even his girlfriend; no one has a grip on him. The novel traces the arc of his life from the small town where he grew up to his thrashing around the bush leagues to the spotlight that's on him every time he takes the mound for the fabled, fictional New York Mammoths. Through Wiggen, Harris takes the pulse of postwar America; what he finds is sometimes funny, sometimes disturbing, sometimes poignant, and always absorbing. Like a good pitch, Harris hurls a classic novel with considerable pace, plenty of movement, and a knack for artfully catching life's corners instead of powering its way obviously right down the pipe. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>8 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Slow Sex: The Art and Craft of the Female Orgasm</h2><p>The truth is: Most women do not have satisfying sex lives.

Schoenbaum's <em>Shakespeare's Lives</em> first appeared over twenty years ago, critics enthusiastically hailed it as a triumph of wit and scholarship. Stanley Wells, the editor of Shakespeare's complete works, called it "an extraordinary achievement....fluent, vivid, and intelligent." Writing in the <em>Saturday Review</em>, Benjamin DeMott described <em>Shakespeare's Lives</em> as "a superbly informed, elegantly composed, intensely readable book," while Terry Eagleton remarked on its "shrewd intelligence." Schoenbaum's study of the changing images of Shakespeare throughout history broke important new ground; but in the years since this book first appeared many scholars have followed his lead, and Shakespeare studies has progressed by leaps and bounds. Now, Schoenbaum, one of "the heroes of Shakespeare scholarship," according to Wells, has revised and up-dated this classic study of Shakespeare and his biographers, taking account of the most recent scholarship, adding a chapter on "Recent Lives," and abridging certain sections. <br> Schoenbaum takes us on a tour of the countless myths and legends which have arisen to explain the great dramatist's life and work, bringing the story right up to 1989 with the publication of A.L. Rowse's <em>Discovering Shakespeare</em>. In the new edition, the emphasis is on more recent "lives" of Shakespeare, with information culled from such diverse sources as E.A.J. Honigmann's <em>Shakespeare: The "Lost Years"</em> and Richard Ellmann's <em>Oscar Wilde</em> (Wilde's <em>Portrait of Mr W.H.</em> advanced his theory of the Sonnets in fictional form). Besides fanciful theories such as Wilde's, Schoenbaum covers those who have used blatant forgery to construct an imaginary Shakespeare, such as W.H. Ireland and J.P. Collier (the latter would occasionally add his own verse to the Shakespeare canon), and those who have attempted elaborate argumentation to establish the identity of Shakespearean characters (A.L. Rowse claimed to have identified the elusive "Dark Lady" of the Sonnets). From Ben Jonson, whose celebratory verse opens the First Folio of Shakespeare's complete works (published seven years after his death), to Malcolm X, who denied the existence of a historical Shakespeare, <em>Shakespeare's</em> <em>Lives</em> considers virtually the entire legacy of idolatry, heresy, and speculation. <br> As before, Schoenbaum submits the documentary record of Shakespeare's life to careful consideration. Like a literary detective, he reconstructs as much of the elusive author's life as possible, considering his family history, his economic standing, and his reputation with his peers. The Shakespeare who emerges may not always be the familiar one (he was less vaunted by his contemporaries than we usually believe, for example), but all of Schoenbaum's claims are exquisitely documented.<br> Even in this revised and abridged version, Schoenbaum's narrative leaves hardly a stone unturned--from Samuel Johnson, Samuel Coleridge, and Alexander Pope to twentieth-century writers like James Joyce, E.K. Chambers, and Anthony Burgess (whose popular life of Shakespeare appeared the same year as the first edition of Schoenbaum's book). Curiousity about Shakespeare has not subsided since the original version of this classic appeared. This new edition will make the latest lives of Shakespeare available to a whole new generation of the Bard's fanatical followers.<br></p><p><br><em>About the Author:</em><br> <strong>S.

He then introduces a dozen other factors that can be combined with talent to achieve your goals: passion, initiative, focus, preparation, practice, perseverance, courage, teachability, character, relationships, responsibility and teamwork. Synthesizing the work of business gurus like Marcus Buckingham and Peter Drucker with inspiring anecdotes from the lives of famous athletes and coaches, Christian leaders, writers and artists, Maxwell engages the reader with his enthusiasm for his subject matter and clear insights. Well organized and focused, the book conveys how talent can be enhanced through historical and contemporary examples of "Talent-Plus" people in action&#x2014;from Charles Dickens to Vince Lombardi and Tom Hanks. <i>(Apr. 3)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Today, Dr. Steve Brusatte, one of the leading scientists of a new generation of dinosaur hunters, armed with cutting edge technology, is piecing together the complete story of how the dinosaurs ruled the earth for 150 million years. The world of the dinosaurs has fascinated on book and screen for decades - from early science fiction classics like The Lost World, to Godzilla terrorizing the streets of Tokyo, and the monsters of Jurassic Park. But what if we got it wrong? In The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs , top dinosaur expert Brusatte, tells the real story of how dinosaurs rose to dominate the planet. Using the fossil clues that have been gathered using state of the art technology, Brusatte follows these magnificent creatures from their beginnings in the Early Triassic period, through the Jurassic period to their final days in the Cretaceous and the legacy that they left behind. Along the way, Brusatte introduces us to modern day dinosaur hunters and gives an insight into what it&#39;s like to be a paleontologist. The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is full of thrilling accounts of some of his personal discoveries, including primitive human-sized tyrannosaurs, monstrous carnivores even larger than T. rex, and feathered raptor dinosaurs preserved in lava from China. At a time when Homo sapiens has existed for less than 200,000 years and we are already talking about planetary extinction, The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a timely reminder of what humans can learn from the magnificent creatures who ruled the earth before us.</p><p>Dr Steve Brusatte is a paleontologist on the faculty of the School of GeoSciences at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. He grew up in the Midwestern United States and has a BS in Geophysical Sciences from the University of Chicago, MSc in Palaeobiology from the University of Bristol (UK), and PhD in Earth and Environmental Sciences from Columbia University in New York. At age thirty-one, Steve is widely recognized as one of the leading paleontologists of his generation. He has written over one hundred peer-reviewed scientific papers during his decade of research in the field, named and described over ten new species of dinosaurs, and led groundbreaking studies on how dinosaurs rose to dominance and went extinct. One of his particular research interests is the evolutionary transition between dinosaurs and birds and he is a noted specialist on the anatomy, genealogy, and evolution of the carnivorous dinosaurs like Tyrannosaurus and Velociraptor.Excellent...a superb combination of good argument and good writing. -- Matt Ridley Full of adventures and humour. Abundant photographs and illustrations bring these stories to life * Science * Kind in tone and generous in description...[this] memoirlike writing is silly and lovable, making for one big adventure. * The Paris Review * He is a working scientist in the early stages of his career, so his tales have a freshness and an engaging immediacy that you don't get from the pens of scientists long past their productive years and with the leisure to write. Like Alexander Hamilton, he really does write as though he's running out of time, so one can excuse him if his style bubbles over into breathlessness. And best of all, he gives an extensive bibliography of semi-popular and scholarly sources, many of them so new that the ink is hardly dry. This is science at first hand, meant for grown-ups. -- Henry Geee * The Literary Review * A must-have for fans of ancient reptiles and their lost world. * Kirkus Reviews * [Brusatte's] captivating text explores the excitement associated with searching for and discovering new dinosaur species, provides clues to many long-standing questions associated with dinosaurs. . . a mix of memoir, chronicling Brusatte's personal odyssey from a child smitten by dinosaurs to a member of a vibrant scholarly community, and first-rate science writing for the general public. * Publishers Weekly * The ultimate dinosaur biography * Scientific American * This is scientific storytelling at its most visceral, striding with the beasts through their Triassic dawn, Jurassic dominance, and abrupt demise in the Cretaceous. * Nature * Fantastic . . . Superbly illustrated with photos and art, this is popular-science writing at its best. -- Nancy Bent With his new book The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs esteemed palaeontologist and author Steve Brusatte shows that the fun, fascinating and fact-filled story of the dinosaurs is still very much alive after 66 million years. Simply, a must read. -- Ben Garrod, BBC TV presenter As a scientist on the front lines of discovery, Brusatte delivers a cutting-edge account of Earth's most awe-inspiring age, and does so with great skill, humor and wonder. In his thrilling account of the revolutions and innovations that brought dinosaurs to rule the world for a near eternity, Brusatte captures both the majesty of the creatures he studies, as well as the breathtaking evolutionary ride that transformed these once scrawny also-rans into the myth-making tyrants of legend. It's the most epic chapter of earth history, and here it's told vividly by one of the world's top paleontologists. -- Peter Brannen, author of <i>The Ends of the World</i> Steve Brusatte's The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a triumph. Written by one of our young leaders of the field, he brings new discoveries, a taste for a good yarn, and his infectious enthusiasm to some of the epic tales of paleontology. It is hard to read Brusatte and not love lost worlds. -- Neil Shubin, author of <i>Your Inner Fish</i> The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a work of solid modern science, updating the fallacies and fancies of antiquated paleontology, revealing the quantum leaps in understanding of this modern science. But it is more than that. It is a personal quest full of enthusiasm and joy, getting beneath the dust to reveal the scales and the feathers of dinosaurs. -- Steve Backshall, Naturalist and BBC TV Presenter Steve Brusatte is doing some of the most exciting research on dinosaurs today, and he brings that excitement to The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs. Whether he's recounting remarkable fossil discoveries or explaining millions of years of evolutionary change, Brusatte shows just how much our understanding of dinosaurs has changed in just the past decade. -- Carl Zimmer, author of <i>Evolution: Making Sense of Life</i> An up-to-the-minute account of the long history and remarkable biology of the extraordinary animals that capture the imagination of every child. The dinosaurs are much more varied than the popular picture of lumbering giants and matching meat eaters. Steve Brusatte expertly leads the reader through the latest discoveries to unravel their great range of lifestyles in a vanished world. He explores the research that led to the realisation that dinosaurs Iive on - as birds. The book is an appropriate antidote to the hubris that puts our human species at the centre of the living world. -- Professor Richard Fortey A masterpiece of science writing * The Washington Post * A vibrant view of how dinosaurs originated and what happened to our Mesozoic favourites. Brusatte is as adept a scientific storyteller as any reader could ask for. * The Spectator * The Rise and Fall of the Dinosaurs is a lovely book. Brusatte has a wonderful knack for conjuring vivid worlds out of a few shards of petrified bone. He is excellent company as a narrator, steering a course between pedantry and patronising oversimplification with flair, and unafraid to guide the reader through some fairly complicated patches of science when he feels it is worth it. -- Oliver Moody * The Times * A gripping read in the best traditions of popular science -- Andrew Anthony * The Observer * Thrilling . . . the best book on the subject written for the general reader since the 1980s. -- Tom Holland * The Sunday Times *</p><h2>A New York Christmas: A Novel</h2><p>Anne Perry&#x2019;s new Christmas novel is an irresistible tale of love, betrayal, greed, murder, and selfless devotion.

Anne Perry lives in Scotland and Los Angeles.Jemima stood at the railing on the upper deck of the great ocean liner and gazed across the limitless sea. She had just turned twenty-three and was beginning what promised to be the first real adventure of her life.<br><br>It was December 1904, and she was crossing the Atlantic to New York, where she would stay for at least a month. Mr. Edward Cardew had invited her to travel as a companion to his daughter, Delphinia, who was to marry Brent Albright, the son of Rothwell Albright, Mr. Cardew&#x2019;s international business partner. It would be the society wedding of the year.<br><br>Phinnie had grown up in London, as Jemima had, but was only nineteen&#x2014;so it was not at all suitable that she travel alone. Mr. Cardew was an invalid and thus unable to make the journey himself. Someone older and wiser was needed, a person who could be both friend and chaperone. So Jemima had a passage to New York, and an invitation to stay with the Albrights. She had heard that New York was almost as big as London, both raw and sophisticated, a city bursting with life and the expectation of all kinds of new experiences.<br><br>If she allowed herself to, Jemima might envy Phinnie her coming marriage, with its promise of happiness shared. Phinnie had met Brent Albright when he visited England the previous year. Within a month she was wildly in love. &#x201c;He is handsome,&#x201d; she said, as she and Jemima sat together at afternoon tea. &#x201c;And a great deal more than that. He makes me laugh. He knows about so many things, and yet he is kind. I feel wonderful just thinking of him.&#x201d; She was too discreet to mention that he was also very rich, so would not have courted Phinnie merely for her prospects.<br><br>Jemima&#x2019;s prospects were different, although she had to admit that was largely her own fault&#x2014;or at least her own choice. Like her mother, Charlotte, she wanted adventure, interesting things to do, and, above all, love. She had no wish for a position in society. Perhaps, through tales here and there of her father&#x2019;s experiences and opinions, she had learned too much of its frailties, and she saw even the most powerful of men and the most elegant of women as no less vulnerable to the weaknesses of human nature than the footman or the parlor maid. Her father was Thomas Pitt, head of Special Branch in London. He had begun his career as an ordinary policeman, solving crimes that were often exceedingly grim. Her mother had sometimes helped him in that. Jemima could remember the excitement of it, and the heartbreak. Later, when he was head of Special Branch, his work became more concerned with official government secrets and was much more mysterious, at least to Jemima. That had not prevented Charlotte from participating, something Jemima had always admired about her mother.<br><br>In all the planning for this trip, no one had even mentioned Phinnie&#x2019;s mother. One allusion to her a few months ago had made Jemima think she had died when Phinnie was very young, not more than two or three years old. Nothing specific had been said, but the reference had been hurried past in such a manner that she felt it would be clumsy to speak of it again.<br><br>Phinnie must have missed her most of her life, but especially now. So Jemima was here to look after her, not only for the sake of propriety but also to be the friend and lookout her mother would have been. It was a trust she vowed to fulfill to the best of her ability. She would not let anything happen to Phinnie.<br><br>She smiled to herself, and turned away from the railing, and the wind. Twenty-three, and I&#x2019;m thinking like a policeman! You would be proud of me, Papa . . . and horrified!<br><br>Shaking her head, she pulled up the collar of her coat and walked back toward the gangway down to the huge vestibule and the many formal rooms of the liner. She was passed by an elderly woman in a magnificent winter dress. The woman looked her up and down briefly, then nodded an acknowledgment. &#x201c;Good afternoon, Miss Pitt,&#x201d; she said coolly.<br><br>Jemima was surprised that the woman knew her name, and not certain if that was a compliment or not. Then she realized it was actually Phinnie the woman knew. Jemima was merely &#x201c;the companion.&#x201d; That was not an entirely pleasant thought.<br><br>&#x201c;Good afternoon, Mrs. Weatherby,&#x201d; she replied, lifting her chin a trifle higher, and walking on without waiting to see if there would be a conversation.<br><br>She entered the cabin she and Phinnie shared, one of the more luxurious ones on the ship. It had both a bedroom and a quite comfortable-sized sitting room&#x2014;Phinne was there, curled up in one of the chairs. She was smaller than Jemima and just a trifle plumper, with large, dark eyes&#x2014;her best features&#x2014;and thick hair, almost black, with a natural curl that Jemima envied. Jemima&#x2019;s hair was a shining mahogany color, with gleams of amber she did not much like. And it had to be vigorously encouraged to have any curl at all.<br><br>Phinnie looked up as Jemima came in. She had just finished writing in her diary, and now she carefully closed it and snapped the tiny lock shut.<br><br>&#x201c;I shall want to remember this,&#x201d; she said with a smile. &#x201c;I shall not be a single woman much longer. I may forget what it feels like.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I shall remind you,&#x201d; Jemima replied, closing the door behind her and taking off her coat. She was glad to be in the warmth again. The wind off the ocean had a very sharp edge to it.<br><br>Phinnie gave a tiny shrug of one shoulder. &#x201c;Oh, you may not always be single,&#x201d; she said cheerfully. &#x201c;You really should turn your attention more fully to the subject. You do not need to be as fortunate as I am in order to be well suited.&#x201d;<br><br>A blistering retort rose to Jemima&#x2019;s lips, but she bit it back with difficulty. Phinnie&#x2019;s father was paying her fare, as she had been reminded twice already. She couldn&#x2019;t afford to alienate his daughter.<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed, you are quite right,&#x201d; she said, walking across to the cupboard where she would hang up her coat. She kept her back to Phinnie so the younger woman would not see the expression on her face. &#x201c;I would be content with far less,&#x201d; she added.<br><br>&#x201c;That is very wise,&#x201d; Phinnie observed approvingly. &#x201c;To know your own limits is halfway to happiness.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What is the other half?&#x201d; Jemima asked, hanging up her coat and turning round. &#x201c;Knowing your husband&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br><br>Phinnie was momentarily taken aback.<br><br>&#x201c;Perhaps it is knowing his limits but being careful not to tell him,&#x201d; Jemima said lightly. &#x201c;Tact is a priceless virtue. It can cover a multitude of misfortunes, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; Phinnie said instantly. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have a multitude of misfortunes.&#x201d;<br><br>Jemima smiled. &#x201c;Give it time. You are still very young.&#x201d;<br><br>Phinnie&#x2019;s smile vanished. Then with an effort she brought it back a trifle uncertainly. &#x201c;You say that as if you think something awful is going to happen.&#x201d; There was a tiny whisper of fear in her voice.<br><br>Jemima felt guilty. She was having a wonderful trip at Mr. Cardew&#x2019;s expense, no luxury withheld.<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; she answered. &#x201c;Nothing awful is going to happen.&#x201d; But she could not let it go entirely. &#x201c;However, you would do well to learn a little tact. You are not the only one with feelings.&#x201d;<br><br>Phinnie bit her lip. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry. I didn&#x2019;t mean to insult you. I know I&#x2019;m being selfish. I love Brent so much. I am incredibly fortunate that he loves me too.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will never please everybody; no one does,&#x201d; Jemima said more gently. &#x201c;And it&#x2019;s wonderful that you have Brent. But you also need friends, Phinnie. We all do.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not everyone likes you,&#x201d; Phinnie pointed out. &#x201c;You are very outspoken. Some people say you are opinionated.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Indeed? And do they mean it as a compliment?&#x201d; Jemima inquired with a slight edge to her voice.<br><br>&#x201c;No, of course they don&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then I am surprised that you wish to copy me,&#x201d; Jemima rejoined.<br><br>Phinnie drew in her breath sharply and could think of nothing with which to reply.<br><br>Jemima felt victorious, yet she had no pleasure in it. She went out of her way to be kinder to Phinnie that evening and listen to her without interrupting. She managed to sound impressed when Phinne was rambling on about the very considerable fortunes made by Albright and Cardew in their investments, and their climb from mere respectability to the pinnacle of power and influence in New York society.<br><br>&#x201c;Everyone is in awe them,&#x201d; Phinnie said with admiration. &#x201c;Brent says we shall carry on the family tradition in all kinds of ways. It will be marvelous, don&#x2019;t you think?&#x201d;<br><br>Suddenly Phinnie looked chagrined, as if she had just realized that she was speaking of opportunities Jemima did not have. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; she said humbly. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m being thoughtless again, aren&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; Jemima replied generously. &#x201c;In fact, I would love to hear about the charities they have endowed. I imagine you will one day guide some of these charities yourself.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you think so?&#x201d; Phinnie said eagerly, the warmth back in her eyes.<br><br>Jemima smiled. &#x201c;I have no doubt.&#x201d;<br><br>Phinnie looked down, a slight flush in her cheeks. &#x201c;As long as I please Brent, that&#x2019;s all I really care about.&#x201d;<br><br>That Jemima definitely envied her. She had met a considerable number of young men, and liked many of them well enough, but she had never really been in love. She had felt sparks, and excitement, but it had always been brief, and never accompanied by the deep liking that she had seen between her parents, the kind of friendship that strengthens with time and shared experience. She believed such friendship was the foundation of all the love that mattered.<br><br>Perhaps that was why she found it so difficult to meet someone she wished to marry. She could not settle for something that seemed far less than the love she had seen in her own family all her life.<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ll find someone,&#x201d; Phinnie said with sudden gentleness. &#x201c;I know it&#x2019;s taking rather long, but don&#x2019;t let that discourage you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Jemima promised, not because it was true but because she did not want to spoil Phinnie&#x2019;s happiness by selfishly indulging in her own feelings. What she meant, and intended to keep, was a promise to herself to look after Phinnie and make this adventure of hers as happy as it could possibly be.<br><br>Two days later the ship arrived in New York. From the deck of the liner, the city did not look so very different from London. But as soon as Jemima was ashore she heard the medley of different languages and saw Oriental faces and a good number of black ones, and others that were so fair, as if they were Scandinavian. Everyone was busy. There was an excitement, a tingle in the air, and she fully realized that she had come to a new place, even a new world, and, at least for the moment, alone.<br><br>It was overwhelming.<br><br>Phinnie clung to Jemima&#x2019;s arm as people eddied around them. Everyone else seemed to know where they were going.<br><br>Jemima felt a moment&#x2019;s panic. Then a slender brown-haired man was standing in front of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Miss Cardew, Miss Pitt? My name is Farrell. I have come to take you home.&#x201d;<br><br>He gave orders that their luggage should be brought and conveyed to the carriage that was waiting for them. Discreetly he passed coins to the porters, and their obedience was immediate.<br><br>&#x201c;If you will accompany me,&#x201d; he invited, &#x201c;we shall go and take our places in the carriage so we may return home, where Mr. Brent is eager to see you.&#x201d;<br><br>Phinnie&#x2019;s eyes were bright with anticipation, and her cheeks flushed.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes,&#x201d; she agreed. &#x201c;That would be very nice. It . . .&#x201d; She took a deep breath. &#x201c;It seems like ages since we last met.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Much too long,&#x201d; Mr. Farrell agreed. &#x201c;But then the Atlantic is very wide, as I am sure you are acutely aware at this moment. However, you are most welcome.&#x201d; He turned to Jemima. &#x201c;And you also, Miss Pitt. You will find New York a marvelous city, full of life and adventure, a meeting place for the world.&#x201d; He followed the porter across the open space of the wharf toward the way out, and the road.<br><br>&#x201c;Mr. Albright made sure that all the necessary paperwork was attended to,&#x201d; Farrell told them. &#x201c;You will have nothing to do but show it to the officials as we leave.&#x201d;<br><br>Phinnie smiled. &#x201c;I shall thank him. He is so very . . . thoughtful.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That would be Mr. Rothwell Albright,&#x201d; Farrell corrected her gently. &#x201c;He is a man of great influence here in New York. But there is no doubt you are already aware of that.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes.&#x201d; Phinnie nodded, covering her error easily. &#x201c;My father speaks of him often, and with the greatest regard.&#x201d;<br><br>Farrell took her arm to help her up the steps, but he did not reply.<br><br>Jemima followed after them. Farrell did turn a couple of times to make certain she was not struggling, but the way was easy enough.<br><br>The ride from the dockside to the center of Manhattan, where the Albrights had their residence, was so fascinating that Jemima felt no wish to speak at all. Once they were off the main thoroughfare, she saw lots of shop signs not only in foreign languages but in lettering she did not recognize: Russian, perhaps? Or Hebrew? Some were undoubtedly Chinese.<br><br>But it was the people who held her attention. At a glance they were much like those of London. She was interested and somewhat comforted to observe the same fashions. At least she would not look as much a foreigner as she felt.<br><br>On the narrow pavements groups of young men walked with a little swagger, an air of confidence. They looked around them, surveying their territory, as it were. Was it out of nervousness, or was it the arrogance of those who feel they have destiny in their grasp?<br><br>It was too late in the year for open carriages, but there were plenty of horse-drawn vehicles about, especially the wagons of tradesmen.

Pinned between the everglades and the swampy banks of Lake Okeechobee, the small town produces sugar cane . . . and the fastest runners in the country. Kids chase muck rabbits in the fields while the cane is being burned and harvested. Dodging flames and blades and breathing smoke, they run down the rabbits for three dollars a skin. And when they can do that, running a football is easy.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>But there are things in the swamp, roaming the cane at night, that cannot be explained, and they seem connected to sprawling mounds older than the swamps. Together with his step-second cousin "Cotton" Mack, the fastest boy on the muck, Charlie hunts secrets in the glades and on the muck flats where the cane grows secrets as old as the soft earth, secrets that haunted, tripped, and trapped the original native tribes, ensnared conquistadors, and buried runaway slaves. Secrets only the muck knows.</p><p>N. D. WILSON lives in Idaho with his wife and their five young explorers.Gr 5&#x2013;7&#x2014;Charlie's in foreign territory when his stepfather brings the family back to Taper, FL, to attend the funeral of his high school football coach. Charlie immediately finds himself adopted as a cousin by a relative of his stepfather and, almost as quickly, caught up in the strange customs and eldritch history of the football-obsessed towns that surround the sugarcane fields. Wilson has invented timeless creatures embodying good and evil. A mysterious and terrifying "Mother" reanimates the recent dead, turning them into "Gren"&#x2014;repellent, odiferous beings that pursue the boys through the muck, canals, and cane fields. The presence of Gren causes humans to think hateful thoughts. On the side of goodness, there's an odd, ghostly man wearing a helmet and wielding a rusty sword and Mother Wisdom, the football coach's widow who has magical healing powers. Additional layers of complications are provided by the appearance of Charlie's own father who'd abused Charlie and his mother before their divorce. There is also a half-brother Charlie never knew existed. Mixed in with the family drama and supernatural elements is some football. The atmosphere Wilson creates is darkly compelling, and the writing is poetic. The mythology, however, is more a net of allusions than a fully formed cosmology. Several references to Beowulf are made throughout the text, though how it directly relates to this contemporary story is unclear. Lyrical language, literary connections, and shifting points of view may leave the intended audience unwilling to wade through the muck with Charlie.&#x2014;Miriam Lang Budin, Chappaqua Library, NY</p><h2>The Highly Sensitive Person : How to Surivive and Thrive When the World Overwhelms You</h2><p>How to cope when the world overwhelms you. For those people who: have a keen imagination; are labelled too shy or too sensitive; who perform poorly when being observed even though they are usually competent; have vivid dreams; for whom time alone each day is essential; and find they are quickly overwhelmed by noise and confusion, crowded parties, hectic office life!!!!. this is the book to help them understand themselves and how best to cope in various situations. Highly sensitive people are often very bright and creative but many suffer from low self esteem. They are not &#39;neurotics&#39; as they have been labelled for so long. However, high sensitivity can lead them to cease to engage with the outside world. The book offers solutions for a happy and fulfilling life. Particularly in the way an HSP perceives his or herself: the book helps to &#39;reframe&#39; past events, such as a difficult childhood, or how they see themselves -- ie. shy. Particularly strong material for those raising a sensitive child</p><p>Are you an HSP? Are you easily overwhelmed by stimuli? Affected by other people's moods? Easily startled? Do you need to withdraw during busy times to a private, quiet place? Do you get nervous or shaky if someone is observing you or competing with you? HSP, shorthand for "highly sensitive person," describes 15 to 20 percent of the population. Being sensitive is a normal trait--nothing defective about it. But you may not realize that, because society rewards the outgoing personality and treats shyness and sensitivity as something to be overcome. According to author Elaine Aron (herself an HSP), sensitive people have the unusual ability to sense subtleties, spot or avoid errors, concentrate deeply, and delve deeply. This book helps HSPs to understand themselves and their sensitive trait and its impact on personal history, career, relationships, and inner life. The book offers advice for typical problems. For example, you learn strategies for coping with overarousal, overcoming social discomfort, being in love relationships, managing job challenges, and much more. The author covers a lot of material clearly, in an approachable style, using case studies, self-tests, and exercises to bring the information home. The book is essential for you if you are an HSP--you'll learn a lot about yourself. It's also useful for people in a relationship with an HSP. <i>--Joan Price</i>"This remarkable book...gives a fresh perspective, a sigh of relief, and a good sense of where we belong in society." <br>--John Gray, author of <i>Men Are from Mars, Women Are from Venus</i><p>"Elaine Aron's perceptive analysis of this fundamental dimension of human nature is must reading.

The scene reminds me of something, a memory maybe, but I can&#x2019;t recall what. I only know she looks beautiful and impossibly grown, and for reasons not clear to me I&#x2019;m possessed by an acute feeling of loss. </p> <p>It&#x2019;s the summer of 1998, a few days before my fiftieth birthday. Ann and I have been in Athens a whole twenty- seven hours, a good portion of which I&#x2019;ve spent lying awake in a room in the Hotel Grande Bretagne, waiting for blessed daylight. I tell myself the bereft feeling that washed over me means nothing&#x2014; I&#x2019;m jet- lagged, that&#x2019;s all. But that doesn&#x2019;t feel particularly convincing. </p> <p>I close my eyes and even in the tumult of the museum, where there seem to be ten tourists per square inch, I know the feeling is actually everything. It is the undisclosed reason I&#x2019;ve come to the other side of the world with my daughter. Because in a way which makes no sense, she seems lost to me now. Because she is grown and a stranger. And I miss her almost violently. </p> <p>Our trip to Greece began as a birthday present to myself and a college graduation gift to Ann. The extravagant idea popped into my head six months earlier as the realization of turning fifty set in and I felt for the first time the overtures of an ending. </p> <p>Those were the days I stood before the bathroom mirror examining new lines and sags around my eyes and mouth like a seismologist studying unstable tectonic plates. The days I dug through photo albums in search of images of my mother and grandmother at fifty, scrutinizing their faces and comparing them to my own. </p> <p>Surely I&#x2019;m above this sort of thing. I could not be one of those women who clings to the fa�ades of youth. I didn&#x2019;t understand why I was responding to the prospect of aging with such shallowness and dread, only that there had to be more to it than the etchings of time on my skin. Was I dabbling in the politics of vanity or did I obsess on my face to avoid my soul? Furthermore, whatever room I happened to be in seemed unnaturally overheated. During the nights I wandered in long, sleepless corridors. At forty- nine my body was engaged in vague, mutinous behaviors. </p> <p>These weren&#x2019;t the only hints that I was about to emigrate to a new universe. At the same time I was observing the goings- on in the mirror, I came down with an irrepressible need to leave my old geography&#x2014; a small town in upstate South Carolina where we&#x2019;d lived for twenty- two years&#x2014; and move to an unfamiliar landscape. I envisioned a place tucked away somewhere, quiet and untamed, near water, marsh grass, and tidal rhythms. In an act of boldness or recklessness, or some perfect combination thereof, my husband, Sandy, and I put our house on the market and moved to Charleston, where we subsisted in a minuscule one- bedroom apartment while searching for this magical and necessary place. I never said out loud that I thought it was mandatory for my soul and my creative life (how could I explain that?), but I assure you, I was thinking it. </p> <p>I felt like my writing had gone to seed. A strange fallowness had set in. I could not seem to write in the same way. I felt I&#x2019;d come to some conclusion in my creative life and now something new wanted to break through. I had crazy intimations about writing a novel, about which I knew more or less nothing. Frankly, the whole thing terrified me. </p> <p>After being crammed in the tiny apartment for so long I began to think we&#x2019;d lost our minds by tossing over our comfortable old life, I was driving alone one day when I took a wrong turn that led to a salt marsh. I stopped the car by a FOR SALE sign on an empty lot, climbed out and gazed at an expanse of waving spartina grass with a tidal creek curling through it. It was low tide. The mudflats glinted with oyster shells and egrets floated down to them like plumes of smoke. My heart tumbled wildly. I belong to this place. Perhaps living here, my creative life would crack open like one of those oyster shells. Or sweep in like the tides, brimming and amniotic. In those moments, the longing I felt to bring forth a new voice, some new substance in myself, almost knocked me down. </p> <p>I called Sandy. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m standing on the spot where we need to live.&#x201d; </p> <p>To his everlasting credit he did not say, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you think I need to see it first?&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;What do you mean you don&#x2019;t know the price?&#x201d; He heard the conviction and hunger in my words. After a pause, a fairly long one, he said, &#x201c;Well, okay, if we really need to.&#x201d; </p> <p>Later I went to the store and bought a red leather journal. I carried it, blank and unchristened, to the lot beside the salt marsh where we now planned to build our house. Construction hadn&#x2019;t started, wouldn&#x2019;t start for a few months. I sat on a faded beach towel beneath a palmetto palm and began making a list of 100 Things to Do Before I Die. It started off with a 10K race and riding a hot- air balloon over Tuscany. I didn&#x2019;t like running and really had no desire to travel by balloon. I turned the page. </p> <p>Finally, I began to write about becoming an older woman and the trepidation it stirred. The small, telling &#x201c;betrayals&#x201d; of my body. The stalled, eerie stillness in my writing, accompanied by an ache for some unlived destiny. I wrote about the raw, unsettled feelings coursing through me, the need to divest and relocate, the urge to radically simplify and distill life into a new, unknown meaning. And why, I asked myself, had I begun to think for the first time about my own mortality? Some days, the thought of dying gouged into my heart to the point I filled up with tears at the sight of the small, ordinary things I would miss. </p> <p>Finally, I wrote a series of questions: Is there an odyssey the female soul longs to make at the approach of fifty&#x2014; one that has been blurred and lost within a culture awesomely alienated from soul? If so, what sort of journey would that be? Where would it take me? </p> <p>The impulse to go to Greece emerged out of those questions. It seized me before I got back to the minuscule apartment. Greece. That would be the portal. I would make a pilgrimage in search of an initiation. </p> <p>A few days later, flipping through a small anthology, I stumbled upon four lines in May Sarton&#x2019;s poem &#x201c;When a Woman Feels Alone&#x201d;: </p> <p>Old Woman I meet you deep inside myself.<br> There in the rootbed of fertility,<br> World without end, as the legend tells it.<br> Under the words you are my silence. </p> <p>I read it a half- dozen times. I became entranced with the verse, which attached itself to the side of my heart something like a limpet on a rock. The image of the Old Woman haunted me&#x2014; this idea that there was an encounter that needed to take place at the &#x201c;rootbed&#x201d; of a new fertility. Who was this Old Woman who had to be met deep inside oneself? Sometimes I woke in the middle of the night thinking about her. About her dark fertility. About the silence beneath the words. </p> <p>When I made my first trip to Greece in 1993, I&#x2019;d inscribed a quotation on the first page of my travel diary&#x2014; words by theologian Richard Niebuhr: &#x201c;Pilgrims are poets who create by taking journeys.&#x201d; Recalling this, I recopied the words in the new red journal. What I wanted&#x2014; at least what I was trying hard to want&#x2014; was to create in myself a new poetry: the spiritual composition of the Old Woman, not through words, but through the wisdom of a journey. </p> <p>I imagined the trip as a pilgrimage for Ann, too. She had gone to Greece almost a year and a half ago on an academic trip and fallen in love with the place. Returning would be the graduation gift of gifts for her, but I also wondered if it might become an initiation for her as well. She was officially exiting the precincts of girlhood and stepping into young womanhood&#x2014; another threshold that wasn&#x2019;t all that defined and acknowledged&#x2014; and she did seem daunted lately. Not that we talked about it. When I inquired, she said she was fine. But on the flight over, during the hours she sat next to me, she stared out the oval window, at the SkyMall catalog, at the movie playing on the monitor over our heads, and there was an emission of sadness around her, like the faint dots and dashes of Morse code blinking secret distress. </p> <p>I realized it was conceivable that Ann and I both, in our own way, were experiencing a crisis, which according to its definition is: (1) a crucial stage or turning point, and (2) an unstable or precarious situation. At the very least, Ann was struggling to figure out the beginning of being a woman, and I, the beginning of the ending of it.</p> <br><br> <p>Now, though, I sit on the museum bench and consider this new epiphany, how surprising it is that for all these months I&#x2019;ve thought traveling to Greece was basically a pilgrimage about crossing borders into foreign regions of the soul. About meeting the Old Woman. I haven&#x2019;t considered it has anything to do with mothers and daughters. With Ann and me. With us. </p> <p>I watch Ann hone in with her telephoto lens on Persephone&#x2019;s face, the nose of which is partially missing. If you asked me to describe Ann, the first thing I would say is: smart. Her intelligence was never just scholastic, though; it has always had a creative, inventive bent. When other eight- year- olds were busy with lemonade stands, Ann set up a booth for dispensing &#x201c;Advice for People With Problems&#x201d;: minor problems cost a nickel; major ones, a dime. She made a killing. </p> <p>On the other hand, it must be said that Ann&#x2019;s defining quality is kindness. I don&#x2019;t mean politeness so much as tenderheartedness. Growing up, she railed against animal abuse and was unable to bear even the thought of a squashed bug, insisting we carry all insects from the house in dustpans. Indeed, whatever her sensitive and fiery heart attached itself to, she was passionate about it: bugs, dogs, horses, books, dolls, comic strips, Save- the- Earth, movies, Hello Kitty, Star Wars. </p> <p>The list of attachments revolved continually. Her constant testaments to these passions were the poems and stories she wrote throughout her childhood, filling one composition book after another. </p> <p>The only thing that seemed to curb her fervency was the other predominant thing about Ann&#x2014; her natural diffidence and the way it often veered off into self- consciousness. </p> <p>I wrap my arms across my abdomen and look away from her toward the room we just left, which like this one is a cluttered boneyard of sculptures and myths. I have the most absurd impulse to cry. </p> <p>I&#x2019;ve had intimations of this feeling of loss before, but it was a shadow passing in the peripheries, then gone. After Ann left home, I would wander into her room and catch the scent of dried prom corsages in the closet, or turn over an old photograph of our beagles and find myself staring at her handwriting&#x2014; Caesar and Brutus 1990&#x2014; or come upon her poem &#x201c;Ode to a Teddy Bear,&#x201d; or open a cookbook to her perfected horse head sketch in the margin, and I would feel it, the momentary eclipse. </p> <p>I tell myself it&#x2019;s natural for the feeling to surface now, with the two of us captive in each other&#x2019;s presence, brought together in a way we haven&#x2019;t experienced in . . . well, forever. Once, when Ann was twelve, we&#x2019;d traveled&#x2014; just the two of us&#x2014; to San Francisco, but that was hardly comparable to this. At twelve, Ann had not been away for four years during which time she transformed into a young woman I barely know. </p> <p>Her backpack is plopped open between her feet while she copies something from the sign beside the bas- relief into a blue spiral notebook. It has not escaped me that Demeter and Persephone have captured her attention. </p> <p>We have by this point tromped by a few thousand antiquities at least&#x2014; frescoes from Santorini, gold from Mycenae, bronzes from Attica, pottery from every nook and cranny of ancient Greece&#x2014; but this is the spot where I told Ann my feet are in abject misery and I need to take a break: before Demeter and Persephone. At the intersection of mothers and daughters. </p> <p>I wander over to the marble canvas and stare at the two robed women who face one another. Their myth is familiar to me. The maiden, Persephone, is picking flowers in a meadow when a 83100hole opens in the earth and up charges Hades, lord of the dead, who abducts Persephone into the underworld. Unable to find her daughter, Demeter, the great earth Goddess of grain, harvest, and fertility, lights a torch and scours the earth. After nine futile days of searching, Demeter is approached by Hecate, the quintessential old crone and Goddess of the crossroads and the dark moon, who explains that her daughter has been abducted. </p> <p>In a rage and too dejected to keep up her divine duties, Demeter lets the crops wither and the earth becomes a wasteland. She disguises herself as an old woman and travels to the town of Eleusis, where she sits beside a well in despair. Zeus tries to talk some sense into her. Hades will make a nice son- in- law, he says. She needs to lighten up and let the crops grow. Demeter will not budge. </p> <p>The earth becomes so desolate Zeus finally gives up and orders Persephone returned to her mother. As Persephone prepares to leave, however, she unwittingly swallows some pomegranate seeds, which ensures her return to the underworld for a third of each year. </p> <p>Mother and daughter are reunited on the first day of spring. Interestingly, Hecate shows up for the occasion, and the myth says from that point on, she precedes and follows Persephone wherever she goes. (A curious piece of the story that rarely gets noticed.) When Demeter learns about the fateful pomegranate, her joy is tempered, but she stops her mourning and allows the earth to flourish again. After all, her daughter is back. Not the same innocent girl who tripped through the meadow picking flowers, but a woman transfigured by her experience. </p> <p>Later, I would learn there&#x2019;s a name for this mother- daughter reunion. The Greeks call it heuresis. </p> <p>I dig through my travel tote for my map and unfold it across the bench. I find Eleusis, the ancient site of Demeter&#x2019;s temple, located just outside of Athens in what&#x2019;s described as an &#x201c;industrial area.&#x201d; Contemplating a visit before we leave Greece, I stuff the map back in my bag and wander off to find Ann, who has disappeared into the next wing. </p> <p>I want my daughter back. </p> <br><br> <p>I find Ann circling a tree rack of postcards in the museum gift shop, and notice she has plucked off a card depicting a statue of the Goddess Athena. </p> <p>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t she beautiful?&#x201d; she says, holding it out to me and digging in her purse for the drachmas we exchanged for dollars in the airport. </p> <p>A few moments later we step into the blare of sun and car horns and walk in silence, or possibly in stupefying shock at the heat, which was a hundred and five degrees when we left the hotel earlier. It&#x2019;s like slogging through pudding. Athens in high summer is not for the fainthearted, but I love how it spills into the streets, with sidewalk markets bulging with apricots, loquats, nectarines, and melons; the bougainvillea hanging in hot- pink awnings over the outdoor caf�s; the white apartment buildings etched with grapevines. </p> <p>We plod several blocks in search of a cab and are rescued on the corner of Voulis and Ermou. The taxi is an air- conditioned Mercedes- Benz. Ann and I fan ourselves in the backseat with museum maps. When we get out, I ask for the driver&#x2019;s card. </p> <p>Inside our room, we joke abou...</p></p><h2>The Magic of Krynn (DragonLance Tales, Book 1)</h2><p>Is Raistlin truly dead?<br><br>The answer lies in the new <b>Dragonlance </b>novella by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman, which gazes into the future of Caramon and his mage-son, and into the dark nether-past of Raistlin.<br><br>Untold tales of Krynn.<br><br>Tales of sea monsters, dark elves, ice bears, hideous hydra-headed serpents, and loathsome draconian troops.<br><br>Further adventures of the kender Tas; the innkeepr Otic and young Tika; the dwarf Flint and Tanis, leader of the companions; Caramon and Raistlin, twon brothers, one, a genial warrior, the other, a sickly magician and scholar.<br><br>Nine short stories by superlative writers, plus an exciting new novella by Margaret Weis and Tracy Hickman.<br><br>The <b>Dragonlance </b>Saga goes on!<br></p><p></p><h2>Gardener Looks at the Fruits of the Spirit</h2><p>Drawing together Christ&#39;s teaching in the parable of the sower, and Paul&#39;s passages on the gifts of the spirit, the author adds his own insights into God&#39;s creation to provide a guide to spirit-filled living.

Since the original publication in 1979, I have revised the book three times, with each revision about a decade apart: the ?rst in 1989, the second, 1999, and now a third, 2012 version. In each revision, my main purpose has been to incorporate instructional improvements that my group of teachers and I had gleaned from continuously teaching drawing over the intervening years, as well as bringing up-to-date ideas and information from education and neuroscience that relate to drawing. As you will see in this new version, much of the original material remains, as it has passed the test of time, while I continue to re?ne the lessons and clarify instructions. In addition, I make some new points about emergent right-brain signi?cance and the astonishing, relatively new science called neuroplasticity. I make a case for my life&#x2019;s goal, the possibility that public schools will once again teach drawing, not only as a civilized thing to do and a boon to happiness, but also as perceptual training for improving creative thinking.<br><br><b>The power of perception</b><br><br>Many of my readers have intuitively understood that this book is not only about learning to draw, and it is certainly not about Art with a capital A. The true subject is <i>perception</i>. Yes, the lessons have helped many people attain the basic ability to draw, and that is a main purpose of the book. But the larger underlying purpose was always to bring right hemisphere functions into focus and to teach readers how to <i>see</i> in new ways, with hopes that they would discover how to transfer perceptual skills to thinking and problem solving. In education, this is called &#x201c;transfer of learning,&#x201d; which has always been regarded as di?cult to teach, and often teachers, myself included, hope that it will just happen. Transfer of learning, however, is best accomplished by direct teaching, and therefore, in Chapter 11 of this revised edition, I encourage that transfer by including some direct instruction on how perceptual skills, learned through drawing, can be used for thinking and problem solving in other ?elds.<br><br>The book&#x2019;s drawing exercises are truly on a basic level, intended for a beginner in drawing. The course is designed for persons who cannot draw at all, who feel that they have no talent for drawing, and who believe that they probably can never learn to draw. Over the years, I have said many times that the lessons in this book are not on the level of art, but are rather more like learning how to read&#x2014;more like the ABCs of reading: learning the alphabet, phonics, syllabi?cation, vocabulary, and so on. And just as learning basic reading is a vitally important goal, because the skills of reading transfer to every other kind of learning, from math and science to philosophy and astronomy, I believe that in time learning to draw will emerge as an equally vital skill, one that provides equally transferrable powers of perception to guide and promote insight into the <i>meaning</i> of visual and verbal information. I will even go out on a limb and say that we mistakenly may have been putting all our educational eggs into one basket only, while shortchanging other truly valuable capabilities of the human brain, namely perception, intuition, imagination, and creativity. Perhaps Albert Einstein put it best: &#x201c;The intuitive mind is a sacred gift, and the rational mind is a faithful servant. We have created a society that honors the servant and has forgotten the gift.&#x201d;<br><br><b>The hidden content</b><br><br>About six months after publication of the original book in 1979, I had the odd experience of suddenly realizing that the book I thought I had written contained another content of which I was unaware. That hidden content was something I didn&#x2019;t know I knew: I had inadvertently de?ned the basic component skills of the global skill of drawing. I think part of the reason this content was hidden from me was the very nature of art education at the time, where beginning drawing classes focused on subject matter, such as &#x201c;Still Life Drawing,&#x201d; &#x201c;Landscape Drawing,&#x201d; or &#x201c;Figure Drawing,&#x201d; or on drawing mediums, such as charcoal, pencil, pen and ink, ink wash, or mixtures of mediums.<br><br>But my aim was di?erent: I needed to provide my readers with exercises that would cause a cognitive shift to the right hemisphere&#x2014;a shift similar to that caused by Upside-Down Drawing: &#x201c;tricking&#x201d; the dominant left hemisphere into dropping out of the task. I settled on ?ve subskills that seemed to have the same e?ect, but at the time, I thought that there must be other basic skills&#x2014;maybe dozens of them.<br><br>Then, months after the book had been published, in the midst of teaching a class, it hit me as an <i>aha</i>! that for learning to draw realistic images of observed subjects, the ?ve subskills were it&#x2014;there weren&#x2019;t more. I had inadvertently selected from the many aspects of drawing a few fundamental subskills that I thought might be closely aligned to the e?ect of Upside-Down Drawing. And the ?ve skills, I realized, were not drawing skills in the usual sense; they were rock-bottom, fundamental <i>seeing</i> skills: how to perceive edges, spaces, relationship, lights and shadows, and the <i>gestalt</i>. As with the ABCs of reading, these were the skills you had to have in order to draw any subject.<br><br>I was elated by this discovery. I discussed it at length with my colleagues and searched through old and new textbooks on drawing, but we did not ?nd any additional <i>fundamenta</i>l basic components of the global skill of basic realistic drawing&#x2014;drawing one&#x2019;s perceptions. With this discovery, it occurred to me that perhaps drawing could be quickly and easily taught and learned&#x2014; not strung out over years and years, as was the current practice in art schools. My aim suddenly became &#x201c;drawing for everyone,&#x201d; not just for artists in training. Clearly, the basic ability to draw does not necessarily lead to the &#x201c;?ne art&#x201d; found in museums and galleries any more than the basic ability to read and write inevitably leads to literary greatness and published works of literature. But learning to draw was something I knew was valued by children and adults. Thus, my discovery led me in new directions, resulting in a 1989 revision of <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</i>, in which I focused on explaining my insight and proposing that individuals who had never been able to draw could learn to draw well very rapidly.<br><br>Subsequently, my colleagues and I developed a five-day workshop of forty hours of teaching and learning (eight hours a day for ?ve days), which proved to be surprisingly e?ective: students acquired quite high-level basic drawing skills in that brief time, and gained all the information they needed to go on making progress in drawing. Since drawing perceived subjects is always the same task, always requiring the ?ve basic component skills, they could proceed to any subject matter, learn to use any or all drawing mediums, and take the skill as far as they wished. They could also apply their new visual skills to thinking. The parallels to learning to read were becoming obvious.<br><br>Over the next decade, from 1989 to 1999, the connection of perceptual skills to general thinking, problem solving, and creativity became a more central focus for me, especially after publication of my 1986 book, <i>Drawing on the Artist Within</i>. In this<br><br>book, I proposed a &#x201c;written&#x201d; language for the right hemisphere: the language of line, the expressive language of art itself. This idea of using drawing to <i>aid thinking</i> proved to be quite useful in a class on creativity that I developed for university students and in small corporate seminars on problem solving.<br><br>Then, in 1999, I again revised <i>Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain</i>, again incorporating what we had learned over the years of teaching the ?ve basic skills and re?ning the lessons. I especially focused on the skill of sighting (proportion and perspective), which is perhaps the most di?cult component skill to teach in words, because of its complexity and its reliance on students&#x2019; acceptance of paradox, always anathema to the logical, concept-bound left brain. In addition, I urged using perceptual skills to &#x201c;see&#x201d; problems.<br><br>Now, with this third revision in 2012, I want to clarify to the best of my ability the global nature of drawing and to link drawing&#x2019;s basic component skills to thinking in general and to creativity in particular. Throughout many cultures, both in the United States and worldwide, there is much talk of creativity and our need for innovation and invention. There are many suggestions to try this or try that. But the nitty-gritty of precisely how to become more creative is seriously lacking. Our education system seems bent on eliminating every last bit of creative perceptual training of the right side of the brain, while overemphasizing the skills best accomplished by the left side of the brain: memorizing dates, data, theorems, and events with the goal of passing standardized tests. Today we are not only testing and grading our children into the ground, but we are not teaching them how to see and understand the <i>deep meaning</i> of what they learn, or to perceive the connectedness of information about the world. It is indeed time to try something di?erent.<br><br>Fortunately, the tide seems to be turning, according to a recent news report. A small group of cognitive scientists at the University of California at Los Angeles is recommending they call &#x201c;perceptual learning&#x201d; as a remedy to our failing educational practices. They express hope that such training will transfer to other contexts, and they have had some success with achieving transfer. Discouragingly, however, the news report ended: &#x201c;In an education awash with computerized learning tools and pilot programs of all kinds, the future of such perceptual learning e?orts is far from certain. Scientists still don&#x2019;t know the best way to train perceptual intuition, or which speci?c principles it&#x2019;s best suited for. And such tools, if they are incorporated into curriculums in any real way, will be subject to the judgment of teachers.&#x201d;<br><br>I would like to suggest that we already have a best way to train perceptual skills: it has been staring us in the face for decades, and we haven&#x2019;t (or wouldn&#x2019;t, or couldn&#x2019;t) accept it. I think it is not a coincidence that as drawing and creative arts in general have steadily diminished in school curricula since the mid-twentieth century, the educational achievement of students in the United States has likewise diminished, to the point that we now rank behind Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, the Republic of Korea, Hong Kong, Sweden, the Netherlands, Hungary, and Slovenia.<br><br>In 1969, perceptual psychologist Rudolf Arnheim, one of the most widely read and respected scientists of the twentieth century, wrote:<br><br><i>&#x201c;The arts are neglected because they are based on perception, and perception is disdained because it is not assumed to involve thought. In fact, educators and administrators cannot justify giving the arts an important position in the curriculum unless they understand that the arts are the most powerful means of strengthening the perceptual component without which productive thinking is impossible in every ?eld </i> of academic study.<br><br><i>&#x201c;What is most needed is not more aesthetics or more esoteric manuals of art education but a convincing case made for visual thinking quite in general. Once we understand in theory, we might try to heal in practice the unwholesome split which cripples the training of reasoning power.&#x201d;</i><br><br>Drawing does indeed involve thought, and it is an e?ective and e?cient method for perceptual training. And perceptual knowledge can impact learning in all disciplines. We now know how to rapidly teach drawing. We know that learning to draw, like learning to read, is <i>not</i> dependent on something called &#x201c;talent,&#x201d; and that, given proper instruction, every person is able to learn the skill. Furthermore, given proper instruction, people can learn to <i>transfer</i> the basic perceptual components of drawing to other learning and to general thinking. And, as Michael Kimmelman said, learning to draw is a boon to happiness&#x2014;a panacea for the stultifying and uncreative drudgery of standardized testing that our schools have embraced.<br><br><b>Our two minds and modern multitasking</b><br><br>Today, as research expands and the information-processing styles and proclivities of the hemispheres become ever clearer, respected scientists are recognizing functional di?erences as evident and real, despite the fact that both hemispheres appear to be involved to a greater or lesser extent in every human activity. And there remains much uncertainty about the reason for the profound asymmetry of the human brain, which we seem to be aware of at the level of language. The expression &#x201c;I am of two minds about that&#x201d; clearly states our human situation. Our two minds, however, have not had an equal playing ?eld: until recently, language has dominated worldwide, especially in modern technological cultures like our own. Visual perception has been more or less taken for granted, with little requirement for special concern or education. Now, however, computer scientists who are trying to replicate human visual perception ?nd it extremely complicated and slow going. After decades of e?orts, scientists have ?nally achieved facial recognition by computers, but reading the meaning of changes in facial expression, accomplished instantly and e?ortlessly by the right hemisphere, will take much more time and work.<br><br>Meanwhile, visual images are everywhere, and visual and verbal information compete for attention. Constant multitasking linked to information overload is challenging the brain&#x2019;s ability to rapidly shift modes, or to simultaneously deal with both modes of input. The recent banning of texting while driving illustrates the problem of the brain&#x2019;s di?culty in simultaneously processing two modes of information. This recognition that we need to ?nd productive ways to use both modes perhaps explains why replicating right hemisphere processes is only now emerging as important and even, perhaps, critical.<br><br><b>A complication: the brain that studies itself</b><br><br>As a number of scientists have noted, research on the human brain is complicated by the fact that the brain is struggling to understand itself. This three-pound organ is perhaps the only bit of matter in the our universe&#x2014;at least as far as we know&#x2014;that observes and studies itself, wonders about itself, tries to analyze how it does what it does, and tries to maximize its capabilities. This paradoxical situation no doubt contributes to the deep mysteries that still remain despite rapidly expanding scienti?c knowledge. One of the most encouraging new discoveries that the human brain has made about itself is that it can physically change itself by changing its accustomed ways of thinking, by deliberately exposing itself to new ideas and routines, and by learning new skills. This discovery has led to a new category of neuroscientists, neuroplasticians, who use microelectrodes and brain scans to track complex brain maps of neuronal communication, and who have observed the brain revising its neuronal maps.<br><br><b>Brain plasticity: a new way to think about talent</b><br><br>This conception of a plastic brain, a brain that constantly changes with experience, that can reorganize and transmute and even develop new cells and new cell connections, is in direct contrast<br><br>to previous judgments ...</p><h2>National Audubon Society North American Birdfeeder Handbook: The Complete Guide to Attracting, Feeding, and Observing Birds in Your Yard</h2><p>Photographic portraits and descriptions of eighty commonly observed North American birds complement a detailed guide to creating a bird-friendly environment, with tips on feeders, nestboxes, birdbaths, recipes, and bird identification.</p><p></p><h2>Sounds of the Wild: Ocean (Pledger Sounds)</h2><p>Winner of a Parents' Choice Approved Award, this gorgeously illustrated pop-up book takes readers deep beneath the water&#x2019;s surface where they are greeted with a symphony of new sounds.

Does it disappear? Three decades ago, a young physicist named Stephen Hawking claimed it did-and in doing so put at risk everything we know about physics and the fundamental laws of the universe. Most scientists didn't recognize the import of Hawking's claims, but Leonard Susskind and Gerard t'Hooft realized the threat, and responded with a counterattack that changed the course of physics. THE BLACK HOLE WAR is the thrilling story of their united effort to reconcile Hawking's revolutionary theories of black holes with their own sense of reality-effort that would eventually result in Hawking admitting he was wrong, paying up, and Susskind and t'Hooft realizing that our world is a hologram projected from the outer boundaries of space.<br>A brilliant book about modern physics, quantum mechanics, the fate of stars and the deep mysteries of black holes, Leonard Susskind's account of the Black Hole War is mind-bending and exhilarating reading.</p><p>Leonard Susskind has been the Felix Bloch Professor in theoretical physics at Stanford University since 1978. The author of The Cosmic Landscape, he is a member of the National Academy of Science and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and recipient of numerous prizes including the science writing prize of the American Institute of Physics for his Scientific American article on black holes.From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by James Trefil What is it about black holes, anyway? To most scientists, a black hole is something like a duck-billed platypus in the sky: weird, unusual, esoteric and not all that connected to real life. On the other hand, people just can't seem to get enough of them. Any teacher will tell you that it's a whole lot easier to get a class interested in black holes than in DNA, even though the latter will most assuredly have a real impact on their future and the former will not. Oh well, if you must learn about black holes, you could do a lot worse than to pick up this engagingly written book. Stanford physicist Leonard Susskind provides a marvelous introduction to the subject that is both readable and easy to understand. Or at least as easy as something involving the two great 20th-century advances in science -- relativity and quantum mechanics -- can possibly be. You see, until the end of the 19th century, scientists who thought about the fundamental structure of the universe had concentrated on normal-sized objects moving at normal speeds (think billiard balls). We associate this kind of science with Isaac Newton. Then, in rapid succession, the 20th century brought two revolutions. The first, which dealt with objects moving near the speed of light or having very large mass, was relativity, the brainchild of Albert Einstein. The second revolution came when people starting thinking about very small objects, such as the stuff inside the atom. The resulting theory is called quantum mechanics and was developed by a small group of young scientists in the 1920s, the most familiar probably being Werner Heisenberg of uncertainty-principle fame. One note in passing: These revolutions didn't so much replace Newton as extend his reach. Like a tree, mature sciences grow by adding new material while leaving their heartwood intact. With increasing urgency over the past 50 years, theoretical physicists have tried to tie these two great 20th-century advances together, to produce what Nobel Laureate Steven Weinberg calls "The Final Theory." So far, we have not been successful. But if you can't bring the two fields together, you would at least like to know that they don't contradict each other, that they are mutually consistent. And this is where Susskind's "war to make the world safe for quantum mechanics" comes in, because for a period of almost 20 years, it looked as if there could well be a fundamental contradiction between the basic postulates underlying the two theories. At least that's what Stephen Hawking argued, and when Hawking talks, physicists listen. Remember that a black hole is an object so compact and so massive that nothing, not even light, can escape from it. It is, in fact, a kind of one-way gate in the universe: Stuff can fall in, but nothing can come out. Because it involves both a large mass and extremely high energy, the black hole forms a kind of nexus where both relativity and quantum mechanics come into play. Thus, if there are going to be problems joining these two fields, they are likely to turn up in the behavior of black holes. In 1983, Hawking proved that, against all expectations, black holes are not eternal. In fact, over unimaginably long spans of time, they evaporate, more or less like a puddle of water on a sunny day. And that's when the "war" started, because if a black hole evaporates (and everyone agrees that it will), what happens to all the information that was carried by the stuff that fell in? That information might include things like the mass of the particles that fell in, their spin, their identity and all kinds of other properties. Hawking argued that this information was lost forever, that the black hole was truly a one-way street to oblivion. The problem is that one of the basic laws of quantum mechanics is that information cannot be lost. (I should point out that in quantum mechanics the term "information" has a technical meaning, and that losing it is more of a problem than, say, losing the shopping list you need at the supermarket.) In the case of the evaporating puddle, for example, it is theoretically possible to reconstruct the puddle by looking at the air molecules above the spot where it used to be. Hawking argued, however, that with the material that evaporated from the black hole, no such thing is possible, that the information simply disappeared. Susskind's account of his reaction to this claim and of driving home from the conference where it was first presented, distractedly scribbling equations in the frost on his windshield, beautifully describes how disturbing the idea of disappearing information was to those of us steeped in the lore of the quantum. In the end, Susskind and his colleagues were able to resolve this dilemma and, in the words of the subtitle, "make the world safe for quantum mechanics." I won't spoil the book for you by telegraphing the ending. Suffice it to say that it involves a tour through the whole arcane menagerie of modern physics -- quarks, gluons, branes, strings. And this illustrates the main problem faced by authors of this sort of book. Black hole astrophysics is about as far from everyday experience as you can get, which means that the author has to spend a lot of time bringing the reader up to speed (indeed, it takes Susskind almost 200 pages). Even when, as in this book, there is virtually no mathematics, there is an overwhelming number of strange new concepts. Consequently, I recommend digesting this book in small segments, allowing each new concept to settle in before moving on. In the end, The Black Hole Wars is as good an introduction as you're going to find to the strange world of black hole astrophysics. Add that to the chance to ride along as real scientists resolve a fundamental issue and you have the makings of a great read. <br>Copyright 2008, The Washington Post.

Trusts benefit you. Period. Too often lawyers sell wills to clients only to sit back and wait to sell their probate services to their client&#x2019; s heirs. Modern estate planning should utilize the Living Trust as the effective, efficient, and inexpensive alternative to a will. <i>Living Trusts for Everyone: Why a Will is Not the Way to Avoid Probate, Protect Heirs, and Settle Estates</i>&nbsp;explains why wills are not the best way to handle an estate and details the many advantages trusts have over wills in not only eliminating probate, but protecting your assets for your heirs. Anyone with minor children, disabled beneficiaries, blended families, or spendthrift heirs must have a trust to be sure the assets left behind are put to good use, and that your intentions are carried out. Lawyers may have vested interests in perpetuating the probate system, but this book will explain why legal services are not needed to do the clerical work in settling a trust after death. No legal jargon or confusing double-speak, just specific step-by-step instructions and sample form letters to settle a trust are included to take the mystery out of the process. This is not a do-it-yourself book and it doesn&#x2019;t try to cram every type of trust onto its pages. <i>Living Trusts for Everyone</i> explains in specific terms what benefit a trust will have for you and gives you the tools to settle a loved one&#x2019;s trust with no lawyers and no expense. For those who already have a trust, there is a list of what to look for to see if your trust is any good, or if it needs to be updated. Trust seminars are examined with warnings on what to look out for in setting up your trust. Everyone who cares about what happens to their assets at death should read <i>Living Trusts for Everyone: Why a Will is Not the Way to Avoid Probate, Protect Heirs, and Settle Estates</i>!<br><br> Allworth Press, an imprint of Skyhorse Publishing, publishes a broad range of books on the visual and performing arts, with emphasis on the business of art.

Tour.</p><p>When Marta Sgubin joined Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis's household in 1969, she thought her job as companion to John Jr. and Caroline Kennedy temporary. Twenty-five years later, she was still with the family, as cook, household manager, and friend to "Madam," who urged Sgubin to compile her repertoire of simple but elegant dishes. Sgubin's <i>Cooking for Madam: Recipes and Reminiscences from the Home of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</i> presents nearly 100 of the family's favorite recipes plus dozens of never-published snapshots, most in color, of Mrs. Onassis, her family, and friends. Readers interested in an intimate glimpse of the Kennedy-Onassis household, as well as those seeking delicious, reliable dishes for everyday meals and for entertaining, will welcome Sgubin's book.<p> The recipes, arranged by seasonal menus and preceded by Sgubin's recollections, run the gamut from Oeufs Toupinal, a simple egg, ham, and potato dish that was served to Hillary Rodham Clinton on a tray, to the dressier Veal Stuffed with Morel Mousse, a dish Mrs. Onassis preferred without the sweetbreads it originally called for. Included also are a hearty shepherd's pie, a favorite of Diana Vreeland; Caroline's much-loved Chocolate Roll; and Floating Island, a John Jr. pick. The company dishes are outweighed by the informal fare, and most cooks will have no trouble preparing either. Sgubin's book succeeds as both cookbook and insider's tribute, showing us a remarkable personality through the food she enjoyed and the people she loved. <i>--Arthur Boehm</i></p>Marta Sgubin is still very much a part of the family, cooking festive meals for Caroline and Edwin Schlossberg and their three children.

After all, Josephus tells us firsthand about the Herodian family, the temple, the Pharisees, the Sadducees, and the Essenes. He mentions James the brother of Jesus, John the Baptist, and even Jesus himself. Arguably, apart from the New Testament itself, Josephus has helped us understand the life and times and world of Jesus and the apostles as much as any other document of the ancient world.<p>Unfortunately we have often strip-mined Josephus for selfish reasons and have left the message of this first-century Jewish historian in shambles. His relevance for Christianity has been flattened by a simplistic history=fact formula approach, and his contribution to our understanding of the ancient world has been twisted to suit modern needs and answer to questions Josephus never intended.</p><p>An internationally recognized authority on Josephus, Louis H. Feldman comments on the appearance of Steve Mason's <i>Josephus and the New Testament:</i></p><p>"There can be no doubt that the best aid for understanding the background of the New Testament is its contemporary, Josephus; and there can now be no doubt that the most careful, most comprehensive, and most useful introduction to Josephus as the key to the background for the New Testament is Steve Mason's book. As one reads it, one senses that a master teacher is talking directly to one in a most delightful, even breezy, style so easy to understand.

Earlier in this century, deep ideological cleavages divided the world's societies. Monarchy, fascism, liberal democracy, and communism were bitter competitors for political supremacy, while different countries chose the divergent economic paths of protectionism, corporatism, the free market, and socialist centralized planning. Today virtually all advanced countries have adopted, or are trying to adopt, liberal democratic political institutions, and a great number have simultaneously moved in the direction of market-oriented economies and integration into the global capitalist division of labor.<br><br>As I have argued elsewhere, this movement constitutes an "end of history," in the Marxist-Hegelian sense of History as a broad evolution of human societies advancing toward a final goal. As modern technology unfolds, it shapes national economies in a coherent fashion, interlocking them in a vast global economy The increasing complexity and information intensity of modern life at the same time renders centralized economic planning extremely difficult. The enormous prosperity created by technology-driven capitalism, in turn, serves as an incubator for a liberal regime of universal and equal rights, in which the struggle for recognition of human dignity culminates. While many countries have had trouble creating the institutions of democracy and free markets, and others, especially in parts of the former communist world, have slid backward into fascism or anarchy, the world's advanced countries have no alternative model of political and economic organization other than democratic capitalism to which they can aspire.<br><br>This convergence of institutions around the model of democratic capitalism, however, has not meant an end to society's challenges. Within a given institutional framework, societies can be richer or poorer, or have more or less satisfying social and spiritual lives. But a corollary to the convergence of institutions at the "end of history" is the widespread acknowledgment that in postindustrial societies, further improvements cannot be achieved through ambitious social engineering. We no longer have realistic hopes that we can create a "great society" through large government programs. The Clinton administration's difficulties in promoting health care reform in 1994 indicated that Americans remained skeptical about the workability of large-scale government management of an important sector of their economy. In Europe, almost no one argues that the continent's major concerns today, such as a high continuing rate of unemployment or immigration, can be fixed through expansion of the welfare state. If anything, the reform agenda consists of cutting back the welfare state to make European industry more competitive on a global basis. Even Keynesian deficit spending, once widely used by industrial democracies after the Great Depression to manage the business cycle, is today regarded by most economists as self-defeating in the long run. These days, the highest ambition of most governments in their macroeconomic policy is to do no harm, by ensuring a stable money supply and controlling large budget deficits.<br><br>Today, having abandoned the promise of social engineering, virtually all serious observers understand that liberal political and economic institutions depend on a healthy and dynamic civil society for their vitality. "Civil society" -- a complex welter of intermediate institutions, including businesses, voluntary associations, educational institutions, clubs, unions, media, charities, and churches -- builds, in turn, on the family, the primary instrument by which people are socialized into their culture and given the skills that allow them to live in broader society and through which the values and knowledge of that society are transmitted across the generations.<br><br>A strong and stable family structure and durable social institutions cannot be legislated into existence the way a government can create a central bank or an army. A thriving civil society depends on a people's habits, customs, and ethics -- attributes that can be shaped only indirectly through conscious political action and must otherwise be nourished through an increased awareness and respect for culture.<br><br>Beyond the boundaries of specific nations, this heightened significance of culture extends into the realms of the global economy and international order. Indeed, one of the ironies of the convergence of larger institutions since the end of the cold war is that people around the world are now even more conscious of the cultural differences that separate them. For example, over the past decade, Americans have become much more aware of the fact that Japan, an erstwhile member of the "free world" during the cold war, practices both democracy and capitalism according to a different set of cultural norms than does the United States. These differences have led to considerable friction at times, as when the members of a Japanese business network known as a <i>keiretsu</i> buy from one another rather than from a foreign company that might offer better price or quality. For their part, many Asians are troubled by certain aspects of American culture, such as its litigiousness and the readiness of Americans to insist upon their individual rights at the expense of the greater good. Increasingly, Asians point to superior aspects of their own cultural inheritance, such as deference to authority, emphasis on education, and family values, as sources of social vitality.<br><br>The increasing salience of culture in the global order is such that Samuel Huntington has argued that the world is moving into a period of "civilizational clash," in which the primary identification of people will not be ideological, as during the cold war, but cultural. Accordingly, conflict is likely to arise not among fascism, socialism, and democracy but among the world's major cultural groups: Western, Islamic, Confucian, Japanese, Hindu, and so on.<br><br>Huntington is clearly correct that cultural differences will loom larger from now on and that all societies will have to pay more attention to culture as they deal not only with internal problems but with the outside world. Where Huntington's argument is less convincing, however, is that cultural differences will necessarily be the source of conflict. On the contrary, the rivalry arising from the interaction of different cultures can frequently lead to creative change, and there are numerous cases of such cultural cross-stimulation. Japan's confrontation with Western culture after the arrival of Commodore Perry's "black ships" in 1853 paved the way for the Meiji Restoration and Japan's subsequent industrialization. In the past generation, techniques like lean manufacturing -- the process of eliminating buffers from the manufacturing process to facilitate feedback from the factory floor -- have made their way from Japan to the United States, to the latter's benefit. Whether the confrontation of cultures leads to conflict or to adaptation and progress, it is now vitally important to develop a deeper understanding of what makes these cultures distinctive and functional, since the issues surrounding international competition, political and economic, increasingly will be cast in cultural terms.<br><br>Perhaps the most crucial area of modern life in which culture exercises a direct influence on domestic well-being and international order is the economy. Although economic activity is inextricably linked with social and political life, there is a mistaken tendency, encouraged by contemporary economic discourse, to regard the economy as a facet of life with its own laws, separate from the rest of society. Seen this way, the economy is a realm in which individuals come together only to satisfy their selfish needs and desires before retreating back into their "real" social lives. But in any modern society, the economy constitutes one of the most fundamental and dynamic arenas of human sociability. There is scarcely any form of economic activity, from running a dry-cleaning business to fabricating large-scale integrated circuits, that does not require the social collaboration of human beings. And while people work in organizations to satisfy their individual needs, the workplace also draws people out of their private lives and connects them to a wider social world. That connectedness is not just a means to the end of earning a paycheck but an important end of human life itself. For just as people are selfish, a side of the human personality craves being part of larger communities. Human beings feel an acute sense of unease -- what Emile Durkheim labeled <i>anomie</i> -- in the absence of norms and rules binding them to others, an unease that the modern workplace serves to moderate and overcome.<br><br>The satisfaction we derive from being connected to others in the workplace grows out of a fundamental human desire for recognition. As I argued in <i>The End of History and the Last Man,</i> every human being seeks to have his or her dignity recognized (i.e., evaluated at its proper worth) by other human beings. Indeed, this drive is so deep and fundamental that it is one of the chief motors of the entire human historical process. In earlier periods, this desire for recognition played itself out in the military arena as kings and princes fought bloody battles with one another for primacy. In modern times, this struggle for recognition has shifted from the military to the economic realm, where it has the socially beneficial effect of creating rather than destroying wealth. Beyond subsistence levels, economic activity is frequently undertaken for the sake of recognition rather than merely as a means of satisfying natural material needs. The latter are, as Adam Smith pointed out, few in number and relatively easily satisfied. Work and money are much more important as sources of identity, status, and dignity, whether one has created a multinational media empire or been promoted to foreman. This kind of recognition cannot be achieved by individuals; it can come about only in a social context.<br><br>Thus, economic activity represents a crucial part of social life and is knit together by a wide variety of norms, rules, moral obligations, and other habits that together shape the society. As this book will show, one of the most important lessons we can learn from an examination of economic life is that a nation's well-being, as well as its ability to compete, is conditioned by a single, pervasive cultural characteristic: the level of trust inherent in the society.<br><br>Consider the following vignettes from twentieth-century economic life:<br><br>* During the oil crisis of the early 1970s, two automakers on opposite sides of the world, Mazda and Daimler-Benz (maker of Mercedes-Benz luxury cars), were both hit with declining sales and the prospect of bankruptcy. In both cases, they were bailed out by a coalition of companies with which they had traditionally done business, led by a large bank: Sumitomo Trust, in the instances of Mazda, and the Deutsche Bank, in the case of Daimler. In both cases, immediate profitability was sacrificed for the sake of saving the institution -- in the German case, to prevent it from being bought out by a group of Arab investors.<br><br>* The recession of 1983-1984 that ravaged America's industrial heartland also hit the Nucor Corporation very hard. Nucor had just entered the steelmaking business by building mini-mills using a new German continuous-casting technology. Its mills were built in places like Crawfordsville, Indiana, outside the traditional rust belt, and were operated by nonunionized workers, many of them former farmers. To deal with the drop in revenues, Nucor put its employees -- from the CEO to the lowliest maintenance worker -- on a two- or three-day workweek, with a corresponding cut in pay. No workers were fired, however, and when the economy and the company recovered, it enjoyed a tremendous esprit de corps that contributed to its becoming a major force in the American steel industry.<br><br>* In the Toyota Motor Company's Takaoka assembly plant, any of the thousands of assembly line workers who work there can bring the entire plant to a halt by pulling on a cord at his or her workstation. They seldom do. By contrast, workers at the great Ford auto plants like Highland Park or River Rouge -- plants that virtually defined the nature of modern industrial production for three generations -- were never trusted with this kind of power. Today, Ford workers, having adopted Japanese techniques, are trusted with similar powers, and have greater control over their workplace and machines.<br><br>* In Germany, shop foremen on the floor of a typical factory know how to do the jobs of those who work under them and frequently take their place if the need arises. The foreman can move workers from one job to another and evaluates them based on face-to-face dealings. There is great flexibility in promotion: a blue-collar worker can obtain credentials as an engineer by attending an extensive in-company training program rather than going to a university.<br><br>The common thread that runs through these four apparently unrelated vignettes is that in each case, economic actors supported one another because they believed that they formed a community based on mutual trust. The banks and suppliers that engineered the Mazda and Daimler-Benz rescues felt an obligation to support these auto companies because the latter had supported them in the past and would do so again in the future. In the German case, moreover, there was a nationalistic feeling that such an important trademark German name as Mercedes-Benz should not fall into non-German hands. Workers at Nucor were willing to accept severe cuts in their weekly pay because they believed that the managers who devised the pay cut plan were hurting as well and were committed to not laying them off. The workers at the Toyota plant were given immense power to stop the entire assembly line because management trusted them not to abuse that power, and they repaid this trust by using that power responsibly to improve the line's overall productivity. Finally, the workplace in Germany is flexible and egalitarian because workers trust their managers and fellow workers to a higher degree than in other European countries.<br><br>The community in each of these cases was a cultural one, formed not on the basis of explicit rules and regulations but out of a set of ethical habits and reciprocal moral obligations internalized by each of the community's members. These rules or habits gave members of the community grounds for trusting one another. Decisions to support the community were not based on narrow economic self-interest. The Nucor management could have decided to award themselves bonuses while laying off workers, as many other American corporations did at the time, and Sumitomo Trust and Deutsche Bank could perhaps have maximized their profits by selling off their failing assets. Solidarity within the economic community in question may have had beneficial consequences over the long run for the bottom line; certainly Nucor's workers were motivated to give their company an extra measure of effort once the recession was over, as was the German foreman whose company helped him to become an engineer. But the reason that these economic actors behaved as they did was not necessarily because they had calculated these economic consequences in advance; rather, solidarity within their economic community had become an end in itself. Each was motivated, in other words, by something broader than individual self-interest.

By eating the plants and animals of our earth, we literally incorporate them. It is also through this act of eating that we partake of our culture&#x2019;s values and paradigms at the most primal levels. It is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that the choices we make about our food are leading to environmental degradation, enormous human health problems, and unimaginable cruelty toward our fellow creatures.<br><br>Incorporating systems theory, teachings from mythology and religions, and the human sciences, The World Peace Diet presents the outlines of a more empowering understanding of our world, based on a comprehension of the far-reaching implications of our food choices and the worldview those choices reflect and mandate. The author offers a set of universal principles for all people of conscience, from any religious tradition, that they can follow to reconnect with what we are eating, what was required to get it on our plate, and what happens after it leaves our plates.<br><br>The World Peace Diet suggests how we as a species might move our consciousness forward so that we can be more free, more intelligent, more loving, and happier in the choices we make.</p><p>Will Tuttle has a master&#x2019;s degree in humanities from San Francisco State University and a Ph.D. in the philosophy of education from the University of California. A professional pianist and teacher, he has for the last thirteen years toured progressive churches, vegetarian and macrobiotic conferences, and intentional communities throughout the country. He trained in Korea as a Zen Buddhist monk and has worked extensively in Tai Chi, yoga, massage, and dance and movement. He lives in Healdsburg, California.Reviewed by Susan B. Hagloch<br><br>Not a diet book in the usual sense of the term, this is "an exploration intothe profound cultural and spiritual ramifications of our food choices."Tuttle, who trained with a Zen Buddhist monk and speaks widely on spiritualhealing, posits that our ancient herding cultures and the resultantinclusion of animals and animal products into our modern diets havedesensitized us to the suffering of our fellow creatures; this, in turn,allows us to accept violence against other humans. At his most logical,Tuttle backs up his claims with examples of mainstream spiritual traditionsand philosophers' arguments. He is less persuasive when he descends intohorrific sensationalism-less talk of the rape of cows via artificialinsemination and more illustrations of how soy products can be substitutedinto our daily menus would have made this a better book. While not alwayslevelheaded, this book is certainly thought-provoking. Given the increasingpopularity of vegetarianism and veganism, this is recommended for mostcollections. (2006-05-02)<br><br>Reviewed by Charles Patterson<br><br><strong>The World Peace Diet</strong> is a unique contribution to understanding the direct relationship between the food we eat and the vast range of the world&#x2019;s problems&#x2015;hunger, poverty, disease, war, terrorism, genocide, environmental degradation, and, of course, the exploitation and slaughter of billions of defenseless animals, which all too many people do not consider a problem at all. <br><br>To explain how the ugly reality of the abuse and killing of animals became the centerpiece of our so-called civilization, Dr. Will Tuttle examines the emergence of our herding culture that began roughly 10,000 years ago in the Near East with the enslavement (euphemistically called &#x201c;domestication&#x201d;) of sheep and goats, and later cattle, camels, horses, and other animals for food, clothing, transport and labor. <br><br>This herding culture introduced a higher level of domination and coercion into human history and eventually led to oppressive hierarchical societies and large-scale warfare never seen before. The enslavement of animals and the intensive animal agriculture that resulted from it injected large doses of ruthlessness, detachment, and socially accepted cruelty into the fabric of our civilization. It also produced assorted ideologies of human supremacy and speciesist attitudes that today define our relationship to animals. <br><br>Tuttle examines in detail the horrors of modern industrialized animal agriculture&#x2015;factory farms, slaughterhouses, hunting and herding sea life, the devastating effects on human health and the environment, and the corporate meat-medical complex behind it all. In a chapter called &#x201c;The Domination of the Feminine&#x201d; he describes the &#x201c;dairy nightmare&#x201d; and the &#x201c;four pathways to hell&#x201d; for calves born to dairy cows. He also writes about the egg industry as another manifestation of our patriarchal herding culture&#x2019;s domination of the feminine.<br><br>Failure to see, confront, and take responsibility for the vast hidden suffering that our food choices require shrivels us up as human beings emotionally, intellectually, and spiritually and keeps our society in a perpetual state of denial and hypocrisy. Keeping ourselves oblivious to what we&#x2019;re doing when we purchase, prepare, and consume meat, eggs, and dairy products truncates our capacity to think, feel, and care for others. <br><br>According to Tuttle, the desensitizing of millions of children and adults to the daily torture of animals plants in them the seeds of violence, poverty, war, genocide, and despair. The cycles of violence that have terrorized and continue to terrorize people are rooted in our meals. Eating animals forces us to act like predators, and we then proceed to see and define ourselves as such. The cruelty we are forced to participate in as children turns us into lifetime perpetrators of cruelty. How can we be peaceful and compassionate people while eating the flesh of abused animals?<br><br>Growing up, none of us freely chose to eat animals. Our family and culture imposed it on us. Well-meaning parents, grandparents, and others force us to eat the flesh and secretions of animals long before we have any choice in the matter. By the time we find out that the meat on our plate is the flesh of a murdered animal, it all seems natural and normal. By then our daily meals are already rituals of denial and repressed guilt that dull our innate compassion and our propensity for justice.<br><br>The conspiracy of silence about the truth of our meals is so pervasive that there is a strong societal taboo against knowing where our food comes from. Exploiting and killing animals is such an accepted part of our way of life that it is unmentionable in public and is virtually ignored in discussions and debates about social problems and public policy. It never seems to occur to those our society considers its leaders that the best way to curb violence is to get people to stop eating violence.<br><br>Late in the book the author tells the story of his own journey to veganism. While living in Concord, Massachusetts, for the first 22 years of his life, Tuttle, like most Americans, ate large quantities of animal flesh, eggs, and dairy products. However, during that time he also encountered seeds of inspiration that sprouted later: the literary revolution of the 1840s and &#x2018;50s, based in Concord, that sprang from the lives and writings of American transcendentalists like Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Nathaniel Hawthorne, and Louisa May Alcott. <br><br>Tuttle points out that they were the first major American thinkers to question the meaning of food and establish a philosophical foundation for a more compassionate attitude toward animals. Thoreau thought the destiny of the human race should be &#x201c;to leave off eating animals as surely as the savage tribes have left off eating each other,&#x201d; and Louisa May Alcott wrote, &#x201c;Vegetable diet and sweet repose. Animal food and nightmare... Without flesh diet there could be no blood-shedding war.&#x201d;<br><br>Tuttle&#x2019;s commitment and dedication to his vegan, nonviolent worldview suffuses every page of this profoundly insightful and important book. <strong>The World Peace Diet</strong> is sure to be a catalyst and powerful tool in the evolution of human consciousness, from our present herder mindset&#x2015;based on might-makes-right and the exploitation of others&#x2015;to a more humane attitude toward the earth and all its inhabitants. (2006-05-02)<br><br>Reviewed by Eve Spencer<br><br>Apart from the author&#x2019;s master&#x2019;s degree in humanities and PhD in the philosophy of education, he is also a professional pianist who trained in Korea as a Zen Buddhist monk, worked in tai chi, yoga, meditation, intuition development and spiritual healing, and lives a vegan lifestyle.<br><br><strong>The World Peace Diet</strong> is not a diet in the sense of a fad diet to lose weight, but the author illustrates clearly how the social, psychological and spiritual consequences of our meals &#x201c;ripple through all aspects of our lives.&#x201d;<br><br>The book is systematically developed to reveal the connection between what we daily put on our plates, and peace in the world and in our lives. Some of the chapters covered include the power of food, the herding culture, the nature of intelligence, domination of the feminine, the metaphysics of food, science and religion, profiting from destruction, the journey of transformation, and in the final chapter&#x2015;living the revolution&#x2015;is &#x201c;the last days of eating animal.&#x201d;<br><br>Many people we talk with about food insist that we all make individual choices about the foods we eat, resisting being told that we are indoctrinated. But as Tuttle points out, we never chose an omnivorous diet; we were fed this way by our herding culture. We were told by our parents, doctors, church leaders, teachers, as well as by government, advertising and the media, the meat, dairy and egg businesses, and big pharma, as well as most nutritionists, that nonhuman animals are there for us to eat and make us strong. Those forces continue to manipulate consumers who still believe they are making free choices, while the terror and suffering of other animals remain hidden from view. If we could only look with enlightened eyes at the meat on our plates, and see beyond the appearance, we would surely shrink, horrified. Are we not aware of the interdependence of consciousness, energy and matter? Pythagoras taught, many years ago, that eating animal foods has negative effects on our consciousness. The toxins such as trans fats, pathogens, pesticides, and drug and hormone residues that are present in animal foods, besides injuring the animals, also injure our bodies, and can also disturb us emotionally. When humans eat the flesh of beings who have endured fear, terror and agony, their sufferings are literally ingested into our bodies. How then can we live with inner peace? <br><br>As the author points out, calves, steers, lambs, chickens and even dairy cows, who would easily live 20 to 30 years in the wild, are all pushed to grow abnormally quickly, then slaughtered as infants and children. Similarly in the various wars around the globe, children suffer and die the most. The eggs, bacon and cheese that we eat are living vibratory embodiments of cruelty, violence, enslavement, terror and despair&#x2015;the tormented consciousness of the animals. <br><br>Dr Tuttle reminds us that we talk about stopping the cycle of violence; children who are violated and abused will often, when they become adults, tend to perpetuate the cycle of violence through the generations. We can see this; yet fail to see the deeper dynamic. We will always be violent towards each other as long as we are violent towards other animals&#x2015;how can it be otherwise?<br><br><strong>The World Peace Diet</strong> portrays how a vegan life offers compassion for all beings, including for ourselves and for the planet. The author reveals how such a revolution of heart, mind and body can enable us to transform our world to one of peace, harmony, loving kindness, respect and reverence for the interconnectedness and sacredness of all life. For anyone wanting to grow spiritually, who wants to wake up and live a compassionate life, and contribute to world peace, this book will help. How rare to come across a book that clearly depicts the problems arising from a meat-based diet entirely cut off from the spiritual aspects of our lives.<br><br>I cannot do justice to this wonderful book&#x2015;you have to read every page for yourself, and I thoroughly recommend that you do. (2006-05-02)<br><br>Reviewed by Joseph Connelly, March/ April 2006<br><br>[excerpted]<br>Tuttle's scholarship calls for a new revolution to counter what he sees as our culture's last true upheaval, the commodification of animals, which "completely redefined human relations with animals, nature, the divine, and each other." Tuttle doesn't hold back:<blockquote>To meditate for world peace, to pray for a better world, and to work for social justice and environmental protection while continuing to purchase the flesh, milk, and eggs of horribly abused animals exposes a disconnect that is so fundamental that it renders our efforts absurd, hypocritical, and doomed to a certain failure.</blockquote>Tuttle lifts the discussion of veganism to a higher level. He argues cogently for a spiritual component, one where the consequence of using and consuming animals, so ubiquitous in human society, affects us not only in ways that can be measured physically, but physically aas well. He convincingly shows how science and patriarchical religions, so often at odds in Western Society, are both cut from the same cloth&#x2015;one that reinforces the domination of women, animals and nature in order to further the interests of the ruling elite. Yet for all of the complexities of how we ended up where we are, Tuttle&#x2019;s remedy of spiritual veganism is offered as the cure for what ails us.<blockquote>When we cultivate ... the consequences of our food choices and conscientiously adopt a plant-based way of eating, refusing to participate in the domination of animals and the dulling of the awareness this requires, we make a profound statement... We become a force of sensitivity, healing, and compassion. We become a revolution of one. </blockquote> The revolution starts now.

Author Will Tuttle, who has received a Ph.D. in the philosophy of education from the University of California, Berkeley, examines the deleterious medical, hormonal, environmental, and societal effects of consuming meat or other animal products such as milk or eggs. Forcefully recommending a change toward the higher consciousness and compassion for animals and humans alike that is veganism, <strong>The World Peace Diet</strong> is passionate in its denouncement of myths perpetuated by the meat, milk and egg industry and its endorsement of the health and spiritual benefits that encompass making a change toward a cruelty-free diet. (2006-02-13)<br><br>An outline for understanding the far&#x2013;reaching implications of our food choices. Will offers a set of universal principles for all people of conscience that shows how we can move our consciousness forward.<br><br>Food is our most intimate and telling connection both with the living natural order and with our living cultural heritage. By eating the plants and animals of our earth, we literally incorporate them. It is also through this act of eating that we partake of our culture&#x2019;s values and paradigms at the most primal levels. It is becoming increasingly obvious, however, that the choices we make about our food are leading to environmental degradation, enormous human health problems, and unimaginable cruelty toward our fellow creatures.<blockquote>I&#x2019;ve spent the last 30 years exploring the fascinating connections and cause-effect relationships between our individual and cultural practice of using animals for food and the stress and difficulties we create for each other and ourselves. I&#x2019;ve discovered that the violence we instigate for our plates boomerangs in remarkable ways.</blockquote>Incorporating systems theory, teachings from mythology and religions, and the human sciences, <i>The World Peace Diet</i> presents the outlines of a more empowering understanding of our world, based on a comprehension of the far-reaching cultural and spiritual implications of our food choices and the worldview those choices reflect and mandate. The author offers a set of universal principles for all people of conscience, from any religious tradition, that they can follow to reconnect with what we are eating, what was required to get it on our plate, and what happens after it leaves our plates.<blockquote>The song of the new mythos that yearns to be born through us requires our spirits to be loving and alive enough to hear and recognize the pain we are causing through our obsolete food orientation. We are called to allow our innate mercy and kindness to shine forth and to confront the indoctrinated assumptions that promote cruelty.</blockquote>&#x201c;Will Tuttle brings a priceless perspective&#x2015;not only to the planetary crisis confronting us all, but also to powerful ways we each can affect it.

Are you one of them? Church planter and pastor Neil Cole knows about saving lives: he is a former California beach lifeguard. In Search &amp; Rescue, he takes the lessons learned from that experience and applies them to our mission of rescuing people from darkness and leading them into the kingdom of God. Cole presents a passionate and moving plea to continue the work of rescue, along with a simple, proven plan for doing so: the Life Transformation Group. "Simple, uncluttered, apostolic, organic, and eminently doable. I heartily recommend this book to you."--From the foreword by Alan Hirsch, author, The Forgotten Ways and The Shaping of Things to Come "Neil has written a much-needed book. More than raising up pastors and church leaders, the key issue today is raising up disciples if we want to see lives changed and radical transformations take place in our society. What Neil recommends makes a difference."--Bob Roberts, pastor, NorthWood Church; author, Transformation, Glocalization, and The Multiplying Church "Search &amp; Rescue actually works. Neil Cole's network of friends and co-workers is the fastest-growing informal fellowship of believers in the Western world. Why? Because it instantly attracts every person who desires an exciting role as a genuine hero in the greatest adventure of our time."--James Rutz, author, Megashift "In this practical book, Neil gives you everything you need to start patrolling your own beach if you want to get serious about lifesaving efforts."--Reggie McNeal, author, The Present Future "Warning! This is not another self-help book; it will challenge you to save others' lives. If you read it, believe it, and do it, God will use your life to change the world."--Jaeson Ma, lead director, Campus Church Networks; author, The Blueprint "Cole makes Christian disciple making come alive. A captivating story that is solidly biblical and down to earth, with practical application. Right on target!"--Robert E. Coleman, distinguished professor of evangelism and discipleship, Gordon-Conwell Theological Seminary; author, The Master Plan of EvangelismA Tool for Rescue Neil Cole has discovered a simple and powerful tool for accomplishing the task of making and multiplying committed disciples. He calls this method the Life Transformation Group (LTG). The LTG is a group of two or three people who meet together weekly for three essential disciplines: confession of sin, steady intake of Scripture, and prayer for others who need Christ. The genius of the LTG is that it is simple and transferable, making it naturally self-proliferating and an appropriate tool for any cultural or church context.

She spends her free time gardening at her home in Reston, Virginia.</p><p>Chapter 1</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&#x201c;Be careful!&#x201d; I said, looking up from the boxwood hedge I was pruning. &#x201c;We don&#x2019;t want another trip to the emergency room. We&#x2019;ve used up our family quota for the week.&#x201d;</p> <p>My twin four-year-old sons paid no attention, of course. Josh, who was supposed to be collecting the fallen twigs and leaves into small piles, continued to battle an invisible opponent, now using a particularly large, sharp stick I&#x2019;d just pruned off the hedge. Jamie had volunteered for the task of loading the small piles into the wheelbarrow and ferrying them to the large pile by the driveway that was awaiting the eventual arrival of a borrowed chipper/shredder, but his active imagination had transformed the bright red wheelbarrow into a high-powered race car, to judge by his repeated growls of &#x201c;Vroom! Vroom!&#x201d; And his racetrack was starting to inch near the street in front of our house, and while it was a little-traveled country road, cars did pass by often enough that I didn&#x2019;t want the boys getting complacent about playing there.</p> <p>Neither of them heard me. But I wasn&#x2019;t really talking to the boys. My seventeen-year-old niece, Natalie, who would be serving as the boys&#x2019; babysitter this summer, snapped to attention.</p> <p>&#x201c;Josh!&#x201d; she called out. &#x201c;Drop that stick before you put someone&#x2019;s eye out! Jamie! Out of the street! Inside the hedge!&#x201d;</p> <p>I returned to my snipping, satisfied that Natalie was on the case. And that she was beginning to get a handle on her job. She had taken care of the boys two summers ago, but apparently had forgotten how lively they could be. Then again, compared to two summers ago, their capacity for mischief and mayhem had grown exponentially. I&#x2019;d gotten used to the change gradually, as they&#x2019;d grown. Natalie was still catching up.</p> <p>In a day or so, once she was really up to speed, I could retreat for hours each day to the barn where I had my blacksmith&#x2019;s workshop. In fact, I could start retreating the day after tomorrow, when Michael&#x2019;s spring semester ended, and he&#x2019;d have several weeks off before the summer session began. I could delegate training Natalie to him while I hit the anvil. I hadn&#x2019;t had much time for iron work since the boys were born, and had almost given up selling at craft shows. Hard enough to get routine household chores done safely with two increasingly active munchkins underfoot. No way did I want them in the same room when I was heating steel to 2000 degrees Fahrenheit and then whacking on it with a three-pound hammer. I managed to get in a little time at the anvil during Caerphilly College&#x2019;s semester breaks, when Michael was not only willing but eager to spend time with the boys. But I never had enough time to stock my booth for even a modest-sized craft show. And while the higher salary Michael now earned as a tenured professor in the drama department meant we could manage without my crafting income, the money I&#x2019;d earn would be helpful. Besides, I didn&#x2019;t want to lose my hard-won skills.</p> <p>So with Natalie around all summer, I was planning a frenzy of iron work. As soon as I was sure she really understood just how carefully she had to watch &#x201c;Trouble&#x201d; and &#x201c;Danger,&#x201d; as my brother, Rob, had nicknamed his nephews.</p> <p>Today we were easing into what I hoped would become our routine, with her keeping an eye on the boys while I did neglected yard work and repairs and kept an eye on her. It was a beautiful mid-June day, sunny, but not hot&#x2014;perfect weather for being outdoors and enjoying the wealth of flowers in our yard. The azaleas were past, but the mountain laurels, rhododendrons, and magnolias were in bloom, and the scent of the lilacs was almost overpowering. And daylilies were everywhere&#x2014;not just the common orange and yellow ones, but daylilies in every possible shade of red, white, purple, lilac, and pink. A glorious day to be outside.</p> <p>I was relieved to find that Natalie didn&#x2019;t seem to mind being outside. I&#x2019;d been a little worried when she&#x2019;d showed up that first day in a Morticia Addams black dress with trailing, fluttery sleeves. Apparently, since the last time we&#x2019;d seen her, she&#x2019;d taken to dressing entirely in black except for the odd bit of skull- and spider-themed silver jewelry, and her skin was so pale I was afraid she&#x2019;d blister if she stepped outside.</p> <p>But I soon realized that her pallor was due to sunscreen and careful use of makeup, and in spite of looking like a refugee from a low-budget vampire film, she was still the same cheerful, organized, responsible kid she&#x2019;d always been. And she&#x2019;d put away the dress after the first night and was now wearing black jeans, a black T-shirt, black sneakers, and a black baseball cap. I anticipated that some of the more sedate citizens of Caerphilly would look askance at our choice of babysitters, but Michael and I were content. And we&#x2019;d gladly complied with her request to take over a corner of the back yard for her own gardening project, which seemed to involve growing as many black plants as possible. Already, dark-flowered hellebores and nearly black pansies were blooming in her bed, surrounded by neatly raked black mulch, and she&#x2019;d used black ribbons to tie her black tomato and pepper plants to their black iron stakes. I&#x2019;d actually decided that it made a nice restful contrast with the multicolored profusion of the rest of the yard.</p> <p>The four of us had weeded the vegetable garden right after breakfast, and now I was pruning the hedge. Our black-and-copper Welsummer hens were hovering nearby, pouncing on any insects disturbed by my pruning. It was slow going, because I was using hand tools&#x2014;the power hedge clipper, like any other power tool, was too attractive to small eyes and fingers&#x2014;and even the manual clippers were dangerous enough, given the constant danger that an overeager hen would trip me on her way to nab a particularly tempting insect.</p> <p>I switched to the hand pruners to do some fine tuning and continued snipping away, listening carefully to Natalie&#x2019;s interactions with the boys and stifling the urge to offer advice every five seconds or so.</p> <p>&#x201c;Josh, leave the chicken alone. I don&#x2019;t think she wants to play tag.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Jamie, don&#x2019;t jump on the brush pile.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Take that out of your mouth.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Stop throwing rocks at your brother.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think the doggie wants to eat holly leaves.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Leave that alone.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;No, I said later.&#x201d;</p> <p>She was learning. And I was making good progress. Should I try to finish the hedge before lunch? Or would it be wiser to break now, get the boys fed, and have Natalie learn how to put them down for naps? I could finish the hedge while they were asleep and&#x2014;</p> <p>&#x201c;Eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee!&#x201d;</p> <p>Natalie&#x2019;s bloodcurdling scream startled me. My right hand slipped, and I felt a searing pain as the pruners sliced into my left fingers. Just a laceration, though; the fingers themselves were still attached, I noted, as I ran to the other end of the hedge where Natalie and the boys were, wrapping my hand in my shirttail as I ran.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry,&#x201d; Jamie was saying.</p> <p>&#x201c;Only a grass snake,&#x201d; Josh was saying. &#x201c;See?&#x201d;</p> <p>He held up the writhing green reptile that had provoked Natalie&#x2019;s scream. She backed away slightly.</p> <p>&#x201c;Josh, put the snake down,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Maybe Cousin Natalie doesn&#x2019;t like snakes.&#x201d; Which would be rather ironic, since her favorite earrings were a pair of long, dangly silver serpents, but you never knew.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, Meg,&#x201d; Natalie began. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not scared of snakes; really, I&#x2019;m not. I was just startled and&#x2014;oh! What happened?&#x201d;</p> <p>I looked down at my hand. Blood was pouring out of my fingers.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get a bandage.&#x201d; Natalie headed for the house.</p> <p>&#x201c;Blast.&#x201d; It wasn&#x2019;t nearly as satisfying as the &#x201c;damn&#x201d; I&#x2019;d have uttered if the boys were not around. &#x201c;I was hoping we&#x2019;d seen the last of the ER for the week.&#x201d;</p> <p>I gave in to Natalie&#x2019;s insistence that she drive me to the ER. But on the way, I managed to pull out my cell phone and make arrangements for her to take the boys over to visit Mother and Dad for the afternoon.</p> <p>&#x201c;You know how long it always takes at the ER,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;And how restless the boys get.&#x201d;</p> <p>Natalie nodded and looked more cheerful at the prospect of going to her grandparents&#x2019; house instead of spending more hours at the ER. Two days ago Jamie had fallen out of the barn loft and cut his forehead. Yesterday, it had been Josh&#x2019;s turn to get stitches, thanks to a close encounter with a broken pickle jar. Both days, I&#x2019;d accompanied the injured twin back to see the doctor while Natalie tried to keep the other entertained and protect the ER waiting room from collateral damage. She&#x2019;d gone to bed early the last two nights&#x2014;about ten minutes behind the boys.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mommy okay?&#x201d; Jamie asked, as I got out in front of the ER.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be fine,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just going to get some stitches from Grandpa&#x2019;s friend in the ER, like the ones you guys got.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Mommy get ice cream now?&#x201d; Josh asked. A trip to the Caerphilly Ice Cream Parlor had become the standard reward for brave behavior at the ER.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not until later, when you can come with me,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>That idea was well received, and both boys stopped looking anxious.</p> <p>&#x201c;Now don&#x2019;t forget to show Grandpa your stitches so he can make sure they&#x2019;re healing properly.&#x201d; I shut the minivan&#x2019;s door.</p> <p>I watched for a moment as Natalie pulled out of the parking lot. She was a careful driver. And there was a limit to how much mischief the boys could cause while strapped into their car seats. Right?</p> <p>I turned and walked into the ER.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not you again. Which one is it this time?&#x201d;</p> <p>Crystal, a friend who worked at the hospital, was sitting behind the admissions desk.</p> <p>&#x201c;Me,&#x201d; I said. I held up my hand and pulled off the once-clean dish towel wrapped around it. The bleeding had mostly stopped, but since this allowed me a better view of the four deep lacerations along the inside of my fingers, it wasn&#x2019;t entirely an improvement.</p> <p>&#x201c;Yuck,&#x201d; she said, wincing. &#x201c;Wrap it up again and keep the pressure on. Let&#x2019;s get you checked in. Kitchen knife?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Pruning shears.&#x201d;</p> <p>I filled out the now-familiar paperwork&#x2014;actually, I only had to complete a few fields on the form Crystal handed me. A couple of months ago she&#x2019;d added our household to what she called her frequent filer program, which meant that she kept a set of prefilled forms for us in her computer and could just print them out when we came through the door.</p> <p>Then I was ushered back to an even-more-familiar cubicle. Another nurse inspected my hand and then dashed out, apparently satisfied that I was in no immediate danger of bleeding out. No doubt if Dad was in the hospital she&#x2019;d send him in. Although he was, in theory, semiretired, he still spent rather a lot of time here and in the consulting office he&#x2019;d opened in his barn. Meanwhile, the doctor&#x2019;s daughter in me began trying to figure out what was up with all the other patients in the ER, based on what I&#x2019;d seen on my way to my cubicle and what I could overhear now. A possible heart attack in one cubicle. And a kid with a possible concussion in another. Possible appendicitis in a third. Rats. Everyone sounded more dire than me.</p> <p>I sat back and resigned myself to a long wait.</p> <p>My cell phone rang. I answered it quickly&#x2014;always aware of the possibility Natalie was calling to report a new crisis.</p> <p>But it wasn&#x2019;t Natalie. It was Stanley Denton, a private investigator who had set up his office in Caerphilly a few years ago.</p> <p>&#x201c;Could I come out to your house to ask you about something?&#x201d; he asked, after we&#x2019;d exchanged the usual greetings.</p> <p>&#x201c;Not right now,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m actually in the ER at Caerphilly Hospital waiting to get stitches. Just some cuts,&#x201d; I hastened to add. &#x201c;But I have no idea how long I&#x2019;ll be here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Even better,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not the cuts, of course, but I could just stop by the hospital. Only a few blocks from my office, you know. I could talk to you while you&#x2019;re waiting to see the doctor. Help you while away the long delay.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Talk to me about what?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll explain when I get there. Shouldn&#x2019;t be more than a few minutes.&#x201d;</p> <p>It took Stanley about five minutes, and by the time he arrived, Dr. Gridwell, the duty ER doctor, had arrived to examine my hand.</p> <p>&#x201c;We don&#x2019;t give group discounts, you know,&#x201d; the doctor was saying. &#x201c;Not even if you come in together, and certainly not if you straggle in one by one all week. Your father coming down to supervise again?&#x201d;</p> <p>Beneath his nonchalant, bantering tone I detected a note of tension. Gridwell had been the one to stitch up both boys. Not every doctor likes having his patients&#x2019; regular doctor supervising every move he makes. Especially when the doctor was also the patients&#x2019; very opinionated grandfather. Of course, I understood what Dad was up to. Gridwell had only recently joined the staff at Caerphilly Hospital, and Dad was still assessing this new colleague&#x2019;s skills.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dad didn&#x2019;t come with me,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He might still show up if he hears I&#x2019;m here. But maybe if you kick me out pretty soon he won&#x2019;t bother.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Hmph.&#x201d; From the alacrity with which Gridwell bounced out of the room and began throwing around orders to the rest of the staff, I deduced that yes, he would rather get me stitched up and discharged before Dad arrived to second-guess him. And the fact that he was willing to try was good news for the other patients, who presumably were stable, under observation, and in no need of anything urgent.</p> <p>&#x201c;Well played,&#x201d; Denton said. &#x201c;I wonder if I should drop your father&#x2019;s name next time I show up here.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t hurt,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;What can I do for you?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;If you have time to talk,&#x201d; he said, glancing around.</p> <p>&#x201c;Dr. Gridwell can&#x2019;t do anything until someone gets here with the Mayo tray,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;Mayo tray? He&#x2019;s sent out for sandwiches?&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the medical people call that metal rolling cart that you or I would probably call the suture tray. That thing,&#x201d; I added, as the med tech rolled it in.</p> <p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d probably call it the thing they use to bring in the scissors and the sutures and the bandages and all the other stuff the doc needs to put you back together again.&#x201d; Stanley shuddered slightly as the tech began arranging the contents of the tray. &#x201c;Anyway, I want to ask you something about a case.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Ask away,&#x201d; I said.</p> <p>&#x201c;I was wondering if you could come down to Riverton to help me out.&#x201d;</p> <p>I closed my eyes and sighed slightly.</p> <p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s only about forty miles from here, and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Look,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I know my dad seems to think I&#x2019;m Caerphilly County&#x2019;s answer to Nancy Drew or Miss Marple, but he exaggerates my sleuthing skills. And I&#x2019;m pretty busy&#x2014;now that we have a reliable babysitter, I plan to get a lot of blacksmithing done for the fall craft-fair season.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;Not with that hand.&#x201d; Gridwell was back. &#x201c;Trust me, you won&#x2019;t want to be doing much blacksmithing for a few days.&#x201d;</p> <p>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s perfect,&#x201d; Stanley said. &#x201c;This won&#x2019;t take long. And I really don&#x2019;t need for you to do anything. I just need to borrow your face.&#x201d;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Copyright � 2014 by Donna Andrews</p></p><h2>You&#39;ve Been Warned</h2><p>Kristin Burns is making her way in New York City. Her photos are being considered at a major Manhattan gallery, she works by day with two wonderful children, and the man of her dreams is almost hers for keeps. But just as everything she&#39;s ever wanted is finally within reach, her life changes forever--with one murderous nightmare. Kristin wakes up every morning from the same chilling, unforgettable dream. And suddenly, it&#39;s visiting her during the day too. As her life turns stranger by the minute, Kristin is haunted and terrified. Is it all in her head? Or is the nightmare becoming her life? Kristin searches desperately for what&#39;s real through the lens of her camera, only knowing two things for sure: that no place is safe and the fate of everyone she loves lies in her hands.</p><p>James Patterson has had more <i>New York Times</i> bestsellers than any other writer, ever, according to <i>Guinness World Records</i>.

At least Kristin does, and that's when things get creepy. The female perspective of the story is well portrayed by Ilyana Kadushin. She has just enough of a frightened tremor in her voice to communicate the scariness of the situation that develops. When she describes the dead people Kristin sees, dead people who repeatedly warn her of danger, it sounds real. Kadushin's delivery is perfect, adding to the fear and ultimate despair of the story.

Told from the first-person perspective of a young girl sporting raven-colored pigtails, this book catalogues the many challenges that come with a new sibling. From the moment her dad wakes her up in the middle of the night to tell her she is about to be a big sister, the unnamed girl is completely opposed to this intrusion on her life. And things go downhill from there. Her baby brother demands all of her parents' attention and takes over her bedroom. Worst of all, she's expected to be nice to him. The girl finally loses her temper after her brother flushes the car keys, causing her to miss a birthday party. The following spread shows four close-up frames of the baby's face on the left, as he grows increasingly upset. On the right, four frames reflect the girl's increasing guilt at yelling at him. From here, the girl resolves to be a better sister, and the two of them prove to be a formidable team. Kids with younger siblings may identify with the protagonist's feelings. The lengthy text drags at times, but the work's eye-catching illustrations will be a big draw for children. The girl, her baby brother, her pet hamster, and her frenemy, Benny Hogarth, are drawn in a cartoon style with pen and ink on watercolor paper, while the adults and background objects are created digitally.

At this time he studied composition with Mario Castelnuovo-Tedesco at the latter's home in Beverly Hills and attended master classes of Andres Segovia and Julian Bream as a performer.

His interest was primarily in the Indian background to the uprising. Admitting that the Indians had been generally overpowered by the Whites, what led the Indians to think they stood a chance against White arms? His answer was astonishing: the Ghost-Dance Religion.<br>Investigating every Indian uprising from Pontiac to the 1980s, every Indian resistance to aggression, every incident of importance, Mooney discovered a cultural pattern: a messianic religion that permeated leaders and warriors from Tecumseh and his brother The Prophet on up to the Plains tribes that revived the Ghost-Dance in the 1880s and 90s. The message was: abandon the ways of the Whites; go back to Indian ways; an Indian messiah is coming; the Indian dead are to be resurrected &#x2014; indeed, some have already returned; and the Whites are to be killed by the Spirits.<br>Mooney made an exhaustive study of this cult, the rise of its latest version, diffusion to the Plains, and its relevance to the medicine man Sitting Bull and others. Citing many primary documents as well as anthropological data he gathered himself, Mooney gives an extremely detailed, thorough account of the cult; its songs and dances, ceremonies, and its social impact.<br>This work has always been considered one of the great classics of American anthropology, a book that not only offers an account of a very interesting cultural phenomenon, but also throws light on many events in Indian-White relations that are otherwise dark. Its data have never been superseded and the book remains a work of primary importance in Native American studies.</p><p></p><h2>Bright Earth: Art and the Invention of Color</h2><p><br><b>A fascinating study of the evolution of color in art and science from antiquity to the present.</b><br><br>For art in the twentieth century, medium is the message. Many artists offer works defined by their materials. In no aspect is this more strikingly demonstrated than in the use of color.<br> <br><i>Bright Earth </i>is the story of how color evolved and was produced for artistic and commercial use. The modern chemical industry was spawned and nurtured largely by the demand for color as many of today's major chemical companies began as manufacturers of aniline dye; advances in synthetic chemistry, both organic and inorganic, were stimulated in the nineteenth century by the quest for artificial colors. The future holds still more challenges for the color chemist, not only to provide new coloring materials, but also to replace old ones that will shortly become extinct, as concerns about the use of lead and cadmium pigments increase. <br><br>In <i>Bright Earth</i>, Philip Ball brings together the themes of art and science to show that chemical technology and the use of color in art have always existed in a symbiotic relationship that has shaped both their courses throughout history. By tracing their co-evolution, Ball reveals how art is more of a science, and science more of an art, than is commonly appreciated on either side of the fence.<br><br></p><p>The making of a painting relies on inspiration, craft, practice, and vision. But, observes the noted science writer Philip Ball, it also hinges on science: "For as long as painters have fashioned their visions and dreams into images, they have relied on technical knowledge and skill to supply their materials."<p> In this lively study, Ball examines some of the tools and materials that chemists have added to the palette over the centuries. He also takes his readers on a learned tour of what science has taught us about vision, the nature of light, and the physical and cultural factors that condition our perceptions of color (the ancient Romans, he notes, had no term for brown or gray, but that does not mean they didn't use earth pigments in their work). Whether writing of matters scientific or artistic, Ball is a technologist but not a determinist. In the end, he writes, art depends not on science but on artists, and "each artist makes his or her own contract with the colors of the time."</p><p> Readers with an interest in science, art, and the crossroads where they meet will relish Ball's erudite travels across the spectrum of light. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>From Egyptian wall paintings to the Venetian Renaissance, impressionism to digital images, Philip Ball tells the fascinating story of how art, chemistry, and technology have interacted throughout the ages to render the gorgeous hues we admire on our walls and in our museums.<br><br>Finalist for the 2002 National Book Critics Circle Award.</p><h2>The Challenge of Missions</h2><p>This powerful book has sold over 100,000 copies since its first publication and continues to be compelling reading in this period of exciting growth of the worldwide Church!<br></p><p></p><h2>The New Class (Chestnut Hill, Book 1)</h2><p>From the author of the popular Heartland books comes a smart, sassy series set at an exclusive, all-girls boarding school in Virginia, where horses--and status--mean everything.<br><br>Welcome to Chestnut Hill, a prestigious boarding school with a rich tradition of academics, horses, and rivalry.

His legend as the Great Emancipator has grown to mythic proportions as hundreds of books, a national holiday, and a monument in Washington, D.C., extol his heroism and martyrdom. But what if most everything you knew about Lincoln were false? What if, instead of an American hero who sought to free the slaves, Lincoln were in fact a calculating politician who waged the bloodiest war in american history in order to build an empire that rivaled Great Britain's? In <i>The Real Lincoln,</i> author Thomas J. DiLorenzo uncovers a side of Lincoln not told in many history books and overshadowed by the immense Lincoln legend. <br>Through extensive research and meticulous documentation, DiLorenzo portrays the sixteenth president as a man who devoted his political career to revolutionizing the American form of government from one that was very limited in scope and highly decentralized&#x2014;as the Founding Fathers intended&#x2014;to a highly centralized, activist state. Standing in his way, however, was the South, with its independent states, its resistance to the national government, and its reliance on unfettered free trade. To accomplish his goals, Lincoln subverted the Constitution, trampled states' rights, and launched a devastating Civil War, whose wounds haunt us still. According to this provacative book, 600,000 American soldiers did not die for the honorable cause of ending slavery but for the dubious agenda of sacrificing the independence of the states to the supremacy of the federal government, which has been tightening its vise grip on our republic to this very day.<br>You will discover a side of Lincoln that you were probably never taught in school&#x2014;a side that calls into question the very myths that surround him and helps explain the true origins of a bloody, and perhaps, unnecessary war. <br><br>"A devastating critique of America's most famous president."<br>&#x2014;<b>Joseph Sobran,</b> commentator and nationally syndicated columnist<br><br>"Today's federal government is considerably at odds with that envisioned by the framers of the Constitution.

This suspenseful tale begins in a detective's office in Venice, as the entirely unpleasant Hartliebs request Victor Getz's services to search for two boys, Prosper and Bo, the sons of Esther Hartlieb's recently deceased sister. Twelve-year-old Prosper and 5-year-old Bo ran away when their aunt decided she wanted to adopt Bo, but not his brother. Refusing to split up, they escaped to Venice, a city their mother had always described reverently, in great detail. Right away they hook up with a long-haired runaway named Hornet and various other ruffians who hole up in an abandoned movie theater and worship the elusive Thief Lord, a young boy named Scipio who steals jewels from fancy Venetian homes so his new friends can get the warm clothes they need. Of course, the plot thickens when the owner of the pawn shop asks if the Thief Lord will carry out a special mission for a wealthy client: to steal a broken wooden wing that is the key to completing an age-old, magical merry-go-round. This winning cast of characters--especially the softhearted detective with his two pet turtles--will win the hearts of readers young and old, and the adventures are as labyrinthine and magical as the streets of Venice itself.

The latest edition includes new material on how social media and video game culture are affecting our children, and what parents can do.<br>&nbsp;<br>In <i>Hold On to Your Kids</i>, Dr. Neufeld and Dr. Mat� explore the phenomenon of peer orientation: the troubling tendency of children and youth to look to their peers for direction--for a sense of right and wrong, for values, identity and codes of behaviour.

But peer orientation undermines family cohesion, poisons the school atmosphere, and fosters an aggressively hostile and sexualized youth culture. It provides a powerful explanation for schoolyard bullying and youth violence; its effects are painfully evident in the context of teenage gangs and criminal activity, in tragedies such as in Littleton, Colorado; Tabor, Alberta and Victoria, B.C. It is an escalating trend that has never been adequately described or contested until Hold On to Your Kids. Once understood, it becomes self-evident -- as do the solutions. <br>Hold On to Your Kids will restore parenting to its natural intuitive basis and the parent-child relationship to its rightful preeminence. The concepts, principles and practical advice contained in Hold On to Your Kids will empower parents to satisfy their children's inborn need to find direction by turning towards a source of authority, contact and warmth. <p>"Something has changed. One can sense it, one can feel it, just not find the words for it. Children are not quite the same as we remember being. They seem less likely to take their cues from adults, less inclined to please those in charge, less afraid of getting into trouble.Parenting, too, seems to have changed. Our parents seemed more confident, more certain of themselves and had more impact on us, for better or for worse. For many, parenting does not feel natural. Adults through the ages have complained about children being less respectful of their elders and more difficult to manage than preceding generations, but could it be that this time it is for real? -- from Hold On to Your Kids </p><p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p><b>Praise for <i>Scattered Minds</i> by Gabor Mat�, M.D.<br></b>&#x201c;Rare and refreshing. . . .

The title refers to a form of navigation he resorted to as a first mate in the Navy during World War II. As he says, &#x201c;As I was writing this account of my life and times since <i>Palimpsest</i>, I felt as if I were again dealing with those capes and rocks in the Bering Sea that we had to navigate so often with a compass made inoperable by weather.&#x201d; It is a beautifully apt analogy for the hazards (mostly) eluded during his eventful life and for the way this memoir proceeds&#x2014;far from linear but always on course.<br><br>From his desks in Ravello and the Hollywood Hills, Gore Vidal travels in memory through the arenas of literature, television, film, theater, politics and international society where he has cut a broad swath, recounting achievements and defeats, friends and enemies made (and on a number of occasions lost). Among the gathering of notables to be found in these pages, sketched with a draftsman&#x2019;s ease and evoked with the panache of one of our great raconteurs, are Jack and Jacqueline Kennedy, Tennessee Williams (the &#x201c;Glorious Bird&#x201d;), Eleanor Roosevelt, Orson Welles, Johnny Carson, Greta Garbo, Federico Fellini, Rudolph Nureyev, Elia Kazan, and Francis Ford Coppola. Some of the book&#x2019;s most moving pages are devoted to the illness and death of his partner of five decades, Howard Austen, and indeed the book is, among other things, a meditation on mortality written in the spirit of Montaigne.<br><br>Elegiac yet vital and even ornery, <i>Point to Point Navigation</i> is a summing-up of Gore Vidal&#x2019;s time on the planet that manages to be at once supremely entertaining, endlessly provocative, and thoroughly moving.</p><p>Gore Vidal is the author of twenty-two novels, five plays, many screenplays, more than two hundred essays, and the critically lauded memoir, <i>Palimpsest</i>. Vidal&#x2019;s <i>United States (Essays 1952&#x2013;92)</i> won the 1993 National Book Award.

Naturally, Sex and Art always took precedence over cinema but neither ever proved to be as dependable as the filtering of present light through that moving strip of celluloid which projects past images and voices onto a screen. Thus, in a seemingly simple process, screening history. (My book of that name has been allowed to go out of print and so I now reprise its principal argument.)<br><br>As writer and political activist, I have accumulated a number of cloudy trophies in my melancholy luggage. Some real, some imagined. Some acquired from life, such as it is; some from movies, such as they are. Sometimes, in time, where we are as well as were, it is not easy to tell the two apart. Do I wake or sleep?<br><br>I was born October 3, 1925, on the twenty-fifth birthday of Thomas Wolfe, the novelist not the journalist. I have lived through three-quarters of the twentieth century, and about one-third of the history of the United States of America. Briefly, what has been your impression thus far, Mr. Vidal? as eager interviewers are wont to ask. <i>Well</i>, it could have been worse, I begin with a calculated understatement. Then the Japanese recording machine goes on the blink and while the interviewer tries to fix it, he asks me to tell him, off the record, what was Marilyn Monroe really like? As I barely knew her, I tell him.<br><br>It is a universal phenomenon that whether one is at Harvard or at Oxford or at the University of Bologna, after the dutiful striking of attitudes on subjects of professional interest, like semiology, the ice does not break until someone mentions the movies. Suddenly, everyone is alert and adept. There is real passion as we speak of the falling-off of Fellini in recent years (of which more later) or of Madonna's curious contours and have they yet passed the once-disputed border of mere androgyny, arriving at some entirely new sexual continuum? Movies are the lingua franca of the twentieth century. The Tenth Muse, as they call the movies in Italy, has driven the other nine right off Parnassus&#x2014;or off the peak, anyway.<br><br>Recently I observed to a passing tape recorder that I was once a famous novelist. When assured, politely, that I was still known and read, I explained myself. I was speaking, I said, not of me personally but of a category to which I once belonged that has now ceased to exist. I am still here but the category is not. To speak today of a famous novelist is like speaking of a famous cabinetmaker or speedboat designer. Adjective is inappropriate to noun. How can a novelist be famous&#x2014;no matter how well known he may be personally to the press?&#x2014;if the novel itself is of little consequence to the civilized, much less to the generality? The novel as teaching aid is something else, but hardly famous.<br><br>There is no such thing as a famous novelist now, any more than there is such a thing as a famous poet. I use the adjective in the strict sense. According to authority, to be famous is to be much talked about, usually in a favorable way. It is as bleak and inglorious as that. Yet thirty years ago, novels were actually read and discussed by those who did not write them or, indeed, even read them. A book could be famous then but today's public seldom mentions a book unless, like The Da Vinci Code, it is being metamorphosed into a faith&#x2013;challenging film.<br><br>Contrary to what many believe, literary fame has nothing to do with excellence or true glory or even with a writer's position in the syllabus of a university's English Department, itself as remote to the Agora as Academe's shadowy walk. For any artist, fame is the extent to which the Agora finds interesting his latest work. If what he has written is known only to a few other practitioners, or to enthusiasts (Faulkner compared lovers of literature to dog breeders, few in number but passionate to the point of madness on the subject of bloodlines), then the artist is not only not famous, he is irrelevant to his time, the only time that he has; nor can he dream of eager readers in a later century as did Stendhal. If novels and poems fail to interest the Agora today, by the year 3091 such artifacts will not exist at all except as objects of monkish interest. This is neither a good nor a bad thing. It is simply not a famous thing.<br><br>Optimists, like the late John Gardner, regarded the university as a great good place where literature would continue to be not only worshipped but created. Perhaps he was right, though I do not like the look of those fierce theoreticians currently hacking away at the olive trees of Academe while seeding the Cephisus River with significant algae, their effect on the sacred waters rather like that of an oil spill off the coast of Alaska. Can there be a famous literary theoretician? Alas, no. The Agora has no interest in parlor games, other than contract bridge when one of the players is Omar Sharif. Literary theory is a glass-bead game whose reward for the ludic player is the knowledge that once he masters it, he will be thought by his peers to be ludicrous.<br><br>But I have lately been taken to task by an English teacher for my &#x201c;intemperate&#x201d; attacks on English Departments, which have, she noted ominously, cost me my place in the syllabus. So I shall now desist and, like Jonah, wait for that greatest of fishes to open wide his jaws and take me in. After all, if you miss one syllabus, there'll always be another in the next decade.<br><br>The best of our literary critics was V. S. Pritchett. I find fascinating his descriptions of what the world was like in his proletarian youth. Books were central to the Agora of 1914. Ordinary Londoners were steeped in literature, particularly Dickens. People saw themselves in literary terms, saw themselves as Dickensian types while Dickens himself, earlier, had mirrored the people in such a way that writer and Agora were, famously, joined; and each defined the other.<br><br>In London, Pritchett and I belonged to the same club. One afternoon we were sitting in the bar when a green-faced bishop stretched out his gaitered leg and tripped up a rosy-faced mandarin from Whitehall. As the knight fell against the wall, the bishop roared, &#x201c;Pelagian heretic!&#x201d;I stared with wonder. Pritchett looked very pleased. &#x201c;Never forget,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;Dickens was a highly realistic novelist.&#x201d;<br><br>Today, where literature was movies are. Whether or not the Tenth Muse does her act on a theater screen or within the cathode tube, there can be no other reality for us since reality does not begin to mean until it has been made art of. For the Agora, Art is now sight and sound; and the books are shut. In fact, reading of any kind is on the decline. Half the American people never read a newspaper. Half never vote for president&#x2014;the same half?<br> <br><b>TWO</b><br> <br>In 1925, the year that I was born, <i>An American Tragedy</i>, <i>Arrowsmith</i>, <i>Manhattan Transfe</i>r, and <i>The Great Gatsby</i> were published. A nice welcoming gift, I observed to the Three Wise Men from PEN who attended me in my cradle, a bureau drawer in Washington, D.C.'s, Rock Creek Park. I shall be worthy! I proclaimed; shepherds quaked.<br><br>For a moment, back then, it did look as if Whitman&#x2019;s dream of that great audience which would in turn create great writers had come true. Today, of course, when it comes to literacy, the United States ranks number twenty&#x2013;three in the world. I have no idea what our ranking was then, but though the popular culture was a predictable mix of jazz and the Charleston and Billy Sunday, we must have had, proportionately, more and better readers then than now; literature was a part of life, and characters from contemporary fiction, like Babbitt, entered the language, as they had done in Pritchett's youth and before. Our public educational system was also a good one. Certainly the <i>McGuffey&#x2019;s Eclectic Readers</i> of my grandfather's day would now be considered intolerably highbrow.<br><br>True, the Tenth Muse was already installed atop Parnassus, but she was mute. Actually, the movies were not as popular in the twenties as they had been before the First World War. Even so, in the year of my birth, Chaplin&#x2019;s <i>The Gold Rush</i> was released, while in my second year there appeared not only DeMille&#x2019;s <i>The Ten Commandments</i> as well as, no doubt in the interest of symmetry, <i>Flesh and the Devil with Greta Garbo</i>; it was also in my second year that the Tenth Muse suddenly spoke those minatory words &#x201c;You ain't heard nothin&#x2019; yet.&#x201d; Thus, the moving and talking picture began.<br><br>I saw and heard my first movie in 1929. My father and mother were still unhappily married and so we went, a nuclear family melting down, to the movies in St. Louis, where my father was general manager of TAT, the first transcontinental airline, later to merge with what became TWA.<br><br>I am told that as I marched down the aisle, an actress on the screen asked another character a question, and I answered her, in a very loud voice. So, as the movies began to talk, I began to answer questions posed by two-dimensional fictional characters thirty times my size.<br><br>My life has paralleled, when not intersected, the entire history of the talking picture. Although I was a compulsive reader from the age of six, I was so besotted by movies that one Saturday in Washington, D.C., where I grew up, I saw five movies in a day. It took time and effort and money to see five movies in a day; now, with television and videocassettes and DVDs, the screen has come to the viewer and we are all home communicants.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t think anyone has ever found startling the notion that it is not what things are that matters so much as how they are perceived. We perceive sex, say, not as it demonstrably is but as we think it ought to be as carefully distorted for us by the churches and the schools, and ...</p><h2>What Love is This? Calvinism&#39;s Misrepresentation of God</h2><p>Many sincere, Bible-believing Christians are Calvinists only by default. Thinking that the only choice is between Calvinism (with its presumed doctrine of eternal security) and Arminianism (with its teaching that salvation can be lost), and confident of Christ's promise to keep eternally those who believe in Him, they therefore consider themselves to be Calvinists.<br> &nbsp;<br> It takes only a few simple questions to discover that most Christians are largely unaware of what John Calvin and his early followers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries actually believed and practiced. Nor do they fully understand what most of today's leading Calvinists believe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Although there are disputed variations of the Calvinist doctrine, among its chief proponents (whom we quote extensively in context) there is general agreement on certain core beliefs. Many evangelicals who think they are Calvinists will be surprised to learn of Calvin's belief in salvation through infant baptism and of his grossly un-Christian behavior, at times, as the "Protestant Pope" of Geneva, Switzerland. Most shocking of all, however, is Calvinism's misrepresentation of God, who &#x201c;is love.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> It is our prayer that this volume will enable readers to examine more carefully the vital issues involved and to follow God's holy Word�&#x2014;not man&#x2019;s teachings. "The first edition of this book was greeted by fervent opposition and criticism from Calvinists. In this enlarged and revised edition I have endeavored to respond to the critics." &#x2014;Dave Hunt</p><p>Dave Hunt ministered worldwide for nearly forty years, encouraging millions of believers to diligently study God's Word and leading many to Christ.

Why would it be necessary for Satan to blind men&#x2019;s eyes if all are totally depraved as Calvinism defines it and are thus already as spiritually blind as one could ever be? Indeed, they are dead, and dead men can&#x2019;t see. Calvinism is again refuted because it makes this passage meaningless, as it does so many others. </p><p>As for the elect, if, as Calvinism declares, they are sovereignly regenerated and by Irresistible Grace given the faith to believe, and nothing can prevent them from hearing and believing the gospel, it would be impossible for Satan to blind them and therefore there would be no point in his even trying. There would be no real battle between God and Satan for souls, no real conflict within the human heart, the whole thing having already been decided by God with nothing Satan or man could do to change that fact. Paul would have simply been wasting his time disputing and persuading &#x2013; and the same would be true of our seeking to win to Christ those whom God has predestined to hell. </p><p> Calvinism, if it were true, would be great news to Satan. He wouldn&#x2019;t need to deceive the lost to prevent them from believing the gospel because God himself would already have consigned them to hell. As for the elect, because of irresistible Grace, Satan would be wasting his time trying to blind or harden them. There would be no point in trying to blind anyone. </p><p> If by withholding irresistible grace God were already doing a better job of damning souls than Satan ever could, and man had no choice in the matter, that enemy of souls could go on a long vacation. Yet the Bible declares, "the great dragon...that old serpent, called the Devil, and Satan,...deceiveth the whole world" (Revelation 12:9). We wonder what is the need for deception, and why "whole world" doesn&#x2019;t mean the elect here, as it supposedly does in other places. </p><p> "As many as received him..." sounds as though the volitional act of receiving is required on the part of the convicted sinner. Eternal life is a free gift. A gift cannot be merited, earned or paid for in any way, but it must be received. Surely to "receive" requires some acquiescence on the part of the recipient. Anything imposed upon someone by a grace that is " irresistible" is not a gift received. </p><p> Indeed, how can grace be irresistible? The very term "irresistible grace" is self-contradictory. How can it be an act of "grace" to force upon someone something he hasn&#x2019;t believed and doesn&#x2019;t desire? "God doesn&#x2019;t force anyone," says the Calvinist. Then what does "irresistible mean? "God is just removing their resistance," is the reply. Irresistibly removing it? If it is not against their will, why must it be irresistible? </p><p> Would that not fill heaven with those who were unwilling to believe in Christ, to love God or even to be there, but who had been irresistibly made willing? "Not so," counters the Calvinist in defense of his theory. "God through Irresistible Grace has wrought a regenerative transformation so that those thus blessed truly love God from their hearts." </p><p> But if this could be done for the elect, it could be done for all mankind. How could the infinite love of God leave anyone out? That brings us back to the compelling question: What love is this that loves so few? And why would the God of truth plead with a world of totally depraved individuals to repent and believe the gospel when He had already predestined them to doom?</p></p><h2>Incandesence: 365 Readings With Women Mystics</h2><p>A collection of fresh translations from the writings of famous and not-so-famous mystics--present &#34;women&#39;s ways of knowing&#34; that offer a way to peace, laughter, love, and connection with each other and a tender, nurturing God through meditation, prayer, poem and song.

Besides being an insider's account of the rise and fall of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC), it is an eyewitness report of the strategies and the conflicts in the crucial battle zones as the fight for racial justice raged across the South.</p><p>This memoir by Cleveland Sellers, a SNCC volunteer, traces his zealous commitment to activism from the time of the sit-ins, demonstrations, and freedom rides in the early '60s. In a narrative encompassing the Mississippi Freedom Summer (1964), the historic march in Selma, the Democratic National Convention in Atlantic City, and the murders of civil rights activists in Mississippi, he recounts the turbulent history of SNCC and tells the powerful story of his own no-return dedication to the cause of civil rights and social change.</p><p><i>The River of No Return</i> is acclaimed as a book that has become a standard text for those wishing to perceive the civil rights struggle from within the ranks of one of its key organizations and to note the divisive history of the movement as groups striving for common goals were embroiled in conflict and controversy.</p></p><p><p>In 1962,&nbsp;at the age of seventeen, Cleveland Sellers joined the Nonviolent Action Group, an affiliate of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Sellers had grown up in Denmark, South Carolina, in a comfortable, middle-class home; now, working with SNCC, his eyes were opened to the full depth of the struggle against white oppression. Soon Sellers, along with Stokely Carmichael, had become a top official in the organization, and played a key role in SNCC&#x2019;s Freedom Summer in 1964.</p><p><em>The River of No Return</em> is both the story of one young man&#x2019;s journey, and an insider&#x2019;s account of the civil rights movement. Sellers writes of the early sit-ins coordinated by SNCC; of the murders of James Chaney, Andrew Goodman, and Michael Schwerner by the Ku Klux Klan; the Selma Campaign; the Meredith march; and the many other key events of these tumultuous years. Through his eyes we see the birth of Black Power, and then, ultimately, the fragmentation of the movement and the demise of SNCC after the departure of Carmichael. Intertwined with Sellers&#x2019;s personal story are intimate portraits of the others who helped build the movement, among them Martin Luther King Jr., Julian Bond, Stokely Carmichael, John Lewis, and Bob Moses.&nbsp;</p><p>A classic memoir of civil rights, organizing, and the struggle for black identity, <em>The River of No Return</em> is as timely today as it was when it was first published in 1973.</p>The River of No Return is, quite simply, one of the two or three most important books to come out of the Civil Rights Movement. [Sellers&#39;s] book is as timely now as it was when he wrote it nearly two decades ago.&#34;--John Dittmer</p><h2>Inner Transformations Using Essential Oils: Powerful Cleansing Protocols for Increase Energy and Better Health</h2><p>Following a seasonal approach to internal cleansing, chiropractor authors LeAnne and David Deardeuff offer insight gained through years of clinical practice using essential oils.

In Cut and Paste: 400 Years of Collage, we trace its origins back to books and prints of the 1500s, through to the boom in popularity of scrapbooks and do-it-yourself collage during the Victorian period, and then through Cubism, Futurism, Dada and Surrealism. Collage became the technique of choice in the 1960s and 1970s for anti-establishment protest, and in the present day is used by millions of us through digital devices.

Tolkien&#39;s Lord of the Rings</h2><p>Sometimes childish, sometimes rude, always clever and always very, very funny, this book has delighted most, and outraged a few, Tolkien fans in the US for nearly 30 years. Pulling in references to popular culture and fantasy literature as a whole, this is a killingly effective parody of LORD OF THE RINGS. From the dreary Goddamn (Gollum), to the feckless Arrowroot (Aragorn), the bungling Goodgulf (Gandalf) to the timid, meanminded boggies Frito (Frodo) and Dildo (Bilbo), no character is safe. Fleeing the Nozdrul, bored by acid-casualty Tim Benzedrine and harrassed throughout by the minions of Sorhed, the fellowship move through a Middle Earth like no other. Short, sharp and very much to the point, even Tolkien would be hard-pressed to surpress a giggle at BORED OF THE RINGS.</p><p>Written in the gloaming of their college days, just before they started <i>National Lampoon</i>, Douglas C. Kenney and Henry N. Beard wrote <i>Bored of the Rings</i>. It's dated--references to Nixon, drugs, and consumer products circa 1969 crowd every page--but darn it, <i>Bored of the Rings</i> is still funny nearly 30 years later: "'Goodbye, Dildo,' Frito said, stifling a sob. 'I wish you were coming with us.' <p> 'Ah, yes. But I'm too old for that sort of thing now,' said the old boggie, feigning a state of total quadriplegia. 'Anyway, I have a few small gifts for you,' and he produced a lumpy parcel, which Frito opened somewhat unenthusiastically in view of Dildo's previous going-away present [the ring]. But the package only contained a short, Revereware sword, a bulletproof vest full of moth holes, and several well-thumbed novellas with titles like Elf Lust and Goblin Girl..." </p><p> Place yourself in the hands of these professional humorists: you won't be disappointed.</p>The Harvard Lampoon was essentially Douglas Kenney and Henry Beard. They wrote Bored of the Rings when they were students at Harvard. They then went on to form the National Lampoon, a satirical institution in the 70s.

Elizabeth Norman presents a war story in which the main characters never kill one of the enemy, or even shoot at him, but are nevertheless heroes. . . . First on Bataan, then moved to Corregidor, they were under almost constant shell fire, were always hungry, close to starvation, had horrendous diseases to deal with despite a shortage or even a complete lack of proper medicines, getting little or no sleep, nothing in the way of recreation--yet they were a true band of angels, inspiring all the men whom they were there to help. In a squalid prison camp, they remained giants, despite their small size. . . . They were the bravest of the brave, who endured unspeakable pain and torture. Americans today should thank God we had such women."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --Stephen E. Ambrose<br><br><b>We Band of Angels</b> is the story of women searching for adventure, caught up in the drama and danger of war.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>On the same day the Japanese Imperial Navy launched its surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, it also struck American bases in the Far East, chief among them the Philippines. That raid led to the first major land battle for America in World War II and, in the end, to the largest defeat and surrender of American forces. Caught up in all of this were ninety-nine Army and Navy nurses--the first unit of American women ever sent into the middle of a battle.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>The "Angels of Bataan and Corregidor"--as the newspapers called them--became the only group of American women captured and imprisoned by an enemy. And the story of their trials on a bloody battlefield, their desperate flight to avoid capture and their ultimate surrender, imprisonment, liberation and homecoming is a story of endurance, professionalism and raw pluck.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Along the way, they helped build and staff hospitals in the middle of a malaria-infested jungle on the peninsula of Bataan. Then, short of supplies and medicine, they worked around the clock in the operating rooms and open-air wards, dealing with gaping wounds and gangrenous limbs, ministering to the wounded, the sick, the dying. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>A few fell in love, only to lose their men to the enemy. Finally, on the tiny island of Corregidor in Manila Bay, the Japanese took them prisoner. For three long years in an internment camp--years marked by loneliness and starvation--they kept to their mission and stuck together. In the end, it was this loyalty, this sense of purpose, womanhood and honor, that both challenged and saved them.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Through interviews with survivors and through unpublished letters, diaries and journals, Elizabeth M. Norman vividly re-creates that time, telling the story in richly drawn portraits and in a dramatic narrative delivered in the voices of the women who were there.</p><p><i>"Found worms in my oatmeal this morning. I shouldn't have objected because they had been sterilized in the cooking and I was getting fresh meat with my breakfast.... I'm still losing weight and so are most of us..."</i><p> Ruth Marie Straub, an Army nurse, wrote those words in her diary on March 15, 1942, just over three months after the Japanese first bombed the U.S. military base in Manila. She and her colleagues had evacuated the city and established, in the Philippine jungle, hospitals for the skyrocketing numbers of casualties. In the face of the advancing Japanese Army, the nurses and other military personnel continued to retreat, first to the Bataan Peninsula, and then to Corregidor, a rocky island in Manila Bay. Straub was one of the lucky ones; she was evacuated with a handful of other nurses in April 1942. Her remaining colleagues, meanwhile, surrendered with the rest of the U.S. forces in May and were taken to STIC--Santo Tomas Internment Camp, where they were to spend nearly three years in captivity.</p><p> <i>We Band of Angels</i> tells the stories of these courageous women, tagged by the American media as "The Angels of Bataan and Corregidor." Utilizing a wide range of sources, including diaries, letters, and personal interviews with surviving "Angels," Elizabeth M. Norman has compiled a harrowing narrative about the experiences of these women--from the country-club atmosphere of prewar Manila; to the jungle hospitals where patients slept on bamboo cots in the open air; to the Malinta Tunnel on Corregidor, where they choked on dust and worked while the bombs rained down above them; to the STIC, where per-person rations were cut to 900 calories a day and the women resorted to frying weeds in cold cream for food. The story Nelson tells is compelling but slightly flawed: like many biographers, Nelson has a deep affection and respect for her subjects, which causes her to soften rough edges. At the same time, however, Nelson argues that these women were not heroes--nor were they angels (in the acknowledgments, Nelson notes that she didn't want the word <i>angels</i> in the title, but the publishers had their way). Perhaps because Nelson is a nurse herself, she is trying to stress that her profession is noble and that these women were, in a sense, just fulfilling their duties.</p><p> Nursing <i>is</i> noble, of course, but it is clear that these women were something special. Amazingly, all of the Angels of Bataan, some 99 in number, survived their ordeal--and clearly helped hundreds of the other sufferers survive. <i>We Band of Angels</i> deserves a space on the bookshelves of anyone interested in World War II. <i>--C.B. Delaney</i></p><b>Advance praise for We Band of Angels</b><p>"From diaries, letters and interviews with aging survivors, Elizabeth Norman has filled in a vital but missing chapter in the history of World War II: the stunning heroism of women. Bombing raids. Malaria. Starvation. Capture. Survival. Here is the little-known story of the Army and Navy nurses caught in the brutal retreat of U.S. forces from Manila to Bataan to Corregidor, and eventually to three years in a Japanese prisoner-of-war camp. It is as inspiring as it is horrific."<br>--Linda Bird Francke</p><p>"Elizabeth Norman brings a powerful new voice to the nonfiction literature of war, combining first-rate reportage with a lyrical narrative style to present an unforgettable story of courage and character. We Band of Angels is at once a terrific read and a classic study of human behavior under extreme duress, seen from the perspective of women nurses held captive under the harshest conditions imaginable in the jungles of the Philippines during World War II. These nurses were independent, professional and fearless long before American society encouraged such behavior in women. They saw the worst of war, and, thanks to Norman's</p><p>masterpiece, their heroism can be forgotten no more."<br>--David Maraniss</p></p><h2>Once Upon a Dream (A Twisted Tale): A Twisted Tale</h2><p>What if the sleeping beauty never woke up? <i>Once Upon a Dream</i> marks the second book in a new YA line that reimagines classic Disney stories in surprising new ways. <br>It should be simple--a dragon defeated, a slumbering princess in a castle, a prince poised to wake her. But when the <i>prince</i> falls asleep as his lips touch the fair maiden's, it is clear that this fairy tale is far from over. <br>With a desperate fairy's last curse controlling her mind, Princess Aurora must escape from a <i>different</i> castle of thorns and navigate a dangerously magical landscape--created from her very own dreams. Aurora isn't alone--a charming prince is eager to join her quest, and old friends offer their help. But as Maleficent's agents follow her every move, Aurora struggles to discover who her true allies are and, moreover, who <i>she</i> truly is. Time is running out.

As always, Gorey's painstakingly cross- hatched pen and ink drawings are perfectly suited to his oddball verse and prose. The first book of 15, "The Unstrung Harp," describes the writing process of novelist Mr. Clavius Frederick Earbrass: "He must be mad to go on enduring the unexquisite agony of writing when it all turns out drivel." In "The Listing Attic," you'll find a set of quirky limericks such as "A certain young man, it was noted, / Went about in the heat thickly coated; / He said, 'You may scoff, / But I shan't take it off; / Underneath I am horribly bloated.' " <p> Many of Gorey's tales involve untimely deaths and dreadful mishaps, but much like tragic Irish ballads with their perky rhythms and melodies, they come off as strangely lighthearted. "The Gashlycrumb Tinies," for example, begins like this: "A is for AMY who fell down the stairs, B is for BASIL assaulted by bears," and so on. An eccentric, funny book for either the uninitiated or diehard Gorey fans.</p><b>Edward Gorey</b>, known for his unsettling pen-and-ink drawings with a Victorian flair, wrote and illustrated such books as <i>The Doubtful Guest, The Gashlycrumb Tinies</i>, and <i>The Headless Bust</i>.

This deluxe reissue features a new Todd Lockwood cover and an introduction from <i>The New York Times</i> best-selling author Philip Athans, who has served as Salvatore's editor for almost a decade, starting with the original release of this book.</p><p>Everybody's favorite introspective dark elf butt-kicker is back. And if you're one of the many fans of R.A. Salvatore's phenomenally popular twin-scimitar-swinger, you won't be disappointed. <i>The Silent Blade</i> is old-school Drizzt, an adventure that brings together the original gang: the lovely Cattie-brie, the plump and mischievous Regis, the gruff dwarven father-figure Bruenor, and the even more gruff barbarian hammer-hurler Wulfgar. Better yet, <i>The Silent Blade</i> brings back Drizzt's best worst nemesis, master assassin Artemis Entreri. Throw in the evil artifact Crenshinibon (a.k.a. the Crystal Shard, the namesake of the first Drizzt Do'Urden book), and you know you're in for a good time.<p> The plot follows three intertwined threads: Drizzt and Co.'s road trip to destroy Crenshinibon, Wulfgar's struggle to overcome the scars of his imprisonment at the claws of the demon Errtu, and Artemis Entreri's long-awaited return to the seamy streets of Calimport. The action is as lively as ever, with giants and goblins and thieves all getting their deserved lumps at the hands of our heroes, and of course Drizzt continues his meditations on life with a capital <i>L</i>. The book's highlight, though, comes when Do'Urden and Entreri cross paths once again, this time with surprising results.

Enthusiastic and full of energy, young Summer spends her time swimming, building sand castles, picking berries, and camping in the cool forest. Under the watchful eye of Mother Earth and Father Time, the youngster rushes from one activity to another. The two admonish her not to neglect her chores but she is having too much fun to stop her frolicking. It is not until she pauses on a mountaintop that she realizes what her negligence has done-the Earth is dry and brown. Promising to work around the clock, Summer sprinkles water until the rivers flow and the animals begin to stir.

How should members of the church interact with such a culture, especially as deeply enmeshed as most of us have become?<br><br>D. A. Carson applies his masterful touch to this problem. He begins by exploring the classic typology of H. Richard Niebuhr with its five Christ-culture options. Carson proposes that these disparate options are in reality one still larger vision. Using the Bible's own story line and the categories of biblical theology, he clearly lays out that unifying vision. Carson acknowledges the helpfulness of Niebuhr's grid and similar matrices but warns against giving them canonical force.<br><br>More than just theoretical,&nbsp;<i>Christ and Culture Revisited</i>&nbsp;is also designed practically to help Christians untangle current messy debates on living in the world. Carson emphasizes that the relation between Christ and culture is not limited to an either/or cultural paradigm -- Christ&nbsp;<i>against</i>&nbsp;culture or Christ<i>transforming</i>&nbsp;culture. Instead Carson offers his own paradigm in which&nbsp;<i>all</i>&nbsp;the categories of biblical theology must be kept in mind simultaneously to inform the Christian worldview.<br><br>While many other books on culture interact with Niebuhr, none of them takes anything like the biblical-theological approach adopted here.

Growing from Peter Minuit's tiny settlement of 1626 to one with more than three million immigrants today, the city has always been a magnet for transplants from all over the globe. It is only fitting that the United States, a "nation of immigrants," is home to the only world city built primarily by immigration. More immigrants have entered the United States through New York than through all other entry points combined, making New York's immigrant saga a quintessentially American story.<br><br><i>City of Dreams</i> is the long-overdue, inspiring, and defining account of New York's both famous and forgotten immigrants: the young man from the Caribbean who relocated to New York and became a Founding Father; an Italian immigrant who toiled for years at railroad track maintenance before achieving his dream of becoming a nationally renowned poet; Russian-born Emma Goldman, who condoned the murder of American industrialists as a means of aiding downtrodden workers; Dominican immigrant Oscar de la Renta, who dressed first ladies from Jackie Kennedy to Michelle Obama. Over ten years in the making, Tyler Anbinder's story is one of innovators and artists, revolutionaries and rioters, staggering deprivation and soaring triumphs. Today's immigrants are really no different from those who have come to America in centuries past&#x2014;and their story has never before been told with such breadth of scope, lavish research, and resounding spirit.</p><p>Advance praise for <i>City of Dreams</i><br> &#x201c;A masterful achievement, <i>City of Dreams</i> is the definitive account of the American origin story, as told through our premier metropolis.

To find the answers, Weaver must contend with a desperate prostitute who knows too much about his past, relatives who remind him of his alienation from the Jewish faith, and a cabal of powerful men in the world of British finance who have hidden their business dealings behind an intricate web of deception and violence. Relying on brains and brawn, Weaver uncovers the beginnings of a strange new economic order based on stock speculation--a way of life that poses great risk for investors but real danger for Weaver and his family.<br><br>In the tradition of <i>The Alienist</i> and written with scholarly attention to period detail, <b>A Conspiracy of Paper</b> is one of the wittiest and most suspenseful historical novels in recent memory, as well as a perceptive and beguiling depiction of the origin of today's financial markets. In Benjamin Weaver, author David Liss has created an irresistibly appealing protagonist, one who parlays his knowledge of the emerging stock market into a new kind of detective work.</p><p>A fool and his money are soon parted--and nowhere so quickly as in the stock market, it would seem. In David Liss's ambitious first novel, <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i>, the year is 1719 and the place London, where human greed, apparently, operated then in much the same manner as it does today. Liss focuses his intricate tale of murder, money, and conspiracy on Benjamin Weaver, ex-boxer, self-described "protector, guardian, bailiff, constable-for-hire, and thief-taker," and son of a Portuguese Jewish "stock-jobber." Weaver's father, from whom he has been estranged, has recently died, the victim of a horse-drawn carriage hit and run. Though his uncle has suggested that the accident wasn't quite so accidental, Benjamin doesn't give the idea much credence: <blockquote> I blush to own I rewarded his efforts to seek my opinion with only a formal reply in which I dismissed his ideas as nonsensical. I did so in part because I did not wish to involve myself with my family and in part because I knew that my uncle, for reasons that eluded me, had loved my father and could not accept the senselessness of so random a death. </blockquote> But then Benjamin is hired by two different men to solve two seemingly unrelated cases. One client, Mr. Balfour, claims his own father's unexpected death "was made to look like self-murder so that a villain or villains could take his money with impunity," and even suggests there might be a link between Balfour senior's death and that of Weaver's father. His next customer is Sir Owen Nettleton, an aristocrat who is keen to recover some highly confidential papers that were stolen from him while he cavorted with a prostitute. Weaver takes on the first case with some reluctance, the second with more enthusiasm. In the end, both converge, leading him back to his family even as they take him deep into the underbelly of London's financial markets. <p> Liss seems right at home in the world he's created, whether describing the company manners of wealthy Jewish merchants at home or the inner workings of Exchange Alley--the 18th-century version of Wall Street. His London is a dank and filthy place, almost lawless but for the scant protection offered by such rogues as Jonathan Wilde, the sinister head of a gang of thieves who profits by selling back to their owners items stolen by his own men. Though better connected socially, the investors involved with the shady South Sea Company have equally larcenous hearts, and Liss does an admirable job of leading the reader through the intricacies of stock trading, bond selling, and insider trading with as little fuss, muss, and confusion as possible. What really makes the book come alive, however, are the details of 18th-century life--from the boxing matches our hero once participated in to the coffee houses, gin joints, and brothels where he trolls for clues. And then there is the matter of Weaver's Jewishness, the prejudices of the society he lives in, and his struggle to come to terms with his own ethnicity. <i>A Conspiracy of Paper</i> weaves all these themes together in a manner reminiscent of the long, gossipy novels of Henry Fielding and Laurence Stern. Indeed, Liss manages to suggest the prose style of those authors while keeping his own, less convoluted style. This is one conspiracy guaranteed to succeed. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><br>A Conspiracy of Paper, David Liss has woven a tale of eighteenth-century finance, murder, and religion that is a remarkable debut and a<p><br>thoroughly satisfying novel."<br>-Arthur Golden, author of <i>Memoirs of a Geisha</i><br><br>"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A well-researched and highly entertaining historical mystery debut that compares favorably with An Instance of the Fingerpost. Liss's fiendishly intricate tale of financial skulduggery and multiple murder, set in a solidly realized early-eighteenth-century London, has as its redoubtable protagonist and narrator one Benjamin Weaver. . . .

A first novel. Reprint.</p><p>Debra Magpie Earling is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Indian Reservation. She teaches at the University of Montana in Missoula. This is her first novel.*Starred Review* "When Louise White Elk was nine, Baptiste Yellow Knife blew a fine powder in her face and told her she would disappear." So begins a love story of uncommon depth and power, a love story that is as painful as it is transcendent, a love story in which the lovers, like Birkin and Ursula in Lawrence's <i>Women in Love</i>, are unwilling to diminish themselves in the act of joining together but are equally unable to turn away. Set in the years following World War II on the Flathead Indian Reservation in Montana, Earling's superb first novel throws two indomitable characters together in a tightly circumscribed world and gives them free rein to bang into the furniture and each other. A fiery mix of tantalizing contradictions, Louise is a red-haired temptress who yearns to escape the reservation and to experience every kind of freedom on the menu, but she can't avoid her magnetic attraction to Yellow Knife, whose devotion to the old ways and whose shaman-like intensity threaten to shackle Louise even as they offer their own kind of liberation. As they spar with each other--and with Charlie Kicking Woman, a tribal police officer also under Louise's spell--the lovers face both threats and temptations from the white world outside the reservation. Coming-of-age novels set on reservations are a rich part of contemporary literature, of course, and Earling's effort fits securely into the tradition of Welch, Erdrich, and others, but it stands on its own just fine. The Lawrentian psychodrama that emerges from the Louise-Baptiste relationship gives the novel a richness that transcends the story's time and place but that, simultaneously, brings the larger theme of cultural clash into even sharper focus. Let's hope we hear much more from Earling, who is a member of the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes of the Flathead Indian Reservation. <i>Bill Ott</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

And Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, with his suspenseful narrative verse, deceptively simple structure, and powerful images of 19th-century United States, makes an especially suitable subject for the critically acclaimed Poetry for Young People series. Brilliant, specially commissioned artwork brings to life all the atmosphere, drama, and emotion of his writing: the vital energy of "The Village Blacksmith," the urgency of "Paul Revere's Ride," and the sorrow of "The Wreck of the Hesperus." An opening essay tells of Longfellow's life: his childhood in Maine, his family history (the Longfellows played a major role in New England politics), his success as a professor of foreign languages, and his often-tragic personal life. More than just a biography, it reveals the inspiration for many of Longfellow's most popular works. Nearly 30 poems appear, most in their entirety, including "The Arrow and the Song," "The Rainy Day," "Woods in Winter," "The Forest Primeval" (from "Evangeline"), "Hiawatha's Childhood" (from "Song of Hiawatha"), "A Psalm of Life," and the abolitionist "The Witnesses." As always in this series, supplementary word definitions give children the knowledge they need to fully understand the poems. 48 pages (all in color), 8 1/2 x 10. <br></p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

What if we all focused on the powerful idea of <i>ubuntu</i> instead? This transcendent African philosophy embraces the belief that we are universally connected to each other&#x2014;and Shola Richards suggests it could transform the way we treat others, making us kinder and more respectful to others, on and off the job.

His articles have been featured in the Huffington Post, <i>Black Enterprise</i>, and numerous other publications. He lives in Los Angeles, CA.&#x201c;The concept of <i>ubuntu </i>is drawn from the African proverb, &#x2018;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.&#x2019; Though it may seem simple, its execution is tricky, as consultant Richards (<i>Making Work Work</i>, 2016) admits. Today his mission to bring kindness, positivity, and civility to the world&#x2014;a mission he clearly identified in his first book&#x2014;is made even harder by working environments increasingly filled with distrust and suspicion. Nonetheless, he perseveres, explaining his thesis through some powerful anecdotes, such as the story of Jordan, a woman deterred from suicide, thanks to Richards' speech and conversation. Much of his exposition centers on well-developed psychological tenets, such as &#x2018;Self love comes first.&#x2019; Being uncomfortable is but one result of unlocking <i>ubuntu </i>at work. And focus on the things you can control&#x2014;your actions, efforts, and attitudes.

Yank believes that he &#x201c;belongs&#x201d; in his stokehold until a terrified heiress calls him a &#x201c;filthy beast.&#x201d; His rage turns to despair as he encounters a brutally indifferent society onshore.&nbsp;<i>The Great God Brown</i>&nbsp;uses masks to depict the divided souls of its hero, his wife, and his alter ego, the successful businessman William Brown.

In&nbsp;<i>Mourning Becomes Electra</i>, murderous lusts and hatreds wreak havoc upon the proud Mannon family, leaving the survivors pursued not by the avenging Furies of Greek myth but by their own scourging consciences.

With no uniquely American tradition to guide him, O'Neill introduced various dramatic techniques, which subsequently became staples of the U.S. theater. By 1914 he had written twelve one-act and two long plays. Of this early work, only <b>Thirst and Other One-act plays</b> (1914) was originally published. From this point on, O'Neill's work falls roughly into three phases: the early plays, written from 1914 to 1921 (<b>The Long Voyage Home</b>, <b>The Moon of the Caribbees</b>, <b>Beyond the Horizon</b>, <b>Anna Christie</b>); a variety of full-length plays for Broadway (<b>Desire Under the Elms</b>; <b>Great God Brown</b>; <b>Ah, Wilderness!</b>); and the last, great plays, written between 1938 and his death (<b>The Iceman Cometh</b>, <b>Long Day's Journey Into Night</b>, <b>A Moon for the Misbegotten</b>). Eugene O'Neill is a four-time Pulitzer Prize winner, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in literature in 1936.</p><h2>Harp Song for a Radical: The Life and Times of Eugene Victor Debs</h2><p>An extraordinary literary accomplishment, thirty-five years in the making, from the greatly admired author of <b>Miss Macintosh, My Darling</b> ("A work of stunning magnitude and beauty" --<i>New York Times Book Review</i>): a&nbsp;&nbsp;biography of Eugene Victor Debs, the country's first great labor leader.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>To set the stage for her protagonist, in whose struggles she saw acted out all of the conflicted forces that shaped industrial America, and to trace the roots of the American labor and socialist movements, the author opens up a sweep of history and an epic cast of characters. Here are Generals Sheridan and Custer, heroes of the Civil War, fighting the Indians in the West and the workers in the mines, the factories, and on the railroads . . . Alan Pinkerton, the radical weaver from Scotland who came to the New World and created an agency dedicated to destroying labor organizations. Presidents Lincoln, Grant, Cleveland, and Wilson appear. We see the dreamers, the reformers, the crusaders, among them Susan B. Anthony and&nbsp;&nbsp;Sojourner Truth. Here are Henry James Sr., who educated his children according to the tenets of Fourier;&nbsp;&nbsp;James Whitcomb Riley, author of "Little Orphan Annie"; James McNeill Whistler, whose father built a railroad for the czar of Russia; Samuel Gompers, head of the Federation of Labor; the governor of Illinois . . . who refused to call in the army to break the Pullman Strike, or the "Debs Strike" as it came to be called. Men and women, high and low, are caught by the author in the struggle to maintain ideals, in the fight for the rights and dignity of the individual that forged the American identity and ever afterward characterized the American culture.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Marguerite Young takes us into the world of the men who led the American multitudes west before the Civil War--and shows how these pioneers were influenced by the French Revolution's Saint-Simon and Fourier, and then by the German idealists Heinrich Heine, Karl Marx, and Wilhelm Weitling who visited secular and religious settlements across the United States.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>All these threads come together in the life and personality of Eugene Debs: his childhood in Terre Haute, Indiana, in the pastoral America that faded into a distant golden memory after the Civil War, when the town became a center of transportation for industrial expansion. We see Debs finding employment in the railroad yards, becoming caught up in the plight of his fellow workers, editing the union paper, traveling across the country, gathering the knowledge and acquiring the consciousness that inspired him to espouse collective action on behalf of labor, to found the Industrial Workers of the World, and to run as the Socialist candidate for president of the United States five times--three times from prison.<br><br>We see the fierce struggle between the classes--and Debs in the thick of the fight--as the American promise opens up for the men and women in the factories, in the mills, in the stockyards. We see Debs the worker becoming a political leader, becoming a reformer, becoming the voice of the workingman, becoming the founder of American Socialism. Debs, reviled and loved, Debs with the look of a plain man, an austere country doctor, becoming a mythic hero of the age.<br><br> A mesmerizing dual portrait of a man and a century.</p><p>Don't pick up this fascinating, deeply eccentric book expecting to find a conventional biography of Eugene V. Debs (1855-1926). The fiery American labor leader who founded the Socialist Party of America is not so much the subject as the central figure in a group portrait of utopian dreamers--including Karl Marx, Brigham Young, abolitionist Wendell Phillips, poet James Whitcomb Riley, and detective-agency founder Allan Pinkerton--from the time of the French Revolution through the dawn of the 20th century. Author Marguerite Young is a legendary Greenwich Village bohemian who died in 1995. She devoted the last 25 years of her life to this volume, which was intended as a recapitulation of the issues that had engaged Debs--justice for workers, peace for everyone, racial equality--and continued to galvanize America in the 1960s and beyond. Young doesn't provide a lot of straight factual information about Debs's life, but takes instead a snapshot of his soul as it was formed by reading and experience. The narrative closes (sort of) with the national railroad strike of 1877, a bitter defeat for labor that turned railroad worker and union activist Debs toward greater radicalism. Though not a work for the traditionally minded, Young's genre-bending book will thrill students of American social and socialist history. <i>--Wendy Smith</i>Marguerite Young was the author of one novel, <b>Miss MacIntosh, My Darling</b>; two books of poetry, <b>Prismatic Ground</b> and <b>Moderate Fable</b>; and the nonfiction epic <b>Angel in the Forest: A Fairy Tale of Two Utopias</b>. She taught creative writing at Indiana, Columbia, Fairleigh Dickinson, and Fordham Universities, the University of Iowa, and the New School for Social Research. She was born in 1908 in Indiana, lived in New York City for forty-seven years, and, during the last two years of her life, returned to Indianapolis. <b>Harp Song for a Radical</b> began as an essay on Debs and Indiana, and became for Marguerite Young a life-long work. She died before finishing her final editing of the book--a task completed by her friend of many years, Charles Ruas.<br><br>Charles Ruas was born in China, was educated at Princeton University and the Sorbonne and was the recipient of&nbsp;&nbsp;both a Fulbright and a Danforth Fellowship. From 1974 to 1977, he was arts director of the New York radio station, WBAI, where he conducted a program interviewing writers, among them Marguerite Young. Charles Ruas is currently a guest professor of American Literature and Civilization at Stendhal University in Grenoble, France.</p><h2>The Majesty of God&#39;s Law</h2><p>This book is a study of the history and development of the only system of law which was revealed by God, himself.

The author employs familiar characters from Dr. Seuss's "Cat in the Hat" titles to present information showing the diverse range of birds and mammals. The manic parade of rhyming facts, however, is confusing and contrived. Fine Feathered Friends is annoyingly superficial. In Is a Camel a Mammal?, a number of examples prove that mammals come in all sizes, live in many types of environments, and have various eating habits. Two basic facts, however, are mentioned in the glossary but not in the text: that mammal babies feed on their mothers' milk, and that they have backbones. In both books, the cartoon illustrations fail to distinguish among the many creatures.

Such thorough exegetical work lies at the heart of these volumes, which contain detailed verse-by-verse commentary preceded by general comments on each section and subsection of the text.<br><br> An important aim of the NIGTC authors is to interact with the wealth of significant New Testament research published in recent articles and monographs. In this connection the authors make their own scholarly contributions to the ongoing study of the biblical text.<br><br> The text on which these commentaries are based is the UBS <em>Greek New Testament</em>, edited by Kurt Aland and others. While engaging the major questions of text and interpretation at a scholarly level, the authors keep in mind the needs of the beginning student of Greek as well as the pastor or layperson who may have studied the language at some time but does not now use it on a regular basis.</p><p>Dr. Gregory K.

Teasing out an elegant vision of the cosmos as ever-changing yet harmonious, Hinton reveals the seed from which Chinese philosophy, poetry, and painting grew. Although it was and is widely used for divination, the <i>I Ching </i>is also a book of poetic philosophy, deeply valued by artists and intellectuals, and Hinton&#x2019;s translation restores it to its original lyrical form.</p><p> Previous translations have rendered the <i>I Ching</i> as a divination text full of arcane language and extensive commentary. Though informative, these versions rarely hint at the work&#x2019;s philosophical heart, let alone its literary beauty. Here, Hinton translates only the original stratum of the text, revealing a fully formed work of literature in its own right. The result is full of wild imagery, fables, aphorisms, and stories. Acclaimed for the eloquence of his many translations of ancient Chinese poetry and philosophy, Hinton has reinvented the <i>I Ching </i>as an exciting contemporary text at once primal and postmodern.</p></p><p><b>David Hinton</b>&#x2019;s many translations of classical Chinese poetry have earned wide acclaim for creating compelling contemporary poems that convey the actual texture and density of the originals. He is also the first translator in more than a century of the four seminal masterworks of Chinese philosophy: <i>Tao Te Ching</i>, <i>Chuang Tzu</i>, <i>Analects</i>, and <i>Mencius</i>. He has received fellowships from the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Arts, and the National Endowment for the Humanities, and has won the Harold Morton Landon Translation Award, the PEN Translation Prize, and, most recently, the Thornton Wilder Prize for lifetime achievement from the American Academy of Arts and Letters.<p>&#x201c;[The <i>I Ching</i> is] the only thing that is amazingly true, period . . .

He spent most of his young adult life in the outdoors and upon graduation from the University of San Diego he was immediately commissioned as an Officer in the United States Navy and began Navy SEAL training (BUD/S). After several intense tours as a Platoon Commander that had him operating around the world, Cade decided to leave the SEAL teams to pursue other challenges. He was the host of the Spike TV and Discovery Channel show <i>Surviving Disaster</i> and appears as a regular commentator on CNN and Fox News.SEAL Survival Guide <br>EXPAND YOUR COMFORT ZONE<br> <br>You know your current comfort zone, defined as the daily routine you do and the things that make you feel secure, content, and in control. However, most of our daily comfort-zone rituals will leave us unprepared to deal with even the smallest discomfort and will certainly render us incapable of handling an emergency or life-threatening challenge.<br> <br>Challenge Your Limits and Daily Routines<br> <br>Push the boundaries of your comfort zone at least once a day. There are so many opportunities to do this without attempting all at once to become an ultra-marathon runner, although this is a great goal. You must first expand your mind to the possibilities of doing certain things that you previously believed unachievable. Start with small steps and note progress by keeping track; make a list, and check off all the things you do each day to challenge yourself, both physically and mentally. Ultimately, by expanding your comfort zone you will increase both your physical and mental toughness, which are the keys to survival.<br> <br>I believe that if you first focus on changing small things, you can begin the process of thinking differently, and ultimately achieve the goal of acquiring the SEAL mindset of survival, which will allow you to endure anything. You will quickly see that doing things differently makes you think differently. Observe your current routine and then start by doing simple things another way. For example, use the stairs instead of the elevator to take you up only a few floors. Climb at a reasonable pace and know that when you reach the top, you have just expanded your comfort zone. When in your car, don&#x2019;t fight to get the space closest to the store, but purposely look for one that will make you walk. Force yourself to meet three new people and learn at least five things about them. If you have to balance your checkbook, leave the calculator in the desk and make your brain complete this task. Open up the contact list in your phone and memorize five numbers each day. You must seek out ways to expand both mind and body. Start paying attention to how you think about things. If you expand your comfort zone in this manner, you will be better able to do the rest. If you already exercise or jog, for example, increase your distance or speed. Run that extra mile, or run it a minute faster. Do that one additional push-up. Try holding your breath for a minute, and then try two. When in the shower, after scrubbing down with the warm water you usually prefer, finish the last thirty seconds with a blast of cold water. By pushing your physical limits, you are also forcing your brain to expand its comfort boundaries, thus gradually making yourself physically and mentally tougher.<br><br><br> <br><br> <br>Now that I am out of the Navy and getting older every day, I continue to push my comfort zone by engaging in activities I did when I was in SEAL team, including skydiving, shooting, climbing, and long swims. Instead of doing these things in preparation for a mission, I do them not only to maintain these very perishable skills, but also to keep my mind and body sharp&#x2014;I still push the comfort zone and know that this will allow me to be every bit of the warrior I used to be.<br> <br><br><br>Everyone&#x2019;s comfort zone is different, so for some of us, expanding it means starting with drinking one less beer or forgoing dessert. Yet all of these little daily victories will bring us confidence later, especially when our lives depend on it. It&#x2019;s so much easier to do nothing, and it seems natural not to bother, but I tell you: These first exercises are essential in changing your mindset and eventually can be the very things that will separate the survivors from the victims.<br> <br><br> <br>Here is a visualization I use: I like to imagine that pushing my comfort zone daily is similar to rolling a boulder up a hill. If I let it, the rock will always want to tumble back down, and I&#x2019;ll have to start from the bottom again. Expanding the comfort zone on a daily basis will actually make it easier to get that boulder closer to the summit&#x2014;and to our success or ultimate survival.<br> <br>COMFORT ZONE CHECKLIST (all answers need to be yes):<br> <br>&nbsp;Did I challenge myself today?<br> <br>&nbsp;Did I do something positive that my mind initially didn&#x2019;t want to do?<br> <br>&nbsp;Did I do something positive that my body initially didn&#x2019;t want to do?<br> <br>&nbsp;Can I do more?</p><h2>Assessment and Treatment Activities for Children, Adolescents, and Families: Volume One: Practitioners Share Their Most Effective Techniques</h2><p>In this comprehensive resource, highly acclaimed author Liana Lowenstein has compiled an impressive collection of techniques from experienced practitioners.

This <em>Very Short Introduction </em>begins with the Portuguese capture of Africans in the 1400s and traces the development of American slavery until its abolition following the Civil War. Historian Heather Andrea Williams draws upon the rich recent scholarship of numerous highly-regarded academics as well as an analysis of primary documents to explore the history of slavery and its effects on the American colonies and later the United States of America. Williams examines legislation that differentiated American Indians and Africans from Europeans as the ideology of white supremacy flourished and became an ingrained feature of the society. These laws reflected the contradiction of America's moral and philosophical ideology that valorized freedom on one hand and justified the enslavement of a population deemed inferior on another. She explores the tense and often violent relationships between the enslaved and the enslavers, and between abolitionists and pro-slavery advocates as those who benefited from the institution fought to maintain and exert their power. <br><br>Williams is attentive to the daily labors that enslaved people performed, reminding readers that slavery was a system of forced labor with economic benefits that produced wealth for a new nation, all the while leaving an indelible mark on its history.<br><br><strong>About the Series:</strong><br>Oxford's <strong>Very Short Introductions</strong> series offers concise and original introductions to a wide range of subjects--from Islam to Sociology, Politics to Classics, Literary Theory to History, and Archaeology to the Bible.

Do you think Ms. M. Forest and Ms. V. Forest are us?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian gestured at the man in the suit, holding the sign with their names on it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie turned in the direction Vivian was looking and grinned at her mother.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Let's do this, Mom."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian looked around and laughed to herself before she grinned back at Maddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She still didn't exactly know how she'd gotten here. It had all started with a call from Maddie a few weeks ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Hey, Mom, I need an answer fast-do you want to spend Christmas with me in England?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian had laughed. What else was there to do when your thirty-four-year-old daughter asked something so ridiculous?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sure, I do. I also want to spend Thanksgiving with you in Hawaii, New Year's Eve with you in Paris, and Easter with you in Rome."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But Maddie didn't laugh at that.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No, really. I'm serious. You remember my old mentor, Amelia Samuels?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian looked away from her computer screen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The one who's now the stylist for the princess?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Duchess, but yes. Well, Amelia was supposed to go to England at Christmas to help prepare the Duchess for all of the royal Christmas festivities-apparently, there are lots of them-but Amelia is pregnant with twins and just had to go on bed rest. Her doctor says she's under too much stress and can't work at all."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh no, really? Poor Amelia; I didn't know she was pregnant! Please tell her I'm thinking about her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian had only met Amelia once, that time she'd gone down to visit Maddie when she'd been living in L.A., but she'd really liked her. And Amelia had done a lot for Maddie and her own stylist career.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I will, Mom, but let me finish. Since Amelia can't fly to England for Christmas, she wants me to fill in for her, because both she and the Duchess want someone she trusts."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian dropped her pen on the floor.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maddie! Oh my God! Are you serious? My daughter is going to be so famous! You're going to England to work with a princess? You'll be all over People magazine! Oh my God, I can't wait to tell everybody!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You can't tell everybody yet, but I know, I'm blown away. But wait, we can be excited in a second-I want you to come with me."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian got up and closed her office door.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Come with you . . . to England?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie started talking faster.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It means I'll be there for Christmas, and I don't want to be alone with a bunch of strangers at Christmas. I already asked if you could join me, and they said yes. So . . . can you?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian looked around at the piles of work on her desk, and in the direction of her boss's office, with their last conversation about his future-and hers-ringing in her ears.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maddie, I don't know about this-I have a ton of work at this time of year, and today is especially wild around here. What about Theo, did you already talk to him?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian already adored Maddie's boyfriend, Theo, even though they'd only officially been together for a few months.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I told Theo about the offer, yes, and he's thrilled for me. But if you mean did I invite Theo to come to England with me already, absolutely not. I love Theo, and I can't wait to spend New Year's Eve with him, but I've never spent a Christmas without my mother, and I don't intend to start now. So, are you coming?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian grinned to herself. She couldn't deny it warmed her heart to know her daughter still wanted her mom with her for Christmas.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But to go all the way to England for Christmas? That far away from work, the rest of the family, and everything?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'd love to come, but I can't make a decision like this right now," she said to Maddie. "Let me think about it and we can talk about this in a few days."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie's voice got louder.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There's no 'a few days.' I have to make this decision now, and I'm going to decide for both of us. You need this. You haven't gone on a real vacation in years."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>How had she managed to have a daughter who thought she could boss her around like this?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Oh, you have to go. Life is too short not to take incredible opportunities like this! But I don't think I can-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I'm definitely going, and you're definitely coming with me. You never take enough time for yourself; you know I always tell you that. You spend all your time working or helping me or helping out with Aunt Jo. I know you don't want to leave Aunt Jo, but you need a break."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Maddie . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Great, it's settled. Talk to you later!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And with that, Maddie had hung up, and two days later they had plane tickets. Vivian hadn't even known until they were about to board the flight that they were first-class tickets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She laughed to herself just thinking about that flight. The last time she'd been on an airplane, she'd felt lucky to be in an aisle seat. She'd had an aisle seat this time, too-a huge, futuristic, podlike seat, with room not only to stretch her legs, but to lie almost flat. With just a wave, she could summon champagne and snacks to her side, and for all she knew, there was some secret button to give her a massage, too. She and Maddie had spent the first two hours of the flight just looking around and giggling with each other.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Despite how amazing the flight had been, Vivian still wasn't sure she should be here. She was with Maddie, but what about the rest of her family? Her sisters needed her, especially her sister Jo. And she'd never been away from the Bay Area for Christmas in her life. What was Christmas going to be like without her great-aunt Shirley's ham, or her cousin Loretta's greens, or those dinner rolls her cousin Marilyn always said she made but everyone else knew she got at Safeway?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>But then . . . she hated those greens. There was never enough pork in them and way too much vinegar. It might be nice to have a change of pace for Christmas, even though she had serious doubts anyone in England knew how to make a sweet potato pie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The very polite man in the suit escorted them to a waiting SUV, and Vivian and Maddie kept making faces at each other as he offered them three different kinds of bottled water and told them how to turn on their heated seats.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie opened a bottle of water and handed it to Vivian.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's supposed to take a few hours to get there, so . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What?" Vivian stopped her. "A few hours? Where are we going?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Didn't you read the email I sent you about that? The royal family always spends Christmas at Sandringham. It's up in the north of England."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Like she'd had time to read Maddie's lengthy emails. She'd gotten herself packed and to the airport, hadn't she?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I had too much to do in the last few weeks; I had to get ready for a last-minute international trip, remember? Plus, your emails are too long."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie sighed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I should have known. Anyway, Sandringham is a big estate; there are a bunch of royal residences on it, and then lots of trees and land; at least, that's what the pictures online look like. I guess we'll see for ourselves shortly."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian sat back against the plush heated seat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I still can't believe we're really staying with the Duke and Duchess."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie had told her this for the first time about a week ago, and like everything else Maddie had told her about this trip, it sounded as though it couldn't be real.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie shook her head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"I know. The Duchess insisted. She said it would be easier if I was right on-site, and that there's plenty of room in their cottage on the estate for us. When she was so enthusiastic about you joining me, I suspected she was missing her own mom, so I think she's really looking forward to having us there."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This all seemed surreal. Vivian really couldn't believe she was about to meet someone she'd read so much about.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was a social worker from Oakland, for God's sake! How was this happening?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of her job . . .</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"So, I haven't told you this yet," Vivian said to her daughter, "because I wasn't sure if it was really going to happen, but Darren made the announcement before I left the office yesterday: he's retiring. And he wants me to get his job. He first talked to me about it a few weeks ago, and yesterday he brought it up to his boss when I was right there, so I guess he means it."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie screeched.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Mom! Oh my God! I can't believe you're just telling me this now! This is so exciting! What's the title, director of social work?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian nodded slowly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Yep. He's leaving sometime in February, and the hospital director already told me they probably won't get the hiring process started for a few months, so they're going to make me the acting director as soon as Darren retires."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wow." Maddie put her water bottle down and pulled her mom into a hug. "I'm so thrilled for you; this is such great recognition after all of your hard work."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The recognition had felt satisfying, even though she was still in shock about all of this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's true, though it means I'll be jumping into a job with lots of hard work, and I won't get to see patients nearly as much . . . or maybe not at all. But it's a big honor"-she grinned-"and more money."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie settled back against the car seat.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Well, I'm even more glad I made you come on this trip with me. I'm sure you'll take even fewer vacations once you're the big boss."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>That was probably very true. Yes, she was glad she'd come on this trip with her daughter. She hadn't been on vacation-a real vacation, not just a few days off work-in a year and a half. The only other time she'd even been out of the country was that trip she'd taken with her friends to Mexico for her fortieth birthday, and that had been well over ten years ago.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She looked out the car window for her first glimpses of England. The sun was setting already, which surprised her, since they'd landed in the middle of the afternoon. She reminded herself how much farther north London was from the Bay Area, and it was almost the shortest day of the year; of course sunset was this early.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>After about an hour and a half, the car slowed down. She and Maddie peered out the windows into the darkness-they couldn't see much, but it seemed like they were turning off the highway and onto smaller roads. Then the car slowed down even more, and it got darker outside the car windows; the streetlights had seemed to disappear, and all she could see were the outlines of trees. She and Maddie looked at each other with their eyes wide open.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian reached out and grabbed her daughter's hand and squeezed hard.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're going to be great at this."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie nodded.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thanks, Mom. I'm so glad you're here."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian smiled.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Me too."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Just then, the car came to a stop, and the very polite driver leaped out of his seat to open their car doors.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Madam. Madam. Welcome to Sandringham."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian turned to Maddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Deep breaths," she said under her voice, before she turned to get out of the car.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you," Vivian said to the driver. She reached for her carry-on, but before she could pick it up, someone else had come running.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Allow me, ma'am."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>With nothing to carry, she and Maddie turned toward the . . . cottage? Was this a cottage? Oh God. She would have called it a mansion, but then, they did have different words for things in England. She still couldn't remember what they called a bathroom. She was going to have to ask Maddie.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They walked up to the front door, but before they got to the top step, yet another man in a suit opened it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Ms. Forest and Ms. Forest? Welcome."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian and Maddie turned to each other and smiled before walking inside.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>They'd just taken their coats off and handed them to Suit #3, when a woman came down the hall toward them.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You're here! I'm so glad you made it! How was your flight? Was the drive here okay? I know it's so cold outside, but we've made up the fires in your rooms. Would you like a hot buttered rum to warm you up after your trip? Some sandwiches or scones, maybe?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She was smaller in person, but even prettier than she looked on the cover of People magazine. Vivian hoped Maddie would get to find out exactly what her skin care regimen was, because the woman was glowing.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Vivian reached out her hand.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Thank you so much, and thank you for your hospitality. Both the flight and the drive were very easy. And I can't speak for my daughter, but hot buttered rum sounds like a dream come true."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Maddie laughed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"And so do sandwiches and scones."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Duchess ignored Vivian's hand and pulled her into a hug instead.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Wonderful! Let me take you upstairs, show you to your rooms, and let you get freshened up, then you can come down to the sitting room for a little feast. Don't worry; I'm sure you're exhausted. I don't want to keep you up too late. I know how those flights from California to England can be!"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Duchess led them up two flights of stairs, chattering the entire time. Vivian hadn't expected her to be so normal. She'd worried that everything here would be super formal, and she'd have to be on her best behavior for her whole vacation, but the past five minutes had reassured her.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Duchess threw open the doors of two rooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Here are your rooms, and the bathroom is right across the hall." Vivian looked inside; their bags were already in their respective rooms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>And each room really had a fireplace, with a blazing fire. Bedrooms with fireplaces-she was never going to get over this.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The house can get really drafty; that's why I had them make up the fires in there for you. I would have put space heaters in all of the rooms, but I made that mistake early on and blew out the electricity for about half of the palace, and everyone is still talking about it, so I've had to go back to things like fires and lots of throw rugs and hot tea. Just preparing you now so you won't wake up overnight shivering."</p></p><h2>Crazy Sexy Diet: Eat Your Veggies, Ignite Your Spark, And Live Like You Mean It!</h2><p><p><b>The New York Times bestseller, now in paperback!

Iris knows more about the townspeople than she will ever say, and believes her job is to deliver secrets. Yet one day she does the unthinkable: slips a letter into her pocket, reads it, and doesn't deliver it. <br><br> Meanwhile, Frankie Bard broadcasts from overseas with Edward R. Murrow. Her dispatches beg listeners to pay heed as the Nazis bomb London nightly. Most of the townspeople of Franklin think the war can't touch them. But both Iris and Frankie know better... <br><br> <em>The Postmistress</em> is a tale of two worlds-one shattered by violence, the other willfully na�ve&#x2014;and of two women whose job is to deliver the news, yet who find themselves unable to do so. Through their eyes, and the eyes of everyday people caught in history's tide, it examines how stories are told, and how the fact of war is borne even through everyday life.</p><p><strong>Amazon Exclusive: Kathryn Stockett Interviews Sarah Blake</strong> <br><br><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong> was born and raised in Jackson, Mississippi. After graduating from the University of Alabama with a degree in English and Creative Writing, she moved to New York City, where she worked in magazine publishing and marketing for nine years. <em>The Help</em> is her first novel. Here she talks with novelist Sarah Blake about her experiences writing <em>The Postmistress</em>.<br><br> <strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong>: I should start by saying that I am honored to be on the same page with you&#x2014;I loved <em>The Postmistress</em>. The book is so complex, it gives you so much to think about and discuss. My first question to you is, how did the book come about? What made you start writing it? <br><br><strong>Sarah Blake</strong>: Thanks so much, Kathryn&#x2014;and I'd like to lob those kind words right back at you; it's a tremendous thrill for me to be in conversation with the author of <em>The Help</em>. <br><br><em>The Postmistress</em> began with a picture that sprang into my head one day, of a woman sorting the mail in the back of a post office, quietly slipping a letter into her pocket instead of delivering it. Immediately, questions flooded forward: Whose letter was it? Why on earth would she choose to pocket it? What havoc would be wreaked by not delivering a letter? As I answered those questions, Emma and Will and their love story, and the workings of the small town in which Iris was the center, came to life. One hundred pages into that draft, Frankie Bard arrived on the bus, out of the blue. I had no idea who she was or why she was there, except that one character referred to her as a war correspondent without a war. That was interesting, I thought. By this time I had decided to set the novel in the late thirties, early forties. It was 2001 and I was living in Washington, D.C., after the attacks of 9/11, and I was very preoccupied with trying to make sense of what was happening around me. Were we in danger? Would we go to war? The parallels between that uncertain time and the time before the United States entered World War II resonated with me, and what was a novel about accident and fate and the overlapping of lives deepened into a novel with war as its backdrop, which asked questions about how we understand ourselves to be in a historical moment and what we do when we are called to it. <br><br><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong>: Your book features three different women. From a logistical standpoint, did you find it hard to pull off the different points of view? I know this is something I spend a lot of time on in my work&#x2014;making sure the voices are distinct and also very much true to the different characters. <br><br><strong>Sarah Blake</strong>: To be honest, with this novel, the challenge was trying to keep each of these women in line, since each one threatened at some point or another to run away with the story! It took eight years for this story to become the novel you have in your hands, and in large part that's because with the introduction of each character, I found myself going off and following an individual story, traveling further and further from a workable plot. By the time I had finished, I had written three separate novels, one for each of the three women&#x2014;complete with love affairs, whole families, other towns&#x2014;and the challenge came not in trying to keep them distinct, but in trying to figure out how to weave their stories together.<br><br><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong>: Who is your favorite character, and why? <br><br><strong>Sarah Blake</strong>: I'm not sure I can answer that, since there are parts of each of these women I admire, and parts of each of them I don't like. They are all broken in an essential way&#x2014;a way I find incredibly interesting. When a reporter finds she cannot tell a story and a postmaster finds herself unable to pass along a letter, the moments they have arrived at as characters are compelling. Mrs. Cripps was certainly the most fun to write&#x2014;she didn&#x2019;t have to carry too much weight in the telling of the story, and she was such a nosy parker it was fun to write her lines. <br><br><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong>: Is there a character in <em>The Postmistress</em> with whom you identify most? (And if you have been having trysts with good-looking soldiers in dark alleyways, please share!) <br><br><strong>Sarah Blake</strong>: Oh, there are bits of me in all three women: certainly Frankie's rage and sorrow, the desire to get the story (something I despaired of often in the eight years of writing); Iris's love of order; and Emma's feeling of invisibility, her longing for the sense that someone would watch over her. <br><br><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong>: The most haunting scenes for me&#x2014;and there were many&#x2014;were those of Frankie on the train with Thomas and of the mother and child on the train platform. How did these scenes come about? Were they difficult to write? <br><br><strong>Sarah Blake</strong>: Much of the drive to write the book had to do with my own attempt to write my way toward understanding the sudden, final breaks that crack into our lives, in the form of accidents, death, other irrevocable events. I have two sons, and while it is impossible for me to imagine putting them on a train by themselves, with nothing but paper to send them to safety, it was easy to conjure feelings of despair and heartbreak. The book is full of mothers and sons being torn apart by childbirth, bombs, and visas; but the last parting&#x2014;the mother embracing her boy in the train car with Frankie&#x2014;was probably the most difficult to write. It's the hardest to comprehend, and yet it happened all the time, saying good-bye, knowingly, possibly forever. <br><br><strong>Kathryn Stockett</strong>: What research did you do for historical accuracy? You seem to have really nailed the time period. <br><br><strong>Sarah Blake</strong>: Thank you. I'm glad it feels credible. I read many books on the history of World War II, pored through <em>Life </em>magazines from 1939 to 1945 for a sense of how much things cost and what they looked like, read Federal Writers Project interviews with all types of people living on Cape Cod in the 1930s, watched movies made in 1940 and 1941 (my favorite is <em>The Letter</em> with Bette Davis) in order to get the rhythms of idiomatic speech. I also spent many hours at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, and at the Radio &amp; Television Museum in Bowie, Maryland. <p>(Photo of Kathryn Stockett � Kem Lee)</p><b>Sarah Blake</b>&nbsp;is the author of the novels <i>The Guest Book</i>,&nbsp;<i>Grange House</i>,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestseller&nbsp;<i>The Postmistress</i>.

Her twenty-nine-year tenure there included national assignments as well as coverage of aging. In 2008, she launched a blog for the Times called The New Old Age, to which she still contributes. She has taught journalism at the University of California, Berkeley, and at Columbia University, and was the recipient of a John S. Knight Fellowship. She lives in Westchester County, New York.</p>Prologue<br><br>Finding Our Better Selves<br>The day I started writing this book, I spent hours commiserating by telephone with three friends who were being turned upside down by the needs of their aging parents.<br><br>One lived a short distance from her mother, who was in precarious health, bouncing back and forth between home and hospital, unwilling to consider a retirement community or nursing home. For months, without time to rest and regroup, my friend, herself nearing the end of a fatal illness and keeping it from her mother, had managed a series of medical and home care emergencies. She was running on empty.<br><br>The second friend, rocked by the financial strains and childrearing conflicts that often follow divorce, had largely abdicated to his siblings the demands of long-distance supervision of two increasingly disabled parents, one lost in the fog of Alzheimer&#x2019;s disease and the other plagued by stress pain and the broken bones of osteoporosis. When my friend tried to do his fair share of the work, he was overwhelmed. When he didn&#x2019;t try, he was conscience-stricken.<br><br>The third friend was considering making a cross-country move to be closer to his mother, who was then past ninety and losing her customary verve. Driving had become risky, and her once-daily walks to the store or the library were just too much sometimes, now that simply dressing or preparing meals took so much energy. My friend knew his mother needed more from him than three-times-a-day phone calls. And he wanted more from her as their time together dwindled.<br><br>Before that day was over, I had also spoken to each friend&#x2019;s mother, as I do regularly, since all of them are dear to me. What they had to say, unbidden, was the flip side of my earlier conversations with their children. These three strong-willed old women were grateful for their children&#x2019;s devotion but resistant to giving up the reins. They were embarrassed by their own diminished capacity and frightened of what lay ahead, but nothing was worse, they said, than being a burden. Like my mother, who died in 2003, they fought dependence, even as it became inevitable.<br><br>All of my conversations served as a fitting reminder that we stand at an unprecedented demographic crossroads. Never before have there been so many Americans over the age of eighty-five. Never before have there been so many Americans in late middle age, the huge baby boom cohort, responsible for their parents&#x2019; health and well-being. Most often, neither the aged parents nor the adult children are prepared for this long, oft en tortured, time in life, or for these role reversals, which are unanticipated, unwelcome, and unfamiliar. How do we become our parents&#x2019; parents without robbing them of their dignity? How do they let us? How do we collaborate with our siblings, leaving behind any baggage we may have with them, or manage on our own if we are only children?<br><br>The task is to get through it with grace, mindfulness, and good sense: to do the very best we can for our parents without sacrificing the lives we&#x2019;ve built for ourselves&#x2014;our families, our jobs, and our own fi nancial future, which is the last thing they&#x2019;d want us to do. But how do we know when it&#x2019;s still appropriate to aggressively pursue medical care, try to fix everything that&#x2019;s broken, and restore our parents to a measure of health, vitality, and dignity? How do we know when, logistically and financially, we must break a solemn promise not to &#x201c;put them away&#x201d; (and how do we forgive ourselves for doing it, if we must)? How do we know when the time for heroics has passed? Our parents may have escaped earlier threats to their health&#x2014;strokes, cardiac events, cancer&#x2014;and lived longer than any generation before them, but eventually some things are just going to wear out. Their death certificates will say they died of heart failure or diabetic complications or respiratory failure, because the government has decreed that &#x201c;old age&#x201d; is not an acceptable cause of death. I beg to differ. At a certain point, the wheels simply fall off the bicycle.<br><br>So here we are, not just with a herculean job but with a front-row seat for this long, slow dying. We want to do all we realistically can to ease the suff ering, smooth the passing, of our loved ones. But we also have the opportunity to watch what happens to our parents, listen to what they have to say to us, and use that information to look squarely at our own mortality and prepare as best we can for the end of our own lives. In fact, we have the opportunity to become better people, wiser and stronger, not simply older and grayer. We can make something of this crisis, or we can endure the experience until it&#x2019;s over and then escape back into the daily buzz of our lives until suddenly it&#x2019;s our turn.<br><br>That is what this book is about: how we get through this time, no matter how long it lasts. It is written from the far shore of caregiving, an allconsuming and life-altering experience that wrings you out, uses you up, and then sends you back into the world with your heart full and your eyes open, if you let it. First and foremost it is my own story&#x2014;mine, my mother&#x2019;s, and my brother&#x2019;s&#x2014;the one I know best. But it will be amplified and enriched, at every turn, by the people I&#x2019;ve interviewed on this subject over the years as part of my job for <i>The New York Times</i>&#x2014;the elderly, their adult children, professionals in the fi eld&#x2014;and more recently by the hundreds of thousands of monthly readers of the blog I launched for the Times, called<i> The New Old Age</i>, the first such forum for two intersecting generations finding their way through a timeless challenge but never before experienced in these daunting new ways or in these numbers.<br>Although my caregiving days are behind me, they are vivid still. In the space of three years, between 2000 and 2003, my mother&#x2019;s ferocious independence gave way to utter reliance on her two adult children. Garden-variety aches and pains became major health problems; halfh earted attention no longer sufficed, and managing her needs from afar became impossible. The time had come for my mother&#x2019;s reverse migration, from a retirement community in Florida to another in New York, and in short order to a nursing home. By the end of her life, at eighty-eight, she was paralyzed, incontinent, could not speak, was losing the ability to swallow, and wanted nothing so much as a dignifi ed way to die.<br><br>Those are the bare-bones facts. Missing is the panic of being in charge; and the shock to my brother, Michael, and me when our competence and resources proved all but useless in the face of America&#x2019;s incoherent and inadequate safety net for the frail elderly. We were flattened by the enormous demands on our time, energy, and bank accounts; the disruption to our professional and personal lives; the fear that our time in this parallel universe would never end and the guilt for wishing that it would. I can tell you now that it was worth every dreadful minute, a transformative experience. But at the time, living in the eternal present tense, all we could manage was muddling from one day to the next.<br><br>My brother and I were late children, so we reached this juncture before our friends and colleagues, who, innocent of experience, telegraphed the belief, painful to us, that we were exaggerating how awful it was. Only occasionally did they say it out loud, but in the silence between sentences I could hear judgment: <i>This can&#x2019;t be as hard as you&#x2019;re making it sound. Old people get sick and die all the time. This isn&#x2019;t your child, or your spouse, or yourself. It&#x2019;s inevitable.</i><br><br>It was a lonely time. I was too tired and too sad for socially appropriate chitchat; I emptied the room at cocktail parties with gloom-and-doom stories nobody wanted to hear and quickly found it easier to just stay home. My brother, luckily, seemed to cross more easily between these disparate worlds in which we found ourselves.<br><br>At work, I tried to keep pace with my job while fi elding my mother&#x2019;s incessant phone calls, chasing down doctors, phoning in prescriptions, hiring geriatric care managers and aides, arguing with my brother, fighting back tears, and dashing out of the newsroom for emergencies. Had I been a parent, I might have been just as stressed, but part of my energies would have been invested in a child&#x2019;s bright future. Old people may have good days, and it was my job to maximize those for my mother, but they don&#x2019;t have bright futures.<br><br>Among my somewhat younger friends and colleagues, the fear and confusion I remember has now become commonplace. I hear it from behind the partitioned cubicles at work, in weary discussions on the train platform or in the supermarket checkout line, at business meetings with people I barely know. A total stranger confides his feelings of guilt at letting his sister do all the heavy lift ing. Another, ashamed, says he recoiled when shaving his father for the fi rst time. A third is at her wit&#x2019;s end because her parents, usually frugal coupon clippers, have for months been paying rent at an assisted living facility but still refuse to leave their home. A fourth cannot aff ord home care for his mother and wants her to end her days in his house but wonders at the eff ect on his children.<br><br>The same day that I tried to console my three friends, and their mothers, I had an appointment with my internist, who spent half the visit telling me about her mother&#x2019;s ups and downs since her move to a continuing care retirement community. When I spoke to my literary agent, whose father was in failing health and would die within months, she was passing the caregiver&#x2019;s baton to her brother on the eve of an overseas vacation. Colleagues wanted to know the cost of a home health aide, an explanation as to why adult diapers fit women better than men, and product reviews for medical alert pendants and staircase chair-lifts. I also bumped into a neighbor whose mother-in-law, recently widowed, was no longer talking to her. With the best of intentions and a clear head, my neighbor had invited a geriatric social worker to help open a difficult family dialogue. Her mother-in-law was enraged. The list goes on.<br><br>So what did I have to off er the dozen-plus people who had shared their heartache with me in the space of a single day (and not an atypical one in that regard)? And, more pertinent, what do I have to offer you? Alas, not a comprehensive rule book for being your parent&#x2019;s parent; I don&#x2019;t believe there is such a thing, not one that tells the truth. If there had been, I assure you I would have found it and read it when I needed it most.<br><br>But I can share with you my hard-earned list of tips that you won&#x2019;t fi nd in the growing collection of how-to books and websites. I can describe my mistakes and triumphs&#x2014;I hope in a constructive way&#x2014;as well as make other suggestions, things for you to do or at least think very hard about, regardless of the fact that no two families face the same issues. <br><br>I can tell you, from experience, that if you take charge too soon, you will patronize and humiliate your parents, but if you step in too late, their manageable problems will have turned unmanageable. I will try to give you advice for determining when the right time has arrived. I can tell you how to initiate family discussions if your parents or siblings prefer to avoid them and how to participate in such conversations even if you&#x2019;d rather not. I can tell you that most bad decisions are made in the heat of a crisis, when alarm and ignorance collide. I can tell you that it is usually possible to slow things down&#x2014;refuse to be rushed by doctors, discharge planners, and others who have different agendas than yours&#x2014;and demand the time to consider alternatives calmly and deliberately.<br><br>I can tell you how to work out a fair division of labor with siblings whose hearts are in the right place but who are not hardwired to help in certain ways. I can tell you how to appreciate assistance when you get it, how to conserve energy by avoiding unproductive resentment when you don&#x2019;t, and how to relax exacting standards that guarantee nothing anyone else does will be good enough. I can make suggestions about looking aft er yourself so you don&#x2019;t fall apart when someone else needs you, having learned the hard way. And I can ask uncomfortable questions about whether your insistence on doing everything, your way and with less help than is available, is about solving real problems, satisfying your ego, or settling old scores.<br><br>I can tell you what various entitlement programs pay for, and what they don&#x2019;t; which situations are covered by long-term care insurance, and which aren&#x2019;t; and why workplace accommodations designed for child care don&#x2019;t help much when you&#x2019;re caring for an elderly parent. I can tell you when it might be wise to avoid specialists, who are trained to cure and consider anything less a failure, and instead search for a primary care doctor with an interest in geriatrics&#x2014;the biology, physiology, sociology, and psychology of the elderly. Among other things, geriatricians know the difference between quality of life and quantity of life, and can explore with an elderly parent, and with you, where to draw that line.<br><br>I can tell you to stay out of emergency rooms and hospitals to the extent possible and never to leave your parents there to fend for themselves. I can tell you that taking an elderly person for a single test&#x2014;say, an MRI&#x2014;is generally an all-day aff air, so it&#x2019;s a bad idea to tell your boss you&#x2019;ll be back after lunch. I can tell you to leave a spare pair of glasses in the car; to keep the gas tank full and the driveway shoveled; to always carry your cell phone charger; and to maintain an updated list of your parents&#x2019; medications. All of this will prepare you best for dealing with inevitable emergencies.<br><br>I can tell you not to be impressed by grand marble staircases in assisted living communities, which are too slippery and steep for the elderly ever to use; these decorative flourishes are there to reassure you that you&#x2019;ve moved Mom or Dad to a nice place and needn&#x2019;t feel bad about it. Better you should ask if there&#x2019;s anyone with medical training around aft er six at night. And I can tell you that the rude sounds and smells of a nursing home, which assault you the first time you cross the threshold, will likely become less depressing over time, and that they count for less than the number of registered nurses or the turnover among aides; more important, they will be less disturbing to your parents than to you because old people are at a different, more accepting place, or will be soon.<br><br>I can tell you all of these things and more. But the most important thing I can tell you is that being clueless&#x2014;utterly clueless&#x2014;is the central and unavoidable part of this experience, perhaps the greatest challenge to those of us who pride ourselves on knowing what we&#x2019;re doing, who like being in control. Th at&#x2019;s because every decision&#x2014;medical, residential, financial, personal&#x2014;is contingent on the particular trajectory of your parent&#x2019;s decline. I can&#x2019;t tell you how your mother or father will die, how long it will take, how much suff ering it will involve, what it will cost, how you will pay for it, what will happen to your career or your marriage in the meantime, or whether the experience will bring your family together or pull it apart. All of that depends on imponderables, things you can&#x2019;t know or prepare for no matter how smart you are, how organized, or how loving and attentive.<br><br>So even more important than seeking and dutifully following prescriptive advice, in my experience, is learning to roll with the punches, to play without a net. To some, improvisation comes naturally. To me, it didn&#x2019;t. I hated it when my elaborate plans went awry. And I beat myself up over &#x201c;bad&#x201d; decisions when there really was no such thing, given th...</p><h2>Asterix Omnibus 9</h2><p><p>This special collector's edition features books 25 to 27 in one fabulous volume, in paperback for the first time. </p><p>In ASTERIX AND THE GREAT DIVIDE, can Asterix, Obelix and Getafix ensure a happy ending for star-crossed lovers Melodrama and Histrionix, whose fathers are rival chieftains?

In April 1945, victorious Soviet forces encircled 80,000 men of the German 9th Army in the Halbe area, South of Berlin, together with many thousands of German women and children. The German troops, desperate to avoid Soviet capture, battled furiously to break out towards the West, where they could surrender to the comparative safety of the Americans. For the German civilians trapped in the Kessel, the quest to escape took on frantic dimensions, as the terror of Red Army brutality spread. The small town of Halbe became the eye of the hurricane for the breakout, as King Tigers of the SS Panzer Corps led the spearhead to the West, supported by Panthers of the battle-hardened 21st Panzer Division. Panzer by panzer, unit by unit, the breakout forces were cut down &#x2013; until only a handful of Panthers, other armour, battered infantry units and columns of shattered refugees made a final escape through the rings of fire to the American lines. This first-hand account by the commander of one of those Panther tanks relates with devastating clarity the conditions inside the Kessel, the ferocity of the breakout attempt through Halbe, and the subsequent running battles between overwhelming Soviet forces and the exhausted Reich troops, who were using their last reserves of fuel, ammunition, strength and hope. Eloquent German-perspective accounts of World War 2 are surprisingly rare, and the recent reissue of Wolfgang Faust&#x2019;s 1948 memoir &#x2018;Tiger Tracks&#x2019; has fascinated readers around the world with its insight into the Eastern Front. In &#x2018;The Last Panther,&#x2019; Faust used his unique knowledge of tank warfare to describe the final collapse of the Third Reich and the murderous combat between the German and Russian armies. He gives us a shocking testament to the cataclysmic final hours of the Reich, and the horrors of this last eruption of violence among the idyllic forests and meadows of Germany.</p><p>The rarely-heard voice of a World War 2 panzer crewman, now in a modern English translation.</p><h2>Encyclopedia of Animals: Contains 300 species!</h2><p>Plunge into the diversity of the animal kingdom in this <i>Encyclopaedia of&nbsp;Animals</i>.

At least they had a lovely April day for the walk, sunny and pleasant, with only a few puffy clouds overhead.<br><br>Claire McKnight, Alex's best friend and now sister-in-law, was the first one inside. She moved past the new double-sided river-rock fireplace that separated what would be the reception area from the first-floor dining room.<br><br>Claire whirled around to take in the walls, peeled back to bare brick, the original wood flooring and the intact fire pole that descended from the second-floor dining area that used to be the sleeping quarters of the old firehouse, back in the days when Hope's Crossing was a rough and rowdy mining town.<br><br>"What a fantastic space," Claire exclaimed. "I'll admit, I was more than a little nervous when you told me Brodie and Jack were cooking up this idea. I mean, this old place has been an eyesore in town forever! I thought they should have torn it down years ago. Now that I see the renovations, my mind is racing with possibilities."<br><br>"I know, right?" Alex beamed at Claire and her other friends and several family members gathered beside them.<br><br>"Pure genius to replace the fire-truck doors with that big sliding wall of windows," Charlotte Caine exclaimed, her pretty features alight. "What an incredible view of Woodrose Mountain and downtown. You can see everything from here."<br><br>"I know. And on summer days, we can roll the windows to the side and make the whole thing a big outdoor space.<br><br>"Oh, darling. This is fantastic," her mother exclaimed. Mary Ella squeezed her hand, and Alex was so glad she had brought them to the restaurant for the quick tour and an impromptu picnic dinner to take care of the Bites part of their Books and Bites name.<br><br>"Brodie is so excited about Brazen." Evie Thorne tucked a strand of long blond hair behind her ear. "I haven't seen him this enthusiastic about a project in a long time."<br><br>"Jack really did a fantastic job with the design," Mary Ella said, looking around.<br><br>"Of course he did. He's Jackson Lange." The wife of the man in question smiled with a contentment Alex never thought she would see again on her older sister's features, after the hellish time two years ago. She owed Jack so much. The creative architectural genius that had gone into designing this space was the very least of her debts to him.<br><br>She smiled at this group of women she loved dearly. "I'm am indeed blessed to have friends and sisters who are not only brilliant and talented in their own rights, but who also have the good taste to marry well...so I don't have to."<br><br>As she might have expected, her words earned a laugh from nearly everyone except her mother. Alex didn't miss the spark of worry in her mother's eyes behind their trendy little glasses.<br><br>She ignored it, as she customarily did. She wasn't going to let her mother's concern bother her. Not when she was so relieved at their excited reaction to the restaurant, even at this embryonic stage.<br><br>"Thank you for walking all the way up the hill for lunch today. As a reward, you get to be the first to enjoy a meal here at Brazen, of sorts. I packed a picnic for us. It seemed appropriate, given the infamous picnic in this month's selection."<br><br>"I still say we should have picked <em>Pride and Prejudice</em> instead of <em>Emma.</em> Mr. Darcy is a much sexier hero than Mr. Knightley," Brodie's mother, Katherine, opined, a distinct gleam in her eyes.<br><br>"We read P and P two years ago, remember?" Mary Ella reminded her. "Alex made that fantastic white soup and the trifles."<br><br>"I do hope you don't have pigeon pies and cold lamb in that hamper you lugged all the way up here," Alex's oldest sister, Angie, said.<br><br>"How do you remember what they ate at the picnic in <em>Emma?"</em> Charlotte asked with a laugh.<br><br>Angie grinned. "I'm all about the food. You should know that by now."<br><br>"No pigeon or lamb. Boring cold fried chicken, potato salad and fruit. But I do have pie. And other things."<br><br>She pulled open the large hamper, reached inside for the blanket and spread it out on the wooden floor. "Sorry we don't have tables and chairs yet. They're on order but won't be here for another few weeks. If you prefer not to sit on the floor, you can sit on the stairs. Katherine, Mom, Ruth, you three can sit on the hearth ledge."<br><br>"Perfect," Katherine Thorne declared.<br><br>Alex set the dishes out in the middle of the blanket, and for the next few moments, everyone in the book club was busy filling plates.<br><br>This had been a crazy idea to bring them here for the picnic. They all would have been far more comfortable back at Dog-Eared Books &amp; Brew, Maura's shop, but Alex had been dying to show everyone the progress.<br><br>"You must be so excited for the restaurant to open," Janie Hamilton, one of their newer members, said around a mouthful of chicken salad sandwich.<br><br>"I can't wait," Alex said, though she declined to add that part of her also quaked with fear, if she let it.<br><br>Running her own restaurant had been her dream since she first decided to go to culinary school. Now that the opening date was drawing closer and the dream was quickly on its way to becoming reality, raw anxiety warred with her anticipation, the fear that she didn't really have the necessary skills and creativity to make Brazen shine amid the crowded Hope's Crossing restaurant scene.<br><br>"As far as I can tell, only one small detail is missing," Angie said.<br><br>"What's that?" Mary Ella asked.<br><br>Her sister scanned the open space again. "Maybe I'm missing something but, um, where's the kitchen?"<br><br>"Oh, my word, you're right," Janie exclaimed. "There's no kitchen!"<br><br>"Where's your brilliant architect of a husband now?" Katherine teased Maura. "He left out the most important part."<br><br>"Yeah, yeah," Alex said, though she felt a stab of nerves. She needed a kitchen! "It's coming. Another three weeks, according to Brodie. The contractor who has done most of the rehab work so far had a medical emergency in his family and Brodie had to hire someone else to finish up."<br><br>"Sam Delgado," Evie said. "He's worked with Brodie before on some projects closer to Denver. I've met him a few times. He's really nice."<br><br>"I don't care how nice he is. I just want him to get his butt in gear and finish the kitchen so I can start stocking it and we can set an opening."<br><br>That uncertainty was just one of the worries keeping her up at night. After years of being a sous-chef in someone else's kitchen, she finally had the opportunity to prove herself. As owner and developer of the restaurant, Brodie was giving her this chance, and she couldn't afford to blow it.<br><br>She would be fine, she assured herself again. She was hardworking and talented and had years of experience under her white toque. What else did she need?<br><br>"I read something once that said nine in ten new restaurants close in the first year," Ruth Tatum said, wiping a napkin daintily at the corners of her mouth.<br><br>"Mom." Claire grimaced.<br><br>"What? I did."<br><br>Alex was quite used to Ruth's pithy comments, since she had practically grown up with Claire, but the words and the pessimism behind them still stung. "That's actually a myth," she was quick to point out. "The actual number is about one in four in the first year. Closer to three in five after about three years."<br><br>Yet another worry that kept her up at night. How would she face everyone in town who believed in her if she couldn't make Brazen a success?<br><br>"This place is going to be one of the restaurants that makes it," Mary Ella declared loyally. "Assuming you do get a kitchen and don't have to cook everything on a barbecue grill out back."<br><br>Alex sighed. "For now, you're going to have to use your imagination about the kitchen. Trust me when I tell you it's going to be fantastic. I've gone over the plans with Jack and Brodie. You've all seen Brodie's other restaurants in town. I'm sure you can guess this one is going to have state-of-the-art everything."<br><br>"So when will we actually be able to eat here?" Maura asked.<br><br>"You're eating now," she retorted. "A particularly delicious chopped spinach salad, if I do say so myself."<br><br>Her sister made a face. "That's not what I meant, Alexandra. When is Brazen supposed to open?"<br><br>She firmly ignored the flutters in her stomach. "Near the end of May but before Memorial Day weekend. We wanted to have a few weeks to work out the kinks before the summer tourist season hits."<br><br>"That doesn't give you much time, if the contractor still needs three weeks to finish the kitchen," Ruth pointed out, helpful as always.<br><br>"Yes, I know. He's supposed to be coming to town this weekend. It won't be soon enough for me."<br><br>"He'll be here," Evie assured her. "And I promise, you'll love the job he does."<br><br>She still couldn't believe the single most important component of her new restaurant wasn't complete. The previous contractor should have started in the kitchen and worked out from there, as far as she was concerned.<br><br>"Don't worry. Everything's going to be fantastic," Claire assured her. "Everyone knows what a brilliant chef you are. You're going to have people lined up from here to Silver Strike Canyon, waiting for your food."<br><br>She loved Claire dearly for her unwavering faith but had to take it with more than a grain of salt. Claire would probably bite her own tongue off before she would say anything that might be construed as even a sprinkle or two on Alex's parade.<br><br>"Thanks, hon."<br><br>To her relief, the conversation shifted away from the restaurant and on to the reason they ostensibly met, the book they had read that month. They discussed the mismatches in the book, Emma's strong and sometimes un-likeable personality, how different she was from many Austen heroines.<br><br>By the time the lively discussion trickled out and the conversation shifted again to gossip around town, most of the book club members had moved on to dessert.<br><br>"Charlotte, how's your brother?" Mary Ella asked into a rare lull.<br><br>Charlotte set down the sugar-free cookie Alex had specially fixed for her. Whenever she fixed a meal for the book club, she tried to remember that the candystore owner was very aware of each bite after losing nearly eighty pounds over the past year.<br><br>"He's coming home, finally."<br><br>"Oh, I hadn't heard!" Katherine exclaimed. "That's wonderful news."<br><br>Charlotte didn't look as if she completely agreed but she gave a forced-looking smile. "He was officially released from Walter Reed several months ago but he stayed in the area for rehab. Dad will be happy to have him home."<br><br>Much to Alex's amusement, Katherine looked a little flustered at the mention of Dermot Caine, who owned the Center of Hope Cafe in town. The two of them shared a mutual crush but so far neither had done anything about it.<br><br>Dermot would certainly take good care of his son's nutrition needs, but Alex still made a mental note to add Dylan Caine to her informal list of food deliveries. The cafe served good, hearty comfort food, but a war hero like Dylan deserved gourmet fare once in a while.<br><br>"We'll have to throw a barbecue for him or something," Mary Ella said.<br><br>Charlotte shook her head quickly. "He would hate that. He's very...different from the Dylan you all probably remember. He will barely talk to any of us."<br><br>Charlotte came from a family as large as Alex's, though she was the only girl in a household of boys, while Alex had four sisters and only one brother, Claire's husband, Riley.<br><br>"I guess I should get back to the bookstore," Maura said. "Jack has Henry this afternoon over at his office and he's probably ready for a nap."<br><br>"Who? Jack or Henry?" Mary Ella asked.<br><br>"Both. Definitely."<br><br>Maura's adopted son was just about the most adorable ten-month-old Alex knew, but he was already turning into a handful.<br><br>"I need to go, too," Claire said. "We left Hannah in charge of String Fever while we were gone. She has such a soft heart, she just might give away half my inventory."<br><br>Alex had to swallow a laugh at the irony of Claire worrying about anyone else's soft heart when she was renowned for her overwhelming generosity.<br><br>"I really do love your place, Alex," she said.<br><br>"Same goes," Maura said, kissing her cheek. Alex almost wanted to cry to see her sister's obvious happiness, when she thought Maura would never be able to find joy again.<br><br>"We're all coming on opening night. Just try to keep us away," Katherine added.<br><br>Her friends gathered up their things, and Alex watched as they all began heading down the hill toward downtown.<br><br>Her mother was the last to leave. Mary Ella hugged her hard, surrounding her with the familiar scent of flowers and fabric softener. "I love this place, darling. It's so good to see you happy."<br><br>She drew away from her mother's embrace. "What are you talking about? I'm always happy."<br><br>"Are you?"<br><br>She wasn't in the mood for her mother's concern today. "Yes. I'm so happy, I beam with it. I'm a freaking glow stick. Why wouldn't I be?"<br><br>Annoyance flickered in Mary Ella's green eyes that she had passed on to each of her children.<br><br>"The restaurant is going to be wonderful. I just...hope it's everything you want."<br><br>"It will be," she said firmly.<br><br>"You know I worry about you."<br><br>"Because I'm not happily married, you mean, like everybody else, and cranking out grandbabies for you."<br><br>She meant her tone to sound flippant but she had a strong feeling she sounded prickly and sensitive instead.<br><br>Mary Ella stiffened. "That's not what I'm talking about."<br><br>She didn't want to get into this right now with her mother, not after their lovely book club meeting. She adored Mary Ella and admired her greatly for pulling the shattered pieces of her life together and moving on so many years ago, but sometimes her mother had very decided tunnel vision on some topics.<br><br>"Are you sure? Lila and I are the last ones standing, now that Riley and Maura have taken the leap, and Lila's too far away in California for you to meddle with."<br><br>"Do I meddle?" Mary Ella asked, her tone mild but her eyes flashing.<br><br>That wasn't fair to her mother, she knew. "No," she admitted. "But I know you would like to see me settled in a relationship like everybody else."<br><br>"Only if that's what you want. I don't care if you never marry, Alex. I've spent the last twenty years of my life single and thought I would remain that way for the rest of it. I certainly never expected Harry Lange to come blustering in."<br><br>She was glad Harry made Mary Ella happy, for reasons she still didn't understand, but that didn't mean she wanted to discuss her mother's love life.<br><br>"You can stop worrying about me, Mom. I have nearly everything I want."<br><br>"Nearly...</p><h2>Within Reach: My Everest Story (Nonfiction)</h2><p>In May 1996 the media scrambled to document the gripping story of sixteen-year-old <b>Mark Pfetzer</b>'s expedition to Mount Everest. Not only was he the youngest climber ever to attempt the summit, he also witnessed the tragedy documented in <b>Jon Krakauer</b>'s <b>Into Thin Air</b>, in which eight climbers perished in a sudden storm. <b>Within Reach</b> is Mark's extraordinary account of this experience and of his triumphs over several other challenging peaks. At once triumphant and tragic, this story will be an inspiration to climbers, athletes, and armchair enthusiasts alike.</p><p>Although <i>Within Reach</i> is targeted at young adults and written in a young man's voice, the writing (by coauthor Galvin) is engaging, and the story is rewarding enough to interest any mountaineer.<p> Pfetzer, 18 at the time of publication, describes his summits of a number of peaks worthy of a climber twice his age, including Huascar�n, Aconcagua, Ama Dablam, Kilimanjaro, and Cho Oyu. He tells at length of his two expeditions to Everest, where he reached 25,000 feet from Tibet and 26,000 feet from Nepal. Purists may sneer, as all these climbs were commercial, guided expeditions--but heck, the kid was only 14 or 15; how else would he get there? And, though a paying client, he was unusually well prepared: a karate black belt (at age 11), courses in NOLS (National Outdoor Leadership School) and high-angle rescue, full EMT (emergency medical technician) training (even though he was too young to be licensed), in addition to being in top physical condition, which he rigorously maintained.</p><p> Pfetzer has regularly sought out older, more experienced mountaineers as mentors--somewhat rare for a teenager--and thanks them publicly for their teaching and wisdom. His love of climbing and determination to succeed are inspirational for all ages. <i>--Donna DeShazo</i></p><b>Mark Pfetzer</b> is a well-known inspirational speaker and personality in the sports world.

The heart of the story is the mass migration that took place between 1880 and 1924, when a whole culture left its ancient roots to settle in the cities and towns of America.</p><p>A rich, humane, well-researched discourse on Italians in America, by Mangione (An Ethnic at Large, 1978, etc.) and Morreale (Monday, Tuesday...Never Come Sunday, 1977). By marshalling abundant, striking, and unexpected facts, the authors create a fresh view of the Italian contribution to American culture. Amerigo Vespucci emerges as an ambiguous hustler, while the forgotten Fillipo Mazzei comes alive as a man at the heart of the birth of our nation--friend of and influence upon Italophile Thomas Jefferson and ``prime mover in founding and organizing a constitutional society whose members included James Madison, James Monroe, and Edmond Randolph.'' Equally memorable is Count Luigi Cesnola, Union officer and Confederate prisoner, art dealer and first director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art. The brutal realities of turn-of-the-century immigration and of the melting-pot squalor of the resulting Italian ghettos are portrayed matter-of- factly, but the authors also explore little-known Italian-American outposts in Louisiana (where their communes prospered), Texas (where immigrants were ripped even off more outrageously than usual), and even in Arizona, where N.Y.C.'s future mayor Fiorella La Guardia spent some formative years. It all adds up to a powerful look at a heritage often overwhelmed by the dominant Anglo culture, and to a strong antidote to the mafia-mythology so dear to the media. The facts are all here, but what makes the book hum are a vigor and tone unique to writers tempered in the liberal-left tradition of the Thirties, for whom humanity and social issues are truly of the essence. (Thirty-two pages of b&amp;w photos--not seen.) -- <i>Copyright �1992, Kirkus Associates, LP. All rights reserved.</i>The core of this gripping, panoramic chronicle is the mass emigration of Italians to the U.S. between 1880 and 1924. Their road to assimilation was marked by hard work, family solidarity, tradition-laden weddings and joyous festivals, but also by poverty, miserable housing, dangerous working conditions and marriages that "often seethed with tensions" despite a public image of unity and warmth. Mangione ( Mussolini's March on Rome ) and Morreale ( A Few Virtuous Men ) trace discrimination against Italian Americans, arguing that politicians and the media fanned prejudice after WW II by resurrecting the Mafia image of the 1890s. They discuss Italian Americans' awareness or denial of their heritage, providing cameos of Sacco and Vanzetti, Fiorello LaGuardia, Frank Sinatra, Don DeLillo, John Ciardi, Francis Coppola and dozens more. Early chapters discuss Italian adventurers (such as Columbus) and Italians who fought in the American Revolution and the Civil War; a later one touches on intermarriage and divorce, which have contributed to the decline of immigrant culture. A magnificent saga that illuminates a century of accomplishment and struggle.

Shackleton had originally planned to sail his ship, the Endurance, through the Weddell Sea to the South American side of the continent, land on the coast, and then march a team of five men, supported by dogs and sledges, to the South Pole and then onto the Ross Sea on the side closest to Australia. Completing this mission would make the explorer the first to cross the entire continent. In the context of other Antarctic expeditions, this achievement held out the promise of enduring fame for Shackleton and glory for Great Britain.<br> <br>But in late January 1915, pack ice had locked the Endurance about eighty miles from land, holding the ship and her crew hostage to the drifting floes; by October, the currents had carried the boat almost seven hundred miles north and west. The floes&#x2014;large masses of floating ice, some weighing several tons&#x2014;alternately broke apart and came back together in the ocean&#x2019;s mighty swells. Caught in this shifting mosaic, the wooden ship creaked and groaned under the immense pressure. It seemed only a matter of time before the Endurance would succumb and sink.<br> <br>Toward the end of October, the ice suddenly rose and fell, driving the vessel starboard (rightward) to a thirty-degree tilt. The ship righted itself when the ice loosened some. But in the ensuing days, the floes continued to press on the hull, opening planks on the ship&#x2019;s sides. Crew members manned the pumps round the clock as they tried to stanch the inflowing water. The captain, Frank Worsley, still hoped the Endurance might break free of the moving pack and sail into open water. But Shackleton was less optimistic and made plans to move the men and supplies onto the ice. &#x201c;A strange occurrence was the appearance of eight Emperor [penguins],&#x201d; Worsley noted in his diary on October 26. After issuing a few ordinary cries, he wrote, the birds &#x201c;proceeded to sing what sounded like a dirge for the ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>The next day, the ice intensified its assault on the Endurance, squeezing her like a vise. The vessel was &#x201c;in her death agony,&#x201d; wrote the expedition&#x2019;s surgeon, Alexander Macklin, in his diary. &#x201c;It was a pitiful sight. To all of us she seemed like a living thing&#x2014;we had sworn at her and cursed her antics in a seaway, but we had learned to love her as we now realised, and it was awful to witness her torture.&#x201d; Late that afternoon, Shackleton ordered his men to abandon ship and take refuge in tents on the shifting ice floe. That night, the temperature fell to -15� Fahrenheit (-26� Celsius).<br> <br>While the men tried to sleep amid the vessel&#x2019;s cracking timbers, Shackleton paced the ice. He thought about the dying ship. He took stock of his men and options for getting them all home alive. Like other leaders in a crisis, Shackleton understood that achieving his mission depended critically on how he managed himself&#x2014;mentally, emotionally, and physically. He realized that the path ahead was likely to be long and arduous, and as he later remembered, &#x201c;an ordered mind and a clear programme were essential if we were to come through without loss of life.&#x201d;<br> <br>Early the next morning, Shackleton, his second-in-command, Frank Wild, and expedition photographer Frank Hurley prepared hot powdered milk for breakfast. As the men emerged from their tents, Shackleton gathered them round and announced a new goal: &#x201c;ship and stores have gone&#x2014;so now we&#x2019;ll go home.&#x201d; He did so &#x201c;without emotion, melodrama or excitement,&#x201d; Macklin remembered, even though &#x201c;it must have been a moment of bitter disappointment&#x201d; for the leader. He&#x2019;d &#x201c;lost his ship, and with her any chance of crossing the Antarctic Continent.&#x201d; As always with him, Macklin added, &#x201c;what had happened had happened: it was in the past and he looked to the future.&#x201d; A day later, in the privacy of his own diary, Shackleton was more candid about the challenge ahead. He knew that circumstances had altered his mission from one of exploration to one of survival. &#x201c;A man must shape himself to a new mark directly the old one goes to ground,&#x201d; he wrote. &#x201c;I pray God, I can manage to get the whole party to civilization.&#x201d;<br> <br>From his Antarctic experience, Shackleton knew that one of the most important tools he had in accomplishing his mission was his presence. How he showed up each day in front of his men&#x2014;what kind of energy he gave off, how determined he looked, even how he carried his body&#x2014;had a huge impact on the team. He used what we would today call his emotional intelligence to maintain his determination and bravery; when these flagged, he never let his men know.<br> <br>This is an important lesson for our time. Leaders often forget that all eyes are on them&#x2014;as they give a speech, sit in a meeting, walk down a hallway, or glance furtively at their smartphone during dinner. This is especially true when the volatility of a situation increases. In these moments, people instinctively look to leaders, searching their words, actions, and body language for guidance. This means that individuals in positions of authority must learn to embody their mission not only in what they say and do, but also in how they show up. When a leader appears assured and levelheaded, others are more likely to respond to the call.<br> <br>As the forty-one-year-old commander worked to exude confidence, he kept his men&#x2019;s focus trained on the task ahead. It was no use considering what had been lost or what might have been; the new goal was to get everyone home safely. The morning after abandoning ship, Shackleton announced the team would march across the pack ice toward a former explorer&#x2019;s base on Snow Hill Island, some three hundred miles northwest. He estimated the men could walk five to seven miles a day. He was sure that when they arrived there, they would find emergency stores cached by past expeditions. From Snow Hill Island, the commander and a smaller party would travel an additional 130 miles west to Deception Island, where whaling ships were known to dock.<br> <br>The trek across the broken ice would be difficult for a group hauling two of the ship&#x2019;s three lifeboats, food supplies, and other stores. But Shackleton was in a hurry to get his team moving, partly to improve the men&#x2019;s morale. &#x201c;It will be much better for the men in general to feel that even though progress was slow,&#x201d; he noted privately, &#x201c;they are on their way to land, than it will be simply to sit down and wait for the tardy north-westerly drift to take us out of this cruel waste of ice.&#x201d; A second reason of Shackleton&#x2019;s for taking action now was to avoid damage to the lifeboats; this might occur if the men waited for open water and ended up sailing in choppy seas amid shifting icebergs.<br> <br>On October 30, 1915, three days after evacuating the Endurance, the men set out for Snow Hill Island. Some hauled the lifeboats, others drove dog teams pulling supplies. The long, plodding caravan headed away from the ship and the site the men called Dump Camp. The team moved at a crawl, owing to their heavy loads and the difficulty of moving across uneven ice&#x2014;a landscape defined by jagged ridges and huge blocks as far as the eye could see. After two tedious hours, the men had traveled only a mile. They were exhausted. The next two days were worse, and on the third day, November 1, Shackleton called off the march.<br> <br>The twenty-eight men had traveled less than four miles toward their destination. The commander knew that at the current pace, their supplies would give out long before they reached Snow Hill Island. He ordered the men to move their gear to a solid ice floe not far from the battered ship. Shackleton planned to have the men camp there while he considered his next move.<br> <br>On November 21, 1915, the commander saw what remained of the Endurance sinking through the ice. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s going, boys!&#x201d; he shouted, and the men quickly clambered out of their tents to watch. &#x201c;There was our poor ship a mile and a half away struggling in her death-agony,&#x201d; a crew member recorded in his diary. &#x201c;She went down bows first, her stern raised in the air. She then gave one quick dive and the ice closed over her forever.&#x201d; A strange silence fell over the camp. With the ship gone, the men could see nothing but ice, extending endlessly in all directions. There was no line on the horizon, no sign whatsoever of the outside world. Without the Endurance, one man wrote, &#x201c;our destitution seems more emphasized, our desolation more complete.&#x201d; Shackleton himself was stunned by the ship&#x2019;s sinking. He recorded the event only briefly in his diary, adding, &#x201c;I cannot write about it.&#x201d;<br> <br>The leader knew there was no hope of rescue. Not only were the men seven hundred miles northwest of where he&#x2019;d originally planned to build base camp, but he&#x2019;d also told family and colleagues not to expect any communication from him before early 1916. The leader understood that he&#x2019;d have to get the crew to safety on his own, and he knew how difficult this would be.<br> <br>Shackleton had been to Antarctica twice before. The first time, as a member of the British National Antarctic Expedition (1901&#x2013;4), he&#x2019;d come close to death&#x2014;a result he attributed as much to the team&#x2019;s weak commander as to the continent&#x2019;s harsh conditions. The second time, he&#x2019;d led his own expedition (1907&#x2013;9). His crew hadn&#x2019;t achieved its objective of discovering the South Pole, but he&#x2019;d learned a great deal about himself and his authority. He knew that cohesion, including the men&#x2019;s faith in themselves and their leader, was as important to survival as adequate nutrition. Shackleton also understood that as the head of the expedition, he was responsible for these elements. Now, in 1915, against extraordinary odds, he had to advance his mission and keep his men believing they could achieve it with him.<br> <br>How exactly was the explorer going to accomplish his goal? How was he to keep his own courage and confidence levels high to feed those of his men? In November 1915, as the Endurance sank and the ice closed over her, the answers to these questions were anything but clear. What Shackleton did know was that he was committed to bringing all his men home alive, and he was willing to do whatever it took to accomplish this. In the midst of disaster, he&#x2019;d made a conscious choice to lead. He was all-in, and his story offers up key leadership lessons for moments when disaster strikes.</p><h2>Behold the Beauty of the Lord: Praying With Icons</h2><p>This twentieth anniversary edition (more than 111,000 copies sold) brings Henri J.M. Nouwen&#39;s writings on Eastern Orthodox icons to a new generation and adds to the Nouwen collection published by Ave Maria Press. With a foreword by Br. Robert Lentz, a well-known painter of contemporary icons, this classic Nouwen book invites readers to pray with four Russian icons with their eyes open by emphasizing seeing or gazing, which are at the heart of Eastern spirituality. Nouwen&#39;s meditations reveal his viewing of the icons not as decorations, but holy places. The book includes four full-color icons, which can be removed for private contemplation or meditation.</p><p><b>Henri J. M. Nouwen</b> is one of the most popular spiritual writers of our time. He wrote more than forty books, among them the bestselling <i>Out of Solitude</i>. He taught at the University of Notre Dame, as well as Yale and Harvard Universities. From 1986 until his death in 1996, he was part of the L'Arche Daybreak community in Toronto, where he shared his life with people with mental disabilities.<br><br><b>Robert Lentz, O.F.M.</b>, a Franciscan friar, is one of the best-known contemporary icon painters in North America. His work has been shown around the world, has appeared on the covers of many books and magazines, and is featured with the text of Joan Chittister's book, <i>A Passion for Life: Fragments of the Face of God</i>. He lives in Silver Spring, Maryland.Henri J. M. Nouwen, who wrote more than 40 books, remains one of the most popular spiritual writers of our time. This paperback is a revised version of a volume released in 1987.<br><br>We are assaulted by images in a society where consumerism comes at us through posters, billboards, television, movies and store windows. But icons are a different thing completely. Nouwen presents meditations on four icons: the icon of the Holy Trinity, the icon of the Virgin of Vladimir, the icon of the Savior of Zvenigorod, and the icon of the Descent of the Spirit:<br><br>"By giving the icons long and prayerful attention talking about them, reading about them, but mostly just gazing at them in silence I have gradually come to know them by heart. I see them now whether they are physically present or not. I have memorized them as I have memorized the Our Father and the Hail Mary, and I pray with them wherever I go."<br><br>Icons are a part of the sacred liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church and are used in worship services. Nouwen points out that they do not excite our outer senses but speak to our heart. Those who gaze at icons as a spiritual practice believe they draw closer to God in the process. Nouwen presents substantive spiritual analysis of the icon of the Holy Trinity, which he sees as a pathway into the Mystery of God's self-revelation. The icon of the Virgin of Vladimir is an invitation to enter the divine milieu with gratitude and joy. Nouwen sees in the eyes of the icon of the Savior of Zvenigorod a revelation about the mystery of the Incarnation. And, finally, in the icon of the Descent of the Holy Spirit, he feels a celebration of the power and meaning of community. Nouwen concludes:<br><br>"Working on these meditations has been a great delight. Praying became writing and writing became praying. More energy was granted than consumed in the process. I fervently hope that you who read these meditations will experience some of this same delight, and thus deepen your desire to behold the beauty of the Lord expressed in these holy images." --<b>Frederic and Mary Ann Brussat</b>, spiritualityandpractice.com</p><h2>Parkinson&#39;s Disease: 300 Tips for Making Life Easier</h2><p><p>An indispensable resource for patients, families, and caregivers</p> <p>Filled with creative tips and techniques, this updated second edition of <i>Parkinson's Disease: 300 Tips for Making Life Easier</i> contains a wealth of ideas and shortcuts for working, organizing, simplifying, and conserving time and energy while living with Parkinson's disease.

Heart-Healthy classic dishes, regional favorites, and inspired innovations, <i>The Greek Vegetarian</i> pays tribute to one of the world's most venerable and healthful cuisines that play a major component in the popular <i>Mediterranean Diet</i>.</p></p><p>In Ithaca, the villagers so revere the olive that they give names to the olive trees that bear them. We're not talking upstate New York here, but Greece, the land that gave us rosy-fingered dawns and spanakopita. Diane Kochilas gives us the Greek way with vegetables in <i>The Greek Vegetarian</i>, and she should be given some kind of humanitarian award for the effort. For anyone fussing over increasing greens, vegetables, and grains while reducing the place of meat in the usual American diet, <i>The Greek Vegetarian</i> is a place of comfort and repose, a place to settle back in the sun and flip through the pages and let the deliciousness of all these wonderful food ideas lap over your life like warm waves from the Aegean Sea. <p> There are 100 recipes herein, and they come from the traditions of Greek cuisine. No one is stretching just to make a dish vegetarian (oh, OK: there's one recipe for vegetarian souvlaki). Only recently have Greeks gained the dubious title of biggest meat eaters in Europe, and even then all they did, according to the author, was make their plates bigger for the added meat. They still eat a diet rich in vegetables. Always have; always will.</p><p> But some specifics. Kochilas divides her book into Meze, the little dishes of Greece, and Main Meals, the pastas, soups, stews, casseroles, savory pies and breads, the egg dishes. There's Beet and Apple Salad with a Yogurt Dressing, for starters. How about Roasted Eggplant and Chickpea Salad? Or Arugula Salad with Wrinkled Olives and Orange Slices? The Classic Greek Bean Soup is included. So too is a dish of Potatoes Stewed with Kalamata Olives. The possibilities build, one upon the other. This book bursts with flavor the same way a vine-ripened, sun-warmed tomato bursts at the first bite. It will dribble down your chin if you're not careful. <i>--Schuyler Ingle</i></p>"Delicious and lively...Here is the rare cookbook I'd like to cook my way through, front to back." --Michelle Huneven, <i>Los Angeles Times</i><p> "This is the loveliest cookbook imaginable, full of splendid recipes and lore, and moreover just shining with Diane Kochilas's intelligent passion for the cuisines of Greece." --Nancy Harmon Jenkins, author of <i>The Mediterranean Diet Cookbook</i></p><p> "<i>The Greek Vegetarian</i> is an important book, because it brings together a broad spectrum of vibrant, healthy, delicious dishes. Diane Kochilas manages to cover a lot of Greek territory here, yet she never leaves us behind." --Martha Rose Shulman, author of <i>Mediterranean Light</i> and <i>Mexican Light</i></p><p> "A gifted storyteller and inspired cook, Diane Kochilas has brought the heart, soul, and spirit of the Greek table to us.

The sun burns there, the wind whispers, all is in motion, too slow for the eye but more certain than sight. The prophet said sand is neither kind nor cruel, but in the oven of the Sahar it is hard to think that it does not hate you.<br><br>Tahnoon&#x2019;s back ached, his tongue scraped dry across the roof of his mouth. He rode, hunched, swaying with the gait of his camel, eyes squinting against the glare even behind the thin material of his shesh. He pushed the discomfort aside. His spine, his thirst, the soreness of the saddle, none of it mattered. The caravan behind him relied on Tahnoon&#x2019;s eyes, only that. If Allah, thrice-blessed his name, would grant that he saw clearly then his purpose was served. <br><br>So Tahnoon rode, and he watched, and he beheld the multitude of sand and the vast emptiness of it, mile upon baking mile. Behind him, the caravan, snaking amid the depths of the dunes where the first shadows would gather come evening. Around its length his fellow Ha&#x2019;tari rode the slopes, their vigilance turned outward, guarding the soft al&#x2019;Effem with their tarnished faith. Only the Ha&#x2019;tari kept to the commandments in spirit as well as word. In the desert such rigid observance was all that kept a man alive. Others might pass through and survive, but only Tahnoon&#x2019;s people lived in the Sahar, never more than a dry well from death. Treading the fine line in all things. Pure. Allah&#x2019;s chosen. <br><br>Tahnoon angled his camel up the slope. The al&#x2019;Effem sometimes named their beasts. Another weakness of the tribes not born in the desert. In addition, they scrimped on the second and fourth prayers of each day, denying Allah his full due.<br><br>The wind picked up, hot and dry, making the sand hiss as it stripped it from the sculpted crest of the dune. Reaching the top of the slope, Tahnoon gazed down into yet another empty sun-<br><br>Hammered valley. He shook his head, thoughts returning along his trail to the caravan. He glanced back toward the curving shoulder of the next dune, behind which his charges laboured along the path he had set them. These particular al&#x2019;Effem had been in his care for twenty days now. Two more and he would deliver them to the city. Two more days to endure until the sheikh and his family would grate upon him no longer with their decadent and godless ways. The daughters were the worst. Walking behind their father&#x2019;s camels, they wore not the twelve-yard thobe of the Ha&#x2019;tari but a nine-<br><br>yard abomination that wrapped so tight its folds barely concealed the woman beneath. <br><br>The curve of the dune drew his eye and for a second he imagined a female hip. He shook the vision from his head and would have spat were his mouth not so dry.<br><br>&#x201c;God forgive me for my sin.&#x201d;<br><br>Two more days. Two long days.<br><br>The wind shifted from complaint to howl without warning, almost taking Tahnoon from his saddle. His camel moaned her disapproval, trying to turn her head from the sting of the sand. Tahnoon did not turn his head. Just twenty yards before him and six foot above the dune the air shimmered as if in mirage, but like none Tahnoon had seen in forty dry years. The empty space rippled as if it were liquid silver, then tore, offering glimpses of some place beyond, some stone temple lit by a dead orange light that woke every ache the Ha&#x2019;tari had been ignoring and turned each into a throbbing misery. Tahnoon&#x2019;s lips drew back as if a sour taste had filled his mouth. He fought to control his steed, the animal sharing his fear.<br><br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; A whisper to himself, lost beneath the camel&#x2019;s complaints.<br><br>Revealed in ragged strips through rents in the fabric of the world Tahnoon saw a naked woman, her body sculpted from every desire a man could own, each curve underwritten with shadow and caressed by that same dead light. The woman&#x2019;s fullness held Tahnoon&#x2019;s eye for ten long heartbeats before his gaze finally wandered up to her face and the shock tumbled him from his perch. Even as he hit the ground he had his saif in hand. The demon had fixed its eyes upon him, red as blood, mouth gaping, baring fangs like those of a dozen giant cobras. <br><br>Tahnoon scrambled back to the top of the dune. His terrified steed was gone, the thud of her feet diminishing behind him as she fled. He gained the crest in time to see the slashed veil between him and the temple ripped wide, as if a raider had cut their way through the side of a tent. The succubus stood fully displayed and before her, now tumbling out of that place through the torn air, a man, half-naked. The man hit the sand hard, leapt up in an instant, and reached overhead to where the succubus made to pursue him, feeling her way into the rip that he&#x2019;d dived through headfirst. As she reached for him, needle-like claws springing from her fingertips, the man jabbed upward, something black clutched in his fist, and with an audible click it was all gone. The hole torn into another world&#x2014;gone. The demon with her scarlet eyes and perfect breasts&#x2014;gone. The ancient temple vanished, the dead light of that awful place sealed away again behind whatever thinness keeps us from nightmare.<br><br>&#x201c;Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!&#x201d; The man started to hop from one bare foot to the other. &#x201c;Hot! Hot! Hot!&#x201d; An infidel, tall, very white, with the golden hair of the distant north across the sea. &#x201c;Fuck. Hot. Fuck. Hot.&#x201d; Pulling on a boot that must have spilled out with him, he fell, searing his bare back on the scalding sand and leaping to his feet again. &#x201c;Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!&#x201d; The man managed to drag on his other boot before toppling once more and vanishing head over heels down the far side of the dune screaming obscenities. <br><br>Tahnoon stood slowly, sliding his saif back into its curved scabbard. The man&#x2019;s curses diminished into the distance. Man? Or demon? It had escaped from hell, so demon. But its words had been in the tongue of the old empire, thick with the coarse accent of northmen, putting uncomfortable angles on every syllable.<br><br>The Ha&#x2019;tari blinked and there, written in green on red across the back of his eyelids, the succubus stretched toward him. Blinked again, once, twice, three times. Her image remained, enticing and deadly. With a sigh Tahnoon started to trudge down after the yelping infidel, vowing<br><br>to himself never to worry about the scandalous nine-yard thobes of the al&#x2019;Effem again.</p><br><p>One</p><br><p>All I had to do was walk the length of the temple and not be seduced from the path. It would have taken two hundred paces, no more, and I could have left Hell by the judges&#x2019; gate and found myself wherever I damn well pleased. And it would have been the palace in Vermillion that I<br><br>pleased to go to.<br><br>&#x201c;Shit.&#x201d; I levered myself up from the burning sand. The stuff coated my lips, filled my eyes with a thousand gritty little grains, even seemed to trickle out of my ears when I tilted my head. I squatted, spitting, squinting into the brilliance of the day. The sun scorched down with such unreasonable fierceness that I could almost feel my skin withering beneath it. &#x201c;Crap.&#x201d;<br><br>She had been gorgeous though. The part of my mind that had known it was a trap only now struggled out from under the more lustful nine tenths and began shouting &#x201c;I told you so!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Bollocks.&#x201d; I stood up. An enormous sand dune curved steeply up before me, taller than seemed reasonable and blazing hot. &#x201c;A fucking desert. Great, just great.&#x201d;<br><br>Actually, after the deadlands even a desert didn&#x2019;t feel too bad. Certainly it was far too hot, eager to burn any flesh that touched sand, and likely to kill me within an hour if I didn&#x2019;t find water, but all that aside, it was alive. Yes, there wasn&#x2019;t any hint of life here, but the very fabric of the place wasn&#x2019;t woven from malice and despair, the very ground didn&#x2019;t suck life and joy and hope from you as blotting paper takes up ink.<br><br>I looked up at the incredible blueness of the sky. In truth a faded blue that looked to have been left out in the sun too long but after the unchanging dead-sky with its flat orange light all colours looked good to my eye: alive, vibrant, intense. I stretched out my arms. &#x201c;Damn, but it&#x2019;s<br><br>good to be alive!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Demon.&#x201d; A voice behind me.<br><br>I made a slow turn, keeping my arms wide, hands empty and open, the key thrust into the undone belt struggling to keep my trews up. <br><br>A black-robed tribesman stood there, curved sword levelled at me, the record of his passage down the dune written across the slope behind him. I couldn&#x2019;t see his face behind those veils they wear but he didn&#x2019;t seem pleased to see me.<br><br>&#x201c;As-salamu alaykum,&#x201d; I told him. That&#x2019;s about all the heathen I picked up during my year in the desert city of Hamada. It&#x2019;s the local version of&#x201c;hello.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You.&#x201d; He gestured sharply upward with his blade. &#x201c;From sky!&#x201d;<br><br>I turned my palms up and shrugged. What could I tell him? Besides any good lie would probably be wasted on the man if he understood the Empire tongue as poorly as he spoke it.<br><br>He eyed the length of me, his veil somehow not a barrier to the depth<br><br>of his disapproval.<br><br>&#x201c;Ha&#x2019;tari?&#x201d; I asked. In Hamada the locals relied on desert-born mercenaries to see them across the wastes. I was pretty sure they were called Ha&#x2019;tari.<br><br>The man said nothing, only watched me, blade ready. Eventually he waved the sword up the slope he&#x2019;d come down. &#x201c;Go.&#x201d;<br><br>I nodded and started trudging back along his tracks, grateful that he&#x2019;d decided not to stick me then and there and leave me to bleed. The truth was of course he didn&#x2019;t need his sword to kill me. Just leaving me behind would be a death sentence.</p><br><p>Sand dunes are far harder to climb than any hill twice the size. They suck your feet down, stealing the energy from each stride so you&#x2019;re panting before you&#x2019;ve climbed your own height. After ten steps I was thirsty, by halfway parched and dizzy. I kept my head down and laboured up the slope, trying<br><br>not to think about the havoc the sun must be wreaking on my back.<br><br>I&#x2019;d escaped the succubus by luck rather than judgment. I&#x2019;d had to bury my judgment pretty deep to allow myself to be led off by her in any event. True, she&#x2019;d been the first thing I&#x2019;d seen in all the deadlands that looked alive&#x2014;more than that, she&#x2019;d been a dream in flesh, shaped to promise all a man could desire. Lisa DeVeer. A dirty trick. Even so, I could hardly have claimed not to have been warned, and when she pulled me down into her embrace and her smile split into something wider than a hyena&#x2019;s grin and full of fangs I was only half-surprised.<br><br>Somehow I&#x2019;d wriggled free, losing my shirt in the process, but she&#x2019;d have been on me quick enough if I hadn&#x2019;t seen the walls ripple and known that the veils were thin there, very thin indeed. The key had torn them open for me and I&#x2019;d leapt through. I hadn&#x2019;t known what would be waiting for me, nothing good to be sure, but likely it had fewer teeth than my new lady friend.<br><br>Snorri had told me the veils grew thinnest where the most people were dying. Wars, plagues, mass executions . . . anywhere that souls were being separated from flesh in great numbers and needed to pass into the deadlands. So finding myself in an empty desert where nobody was likely to die apart from me had been a bit of a surprise.<br><br>Each part of the world corresponds to some part of the deadlands&#x2014;wherever disaster strikes, the barrier between the two places fades. They say that on the Day of a Thousand Suns so many died in so many places at the same time that the veil between life and death tore apart and has never properly repaired itself. Necromancers have exploited that weakness ever since.<br><br>&#x201c;There!&#x201d; The tribesman&#x2019;s voice brought me back to myself and I found we&#x2019;d reached the top of the dune. Following the line of his blade I saw down in the valley, between our crest and the next, the first dozen camels of what I hoped would be a large caravan.<br><br>&#x201c;Allah be praised!&#x201d; I gave the heathen my widest smile. After all, when in Rome . . .</p><br><p>More Ha&#x2019;tari converged on us before we reached the caravan, all black-robed, one leading a lost camel. My captor, or saviour, mounted the beast as one of his fellows tossed him the reins. I got to slip and slide down the dune on foot. By the time we reached the caravan the whole of its length had come into view, a hundred camels at least, most laden with goods, bales wrapped in cloth stacked high around the animals&#x2019; humps, large storage jars hanging two to each side, their conical bases reaching almost to the sand. A score or so of the camels bore riders, robed variously in white, pale blue or dark checks, and a dozen more heathens followed on foot, swaddled beneath mounds of black cloth, and presumably sweltering. A handful of scrawny sheep trailed at the rear, an extravagance given what it must have cost to keep them watered.<br><br>I stood, scorching beneath the sun, while two of the Ha&#x2019;tari intercepted the trio of riders coming from the caravan. Another of their number disarmed me, taking both knife and sword. After a minute or two of gesticulating and death threats, or possibly reasoned discourse&#x2014;the two tend to sound the same in the desert tongue&#x2014;all five returned, a white-robe in the middle, a checked robe to each side, the Ha&#x2019;tari flanking. <br><br>The three newcomers were bare-faced, baked dark by the sun, hook-nosed, eyes like black stones, related I guessed, perhaps a father and his sons.<br><br>&#x201c;Tahnoon tells me you&#x2019;re a demon and that we should kill you in the old way to avert disaster.&#x201d; The father spoke, lips thin and cruel within a short white beard.<br><br>&#x201c;Prince Jalan Kendeth of Red March at your service!&#x201d; I bowed from the waist. Courtesy costs nothing, which makes it the ideal gift when you&#x2019;re as cheap as I am. &#x201c;And actually I&#x2019;m an angel of salvation. You should take me with you.&#x201d; I tried my smile on him. It hadn&#x2019;t been working recently but it was pretty much all I had.<br><br>&#x201c;A prince?&#x201d; The man smiled back. &#x201c;Marvellous.&#x201d; Somehow one twist of his lips transformed him. The black stones of his eyes twinkled and became almost kindly. Even the boys to either side of him stopped scowling. &#x201c;Come, you will dine with us!&#x201d; He clapped his hands and barked something at the elder son, his voice so vicious that I could believe he&#x2019;d just ordered him to disembowel himself. The son rode off at speed. &#x201c;I am Sheik Malik al&#x2019;Hameed. My boys Jahmeen.&#x201d; He nodded to the son<br><br>beside him. &#x201c;And Mahood.&#x201d; He gestured after the departing man.<br><br>&#x201c;Delighted.&#x201d; I bowed again. &#x201c;My father is . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tahnoon says you fell from the sky, pursued by a demon-whore!&#x201d; The sheik grinned at his son. &#x201c;When a Ha&#x2019;tari falls off his camel there&#x2019;s always a demon or djinn at the bottom of it&#x2014;a<br><br>proud people. Very proud.&#x201d; <br><br>I laughed with him, mostly in relief: I&#x2019;d been about to declare myself the son of a cardinal. Perhaps I had sunstroke already. <br><br>Mahood returned with a camel for me. I can&#x2019;t say I&#x2019;m fond of the<br><br>beasts but riding is perhaps my only real talent and I&#x2019;d spent enough time lurching about on camelback to have mastered the basics. I stepped up into the saddle easy enough and nudged the creature after Sheik Malik as he led off. I took the words he muttered to his boys to be approval.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll make camp.&#x201d; The sheik lifted up his arm as we ...</p></p><h2>The Dual Disorders Recovery Book: A Twelve Step Program for Those of Us with Addiction and an Emotional or Psychiatric Illness</h2><p><b>This compelling <i>Dual Disorders Recovery Book</i>, written for those with an addiction and a psychiatric illness, provides a source of information and support throughout recovery.</b><br><br>Personal stories offer experience, strength, and hope as well as expert advice.

The mere thought of singing in front of a crowd makes my stomach twist into knots.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you&#x2019;re such a good singer,&#x201d; Soojin insists.<br> <br>I pause, enjoying the praise for a second. Soojin is the only one at school who knows I can sing, and she thinks I&#x2019;m amazing at it. Every Tuesday we argue about the best contestant on The Voice and who deserves to advance to the next round. I can count on Soojin to end the conversation by saying that I&#x2019;m better than most of the people on the show, and that I deserve to be on it someday. But what she doesn&#x2019;t consider is that if by some miracle I was standing in front of the judges and live studio audience, I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to croak out a word. I shake my head again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come on, Amina. Just try it.&#x201d; Soojin is a little louder now.<br> <br>&#x201c;Girls, is that chatter about you volunteering?&#x201d; Ms. Holly stares at us from the front of the classroom with her eyebrows raised.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ouch!&#x201d; I yelp. It&#x2019;s Soojin&#x2019;s pencil in my side again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Is that a yes, Amina? Should I sign you up for a solo for the concert?&#x201d; Ms. Holly asks. &#x201c;How about one of the Motown pieces from the 1970s?&#x201d;<br> <br>I sink lower into my chair as everyone stares at me and stumble over my words. &#x201c;Um, no, thank you. I&#x2019;ll just stay in the chorus,&#x201d; I finally manage to mutter.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay.&#x201d; Ms. Holly shrugs, a frown clouding her face until Julie Zawacki, waving her hand like an overenthusiastic first grader, distracts her. Julie always wants the spotlight and tends to sing extremely loudly. It&#x2019;s as if she thinks volume makes up for her lack of pitch. I always wonder how the math class next door gets any work done whenever Julie starts belting. But I still wish I had even half the guts she does.<br> <br>&#x201c;Remember, we&#x2019;ve only got two months to prepare for the Winter Choral Concert. This is a big deal, guys,&#x201d; Ms. Holly calls out as the bell rings and we file out for lunch.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you didn&#x2019;t sign up,&#x201d; Soojin complains as we sit down at what has already become our usual spot in the lunchroom three weeks into the school year. &#x201c;This is your big chance to finally show everyone what you&#x2019;ve been hiding.&#x201d;<br> <br>I&#x2019;m pretty sure that was what Adam, the judge with sleeve tattoos, said to the tall redheaded girl on The Voice last Sunday night, and I tell her that.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious,&#x201d; Soojin says. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s time to forget about John Hancock.&#x201d;<br> <br>Just the mention of that name brings back the memories I&#x2019;ve tried to block since second grade: our class play about American independence. I was John Hancock and was supposed to say one line: &#x201c;I will proudly sign my name in big letters.&#x201d; But when it came time for the performance, I looked out into the audience, saw the sea of faces, and froze. There was this endless moment when the world grew still and waited for me to speak. But I couldn&#x2019;t open my mouth. My teacher, Mr. Silver, finally jumped in and said my line for me, with a joke about how John Hancock had lost his voice but was going to sign his name extra big to make up for it. The audience laughed and the show went on while I burned with humiliation. I can still hear Luke and his friend jeering at me from the side of the stage.<br> <br>&#x201c;That was forever ago! We&#x2019;re in sixth grade now. You need to get over it.&#x201d; Soojin sighs as if my entire middle school future depends on performing a solo in Ms. Holly&#x2019;s Blast from the Past production. I don&#x2019;t let her see how much I agree with her and how badly I want the spot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway, do you think I look like a Heidi?&#x201d; she continues.<br> <br>I have a mouthful of sandwich and stare at her as I chew, relieved that she&#x2019;s changed the subject. I try to imagine her with a name I associate with Swiss cartoon characters or a famous supermodel&#x2014;not my twelve-year-old Korean best friend.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not really,&#x201d; I finally say after swallowing. &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What about Jessica? Do I look like a Jessica?&#x201d; Soojin picks carrots out of an overstuffed sandwich wrapped in white deli paper.<br> <br>&#x201c;No. What are you talking about?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I got it.&#x201d; Soojin sits back and crosses her arms. She&#x2019;s hardly reassembled her sandwich and it&#x2019;s already half gone. No one I know eats as fast as Soojin. It&#x2019;s one of the many ways we are opposites. I can&#x2019;t ever finish my lunch, no matter how hard I try.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Melanie! I totally feel like a Melanie, and I love that name.&#x201d; Soojin flips her long black hair off her shoulder and acts like she is meeting me for the first time. &#x201c;Hi, I&#x2019;m Melanie.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s wrong with you? Are you feeling okay?&#x201d;<br> <br>Soojin pretends to pout. &#x201c;Just tell me, who do you think I look like?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Soo-jin,&#x201d; I say slowly. I put the other half of my sandwich back into my bag and pull mini pretzels out. &#x201c;You look exactly like a Soojin.&#x201d;<br> <br>Soojin sighs again, extra loudly, just like she does when her younger sister pesters us to play with her. It seems like I&#x2019;m getting that sigh more and more lately&#x2014;ever since the start of middle school. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s because you&#x2019;ve always known me as Soojin, Amina.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, that&#x2019;s my point.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s your point?&#x201d; I hear a familiar voice behind me and turn around. A small, blond girl is carrying a cafeteria tray and a jumbo metal water bottle with the words &#x201c;I am not PLASTIC&#x201d; on it. Emily. Her green eyes and tiny nose remind me of my next-door neighbor&#x2019;s bad-tempered cat, Smokey.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; I say. I wait for her to keep walking to the other side of the lunchroom, where she always sits with Julie and her crew.<br> <br>&#x201c;What are you guys talking about?&#x201d; she asks.<br> <br>I wait for Soojin to answer, expecting her to say something to send Emily scurrying. Even though the cat gets my tongue when either Emily or Julie come prowling, Soojin never has any problem telling them exactly what she thinks.<br> <br>But Soojin just says, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m thinking of new names for myself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;New names? That&#x2019;s weird. Why?&#x201d; Emily starts a stream of questions. And as much as I want Emily to leave, I want to hear the answers.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s not weird at all, actually. My family and I are becoming citizens soon, and I&#x2019;m going to change my name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Wait. So that means you&#x2019;re not even American?&#x201d; Emily sounds offended.<br> <br>&#x201c;What?&#x201d; I ask. There is no way I heard Soojin right. &#x201c;Change your name? What for?&#x201d;<br> <br>Soojin smooths her hair, sips some fizzy juice, and takes a deep breath. &#x201c;We moved from Korea when I was four, and we aren&#x2019;t American citizens yet. But we are about to be, and I&#x2019;m going to change my name. I just haven&#x2019;t picked one yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, I have the perfect name for you,&#x201d; Emily volunteers. She plops down her tray on the table and smiles like she is about to spill a juicy secret. &#x201c;Fiona,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fiona?&#x201d; I snort. &#x201c;As in the green ogre girl from the Shrek movies?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. Fiona, as in my uncle&#x2019;s Scottish girlfriend. She&#x2019;s totally pretty.&#x201d;<br> <br>I flash Soojin a look, but she doesn&#x2019;t notice. Instead, she actually seems to be pondering the name as if it&#x2019;s a possibility. An ogre name! Suggested by Emily!<br> <br>And then Emily suddenly starts to shove herself into the space next to me. I don&#x2019;t move at first. But when she&#x2019;s nearly in my lap and Soojin still doesn&#x2019;t say anything, I scoot over to make just enough room for her. Then I lean across the table and stare hard at Soojin.<br> <br>Why is Emily sitting with us?<br> <br>Ever since before Soojin moved to Greendale from New York in third grade, Emily has worked extremely hard to be Julie&#x2019;s best friend. Mama would say Emily was Julie&#x2019;s chamchee, which means &#x201c;spoon&#x201d; in Urdu. That doesn&#x2019;t make a lot of sense, except that it also means &#x201c;suck-up.&#x201d; And Emily has always sucked up to Julie, even if that means laughing really hard at her dumb jokes or chiming in when she puts everyone else down. And by everyone else, I mean mostly Soojin and me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fi-oh-na,&#x201d; Soojin repeats. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s kind of nice.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you like it?&#x201d; Emily asks me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not&#x2014;um&#x2014;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I stammer. &#x201c;Do you seriously think she looks like a Fiona?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Duh. She can look like anybody she wants, can&#x2019;t she?&#x201d; Emily turns back to Soojin.<br> <br>My face grows hot.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you like being Soojin?&#x201d; I ask my best friend in a low voice, leaning across the table to make it harder for Emily to hear. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve been Soojin your whole life. Aren&#x2019;t you used to it?&#x201d; I want to add that we had always been the only kids in elementary school with names that everyone stumbled over. That is, until Olayinka came along in fifth grade. It&#x2019;s always been one of our &#x201c;things.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Really, Amina? I thought you, at least, would understand what it&#x2019;s like to have people mess up your name every single day.&#x201d; Soojin lets out her sigh again. And this time it feels like I deserve it, even though I don&#x2019;t know why.<br> <br>Mama told me once that she picked my name thinking it would be easiest of all the ones on her list for people in America to pronounce. But she was wrong. The neighbor with the creepy cat still calls me Amelia after living next door for five years. And my last name? Forget about it. I could barely pronounce Khokar myself until I was at least eight. And since I don&#x2019;t want to embarrass anyone by correcting them more than once, I just let them say my name any way they want.<br> <br>Soojin is the only one at school who gets it. Whenever a substitute teacher pauses during roll call and asks, &#x201c;Oh, ah, how do you say your name, dear?&#x201d; I don&#x2019;t even have to look at her to know she&#x2019;s rolling her eyes. We still collapse into giggling fits if one of us mentions the lady who called me Anemia, as in the blood disorder. But now all of a sudden Soojin wants to be a Fiona or a Heidi?<br> <br>Does it have something to do with being in middle school?<br> <br>&#x201c;What other names do you like?&#x201d; Emily asks. She&#x2019;s so interested in the conversation that she hasn&#x2019;t touched the limp grilled cheese sandwich on her tray yet. I lean back and chew my pretzels while Soojin repeats her other choices to Emily.<br> <br>&#x201c;Ooh. I like Melanie, too,&#x201d; Emily says. As I watch them chat, the lunchroom starts to feel like someone&#x2019;s cranked up the heat. My palms get sweaty, and I feel super thirsty, and not just from the pretzels. I look around and find Julie sitting at her usual table, talking with a couple of new girls from another elementary school. She doesn&#x2019;t seem to even notice that Emily is missing. I don&#x2019;t say another word until Emily gets up to put her tray away and go to the bathroom before the bell rings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Soojin&#x2019;s a pretty name too,&#x201d; I say in as normal a voice as I can. &#x201c;And I&#x2019;m not just saying it because I&#x2019;m used to it.&#x201d; I want to add that I can&#x2019;t imagine calling Soojin any of those other names, and that it would feel like I was talking to an impostor&#x2014;but I don&#x2019;t. It doesn&#x2019;t seem like Soojin wants to hear that.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; Soojin&#x2019;s face softens. &#x201c;You know, a lot of Korean people have two names, a Korean one and an English one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. But you didn&#x2019;t have another name before. So why do you want one now?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I always wished I had a different name. Besides, my whole family is picking new ones.&#x201d;<br> <br>Soojin&#x2019;s dad already goes by George and her mom is Mary, so their names would just become official after they take the oath to become citizens. I call them Mr. and Mrs. Park anyway, since my parents never let me call any grown-ups by their first names. Everyone is Auntie and Uncle or Mr. and Mrs. But Soojin taking on a new name just doesn&#x2019;t seem right.<br> <br>&#x201c;Can I still call you Soojin?&#x201d; I ask after swallowing hard to clear the lump that has formed in my throat.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want everyone to use my new name and get used to it in middle school, so it&#x2019;s normal when we get to high school. It would be messed up if my own best friend didn&#x2019;t do it.&#x201d; Soojin peers into my face expectantly. &#x201c;You will, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah. I will,&#x201d; I promise, although I cross my toes inside my shoes. I decide I will call her Soojin for as long as possible. The knots tighten in my stomach again, churning the half sandwich, seven mini pretzels, and three bites of cookie sitting inside. I watch Soojin put her empty containers back in her lunch bag, looking for a clue to why she&#x2019;s acting so bizarre. Because even though I can&#x2019;t explain why, something about Soojin wanting to drop her name makes me worry that I might be next.</p><h2>Death Star (Star Wars)</h2><p>&#x201c;THAT&#x2019;S NO MOON.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Obi-Wan Kenobi<br><br>The Death Star&#x2019;s name says it all, with bone-chilling accuracy.

It had one thing to say, and it said it loud and clear:<br><br>Scramble!<br><br>Lieutenant Commander Villian "Vil" Dance came out of a deep sleep at the blaring alarm, sat up, and leapt from his rack to the expanded metal deck of the Ready Room quarters. Save for the helmet, he already wore his space suit, one of the first things an on-call TIE pilot learned to do was sleep in full battle gear. He ran for the door, half a step ahead of the next pilot to awaken. He grabbed his headgear, darted into the hall and turned to the right, then sprinted for the launching bay.<br><br>It could be a drill; there had been plenty of those lately to keep the pilots on their toes. But maybe this time it wasn't. One could always hope.<br><br>Vil ran into the assembly area. A-grav on the flight deck was kept at slightly below one g, so that the pilots, all of whom were human or humanoid, could move a little faster and get to their stations a little sooner. The smell of launch lube was acrid in the cold air, and the pulsing lights painted the area in bright, primary flashes. Techs scrambled, getting the TIE fighters to final-set for takeoff, while pilots ran toward the craft. Vil noticed that it was just his squad being scrambled. Must not be a big problem, whatever it was.<br><br>Command always said it didn't matter which unit you got. TIE fighters were all the same, down to the last nut and bolt, but even so, every pilot had his or her favorite ship. You weren't supposed to personalize them, of course, but there were ways to tell--a scratch here, a scuff mark there . . . after a while, you got to where you knew which fighter was which. And no matter what Command said, some were better than others--a little faster, a little tighter in the turns, the laser cannons a hair quicker to fire when you touched the stud. Vil happened to know that his assigned ship this rotation was Black-11, one of his favorites. Maybe it was pure superstition, but he breathed just a little easier, knowing that particular craft had his name on it this time around.<br><br>The command officer on deck, Captain Rax Exeter, waved Vil over.<br><br>"Cap, what's up? Another drill?"<br><br>"Negative, Lieutenant. A group of prisoners somehow managed to take over one of the new Lambda-class shuttles. They're trying to get far enough away to make the jump to hyperspace. That isn't going to happen on my watch. The ID codes and tracking will be in your fighter's computer. Don't let 'em get away, son."<br><br>"No, sir. What about the crew?" Vil knew the new shuttles carried only a pilot and copilot.<br><br>"Assumed dead. These are bad guys doing this, Dance--traitors and murderers. That's reason enough to cook them, but we do not want them getting away to tell anybody what the Empire is doing out here, do we?"<br><br>"No, sir!"<br><br>"Go, Lieutenant, go!"<br><br>Vil nodded, not bothering to salute, then turned and ran. As he did, he put his helmet on and locked it into place. The hiss of air into his face was metallic and cool as the suit's system went online. It felt very comforting. The vac suit's extreme-temp-resistant weave of durasteel and plastoid, along with the polarizing densecris helmet, were the only things that would protect him from hard vacuum. Suit failure could make a strong man lose consciousness in under ten seconds, and die in under a minute. He'd seen it happen.<br><br>TIE fighters, in order to save mass, had no defensive shield generators, no hyperdrive capability, and no emergency life-support systems. They were thus fragile, but fast, and that was fine with Vil. He'd rather dodge enemy fire than hope it would bounce off. There was no skill in piloting some lumbering chunk of durasteel; might as well be sitting with your feet up at a turbolaser console back on the ship. Where was the fun in that?<br><br>The TIE tech had the hatch up on Black-11 as Vil arrived at the gantry above the ship. It was the work of an instant to clamber down and into the fighter's snug cockpit.<br><br>The hatch came down and hissed shut. Vil touched the power-up stud, and the inside of the TIE--named for the twin ion engines that drove it--lit up. He scanned the controls with a quick and experienced eye. All systems were green.<br><br>The tech raised his hand in question. Vil waved back. "Go!"<br><br>"Copy that, ST-One-One. Prepare for insertion."<br><br>Vil felt his lips twitch in annoyance. The Empire was determined to erase all signs of individuality in its pilots, on the absurd theory that nameless, faceless operators were somehow more effective. Thus the classification numbers, the anonymous flight suits and helmets, and the random rotation of spacecraft. The standardizing approach had worked reasonably well in the Clone Wars, but there was one important difference here: neither Vil nor any other TIE pilot that he knew of was a clone. None of the members of Alpha Squad had any intention of being reduced to automata. If that was what the Empire really wanted, let them use droid pilots and see how well that worked.<br><br>His musing was interrupted by the small jolt of the cycling rack below the gantry kicking on. Vil's ship began to move toward the launching bay door. He saw the tech slip his own helmet on and lock it down.<br><br>Already the bay pumps were working full blast, depressurizing the area. By the time the launch doors were open, the air would be cycled. Vil took a deep breath, readying himself for the heavy hand of g-force that would push him back into the seat when the engines hurled him forward.<br><br>Launch Control's voice crackled in his headphones. "Alpha Squad Leader, stand by for launch."<br><br>"Copy," Vil said. The launch doors pulled back with tantalizing slowness, the hydraulic thrum of their movement made audible by conduction through the floor and Black-11's frame.<br><br>"You are go for launch in five, four, three, two . . . go!"<br><br>Outside the confines of the Star Destroyer, the vastness of space enveloped Lieutenant Vil Dance as the ion engines pushed the TIE past the last stray wisps of frozen air and into the infinite dark. He grinned. He always did. He couldn't help it.<br><br>Back where I belong . . .<br><br>The flat blackness of space surrounded him. Behind him, he knew, the Steel Talon was seemingly shrinking as they pulled away from it. "Down" and to port was the curvature of the prison planet. Though they were in polar orbit, Despayre's axial tilt showed more of the night side than day. The dark hemisphere was mostly unrelieved blackness, with a few lonely lights here and there.<br><br>Vil flicked his comm--though it came on automatically at launch, a good pilot always toggled it, just to be sure. "Alpha Squad, pyramid formation on me as soon as you are clear," he said. "Go to tactical channel five, that's tac-fiver, and log in."<br><br>Vil switched his own comm channel to five. It was a lower-powered band with a shorter range, but that was the point--you didn't want the enemy overhearing you. And in some cases, it wasn't a good idea for the comm officer monitoring you back on the base ship to be privy to conversations, either. They tended to be a bit more informal than the Empire liked.<br><br>There came a chorus of "Copy, Alpha Leader!" from the other eleven pilots in his squad as they switched over to the new channel.<br><br>It took only a few seconds for the last fighter to launch, and only a few more for the squad to form behind Vil.<br><br>"What's the drill, Vil?" That from Benjo, aka ST-1-2, his second in command and right panelman.<br><br>"Alpha Squadron, we have a Lambda-class shuttle captured by prisoners. They are running for hyper. Either they give up and come back, or we dust 'em."<br><br>"Lambda-class? That's one of the new ones, right? They have any guns?"<br><br>Vil sighed. That was Raar Anyell, a Corellian like Vil himself, but not somebody you'd want to hold up as a prime example of the human species. "Don't you bother to read the boards at all, Anyell?"<br><br>"I was just about to do that, sir, when the alarm went off. Was looking right at 'em. Had the latest notices right in my hand. Sir."<br><br>The other pilots laughed, and even Vil had to grin. Anyell was a foul-up everywhere except in the cockpit, but he was a good enough pilot that Vil was willing to give him some slice.<br><br>His sensor screen pinged, giving him an image of their quarry. He altered course to intercept.<br><br>"Anybody else behind on his homework, listen up," he said. "The Lambda-class shuttle is twenty meters long, has a top speed of fourteen hundred g, a Class-One hyperdrive, and can carry twenty troops in full battle gear--probably a couple more convicts in civvies.<br><br>"The ship carries three double-blaster cannons and two double-laser cannons. It can't accelerate worth a wheep and it turns slower than a comet, but if you get in its sights, it can blow you to itty-bitty pieces. It would be embarrassing to have to inform your family you got shot apart by a shuttle, so stay alert."<br><br>There came another chorus of acknowledgments:<br><br>"Copy, sir."<br><br>"Yes, sir!"<br><br>"No sweat."<br><br>"Anyell, I didn't hear your response."<br><br>"Oh, sorry, sir, I was taking a little nap. What was the question?"<br><br>Before the squad commander could reply, the shuttle suddenly loomed ahead. It was running as silently as possible, with no lights, but as its orbit brought it across the terminator and out of Despayre's night side, the sunlight struck rays from its hull.<br><br>"There is our target, four kilometers dead ahead. I want a fast flyby so they can see us, and then I want a fountain pattern dispersal and loop, two klicks minimum distance and bracket, one, four, four, and two, you know who you are. I'll move in close and have a word with whoever they have flying the stolen spacecraft."<br><br>Benjo: "Aw, Lieutenant, come on, let us have a shot, too."<br><br>"Negative. If you had a clue about the vessel, I might, but since you're just as likely to shoot each other as the quarry, you'll hold the bracket."<br><br>More acknowledgments, but without much enthusiasm. He couldn't blame his squad--they hadn't had any action except drills since they'd been assigned to this project--but his secondary goal was to bring all his men back alive. The primary, of course, was to accomplish their mission. He didn't need a squad for this; any fighter pilot worth his spit should be able to deal with a lumbering shuttle, even one with the new-vehicle smell still in it. The Lambda's delta vee wasn't all that efficient, but with constant drive it could get above the solar plane and far enough out of the planet's gravity well to engage its hyperdrive fairly soon--and once it was in the chute, they'd never find it.<br><br>But that wasn't going to happen.<br><br>The pyramid-shaped formation zipped past the fleeing shuttle, close enough for Vil to see the pilot sitting in the command seat. He didn't look surprised, of course--he would have seen them coming on the sensors. But he couldn't outrun them, couldn't dodge, and no way could he take out a full squad of TIE fighters even if he was the best gunner who'd ever lived, not in that boat. And anyway, Vil wasn't going to give him the opportunity to try.<br><br>The squad flowered into the dispersal maneuver as ordered, looping out and away to their assigned positions, angled pressor beams in their arrays providing maneuverability. Vil pulled a high-g tight turn and came around to parallel the shuttle a few hundred meters away, slightly above it. He watched the wing turrets closely. As soon as they started to track him, he jinked to port, then to starboard, slowed, then sped up. They tried to keep up with him, but they were a hair too slow.<br><br>Vil toggled to a wide-band channel. They'd hear this back in the Destroyer, he knew.<br><br>"Attention, shuttle RLH-One. Turn the craft around and proceed immediately to Star Destroyer Steel Talon's tractor beam range."<br><br>There was no answer; nothing but the slight hiss of the carrier.<br><br>"Shuttle craft, do you copy my transmission?"<br><br>Another pause. Then: "Yeah, we hear you, rocketjock. We aren't of a mind to do that."<br><br>Vil looked at his control panel. They were two minutes away from Minimum Safe Distance--the point far enough from Despayre where they could safely attempt the jump to lightspeed. Jump too close to a planet's gravity well and the shift would tear the vessel apart. If the guy he was talking to had enough skill to fly the shuttle, he'd know that. His control panel would tell him when he reached MSD, and then it would be over. Lieutenant Dance would have failed a mission, for the first time.<br><br>Never happen, he thought. "Turn it around, or we will fire," he said.<br><br>"You'd do that? Just blow us apart? Essentially murder fifteen men--and two women? One of them is old enough to be your granny. You can live with that?"<br><br>He was stalling for time, Vil knew. The beings on that shuttle were bad enough to have been sent to the galaxy's number one prison planet, and the Imperial courts didn't bother to do that with petty thieves or traffic violators. His granny hadn't robbed any banks or killed anybody. Not that he knew of, anyway.<br><br>"Shuttle pilot, I say again--"<br><br>Vil saw the port turret on the shuttle open up. He cut across the craft's flight path, angling away aft as the starboard gun began firing. He hit his thrusters full, coming up in a half loop and twist away from the incoming laserfire.<br><br>Even a good gunner couldn't have spiked him at this angle, and these guys weren't anywhere close to good enough. Still, the pulsed incandescent beams came close.<br><br>"Lieutenant--!" That from Benjo.<br><br>"Hold your position, Alpha Squad, there's no problem here." Cool and calm. Like discussing what they might be having for dinner.<br><br>He zipped Black-11 out of range.<br><br>The clock was running down. Less than a minute to MSD.<br><br>"Last chance, shuttle. Turn it around. Now."<br><br>In answer, the pilot pulled the shuttle topward so his gunners could get a better angle. They started shooting again.<br><br>The shots were wild, but there was always a chance a stray beam could hit you, even by accident.</p><h2>Connecting: Healing Ourselves and Our Relationships</h2><p><p>In his most significant book to date, Dr. Larry Crabb expands on his lifelong work in the field of psychotherapy to adopt a groundbreaking, but biblical, approach to healing the deep wounds of the soul-an approach that centers around building intimate, healing mini-communities in our lives and churches.</p><p>Dr. Crabb envisions a day when communities of God's people-ordinary Christians whose lives connect as husband to wife, brother to sister, friend to friend-will accomplish most of the healing that we now depend on mental health professionals to provide.</p><p>God has deposited within us the power to heal soul-disease and that power is released to do its work as we relate to each other in revolutionary new ways.

Richard Hammerschlag, Co-president, Society for Acupuncture Research. --Richard Hammerschlag, Co-president, Society for Acupuncture Research.<br><br>Applause for the Bicameral View: Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology, by Chen and Chen The new materia medica entitled Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology by John Chen and Tina Chen, is a valuable contribution, not just because more than 1200 glossy pages describe over 500 herbs and their many parts and preparations, but also because the language of pharmacology and herbology is precisely chosen. The volume is steeped in the foundations of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and then infused with Western science. Clear explanations and tables make the details of this book accessible. Traditional properties, channels, and therapeutic actions of each herb are described. Key diagnostic symptoms are differentiated in several tables using traditional terms. Other charts that compare similarities and differences of herbs within the category are invaluable tools for the student. Additional lists of herbs from other categories that share the section s function are found in each summary. For example, page 357 contains a list of 31 herbs that have Damp-Draining functions but ordinarily belong to other categories. Pharmacology, Clinical Research and Toxicology are thoroughly referenced, using sources selected, according to the authors, by relevance, strong study design, English language, use of human subjects, and wherever possible, with preference given to randomized, blinded, controlled studies over observational reports. However, most of the research available on Chinese herbs is still in Chinese language journals. Herbal Cautions, Contraindications, and Herb-Drug interactions are examined in many of the monographs. The Author s Comments sections with clinical notes are useful to practitioners as is the specific information for treatment of Overdosage. For example, page 788 describes symptoms of Quan xie overdose and contains 5 formulas for treatment. There are more good lists and charts, for cautions during nursing and pregnancy, dietary interactions, and dosing by age and weight. Writing and referencing this materia medica required eight years to complete, with a staff of 50, peer review by 35 experts in the field, and photos contributed from three herb companies. To improve its suitability as a desk reference the photos should be reviewed for standard species. For example, on page G5, the photo titled Ban Lan Gen is a substitute commonly found in many dispensaries. The Chen s have accomplished an impressive work that brings Traditional Medicine together with Pharmacology. The words chosen to talk about herbs inevitably will define the boundaries of our discussions on Traditional Medicine. An author from the last century emphasized the importance and implications of speech this way: People evolve a language in order to describe and thus control their circumstances, in order not to be submerged by a reality that they cannot articulate. * As herbs are increasingly examined, researched, and regulated, herb practitioners must cling to the foundational elements that give reason and utility to Traditional Medicine. The art and science of chemistry has its own useful language, rules, scope, and beauty. Chinese Medical Theory has a different language and world view. For the advancement of the herbal profession, Chinese Medical Herbology and Pharmacology makes good use of both.

It takes a craftsman&#39;s touch to shape the surfaces of the head for the optimal flow characteristics and the best performance. Porting demands the right tools, skills, and application of knowledge. Few other engine builders have the same level of knowledge and skill porting engine heads as David Vizard. All the aspects of porting stock as well as aftermarket heads in aluminum and cast-iron constructions are covered. Vizard goes into great depth and detail on porting aftermarket heads. Starting with the basic techniques up to more advanced techniques, you are shown how to port iron and aluminum heads as well as benefits of hand and CNC porting. You are also shown how to build a high-quality flow bench at home so you can test your work and obtain professional results. Vizard shows how to optimize flow paths through the heads, past the valves, and into the combustion chamber. The book covers blending the bowls, a basic porting procedure, and also covers pocket porting, porting the intake runners, and many advanced procedures. These advanced procedures include unshrouding valves, porting a shortside turn from the floor of the port down toward the valve seat, and developing the ideal port area and angle. All of these changes combine to produce optimal flow velocity through the engine for maximum power.</p><p>In certain terms, the more air your cylinder head flows, the more horsepower your engine can make. Porting cylinder heads allows you to flow more air and unlock hidden performance potential. As a result, you can extract significant horsepower and torque gains. To port heads, it takes a craftsman&#x2019;s touch to shape the passages of the head for the most efficient airflow and effective combustion of the fuel charge. To verify this work, you need to flow test the heads on a flow bench. In this ground-breaking book, porting master and engine building wizard David Vizard covers all the nuances of porting heads and how to build an affordable flow bench to test the results. Porting cylinder heads is an art and a science. It&#x2019;s like sculpting a piece of clay into a glorious final form and, therefore, it demands the right tools, skills, and application of knowledge. With 50 years of experience and uncommon acumen, David Vizard explains the principles, philosophy, and techniques for extracting maximum performance from cylinder heads. All the aspects of porting stock and aftermarket heads in aluminum and cast iron are covered. Vizard explains how to optimize flow paths through the heads, past the valves, and into the combustion chamber. He covers blending the bowls, pocket porting, unshrouding the valves, porting the intake runners, and many other advanced procedures. All of these changes combine to produce optimal flow velocity through the engine for the maximum power. If you&#x2019;ve always wanted to port your heads but didn&#x2019;t have information to confidently obtain the best results, now you do.David Vizard is a revered engine builder and acknowledged Chevy big-block engine expert, which is why GM contracted him to develop several engine packages for the Chevy big-block crate program.

My Son . . .: A Guide to Healing After Death, Loss, or Suicide</h2><p>At bottom, life and death are our greatest teachers--if we shall but listen. Iris Bolton&#39;s personal story of her son&#39;s suicide is a deeply moving, poignant one. It is a story of both a devastating tragedy and an exquisite triumph--and the agonizing, relentless, conflicted process connecting these two oppositional pulls. We in our Western, ultra-scientific and technological society are just beginning to discover that death, from the beginnings of time, has always been present. Life and death are inextricably bound together in the process of living. All of us have known this all the time, but we have pretended that we didn&#39;t know what we knew. Until recently, we have chosen to keep death in the shadows and separated from the light of life. As a result, we have made ourselves more vulnerable to its pain and destruction. That this is true is well documented in this book. I celebrate our growing consciousness that death is a Presence always present in all our lives. And living life in this manner of awareness gives us a new sense of personal power and freedom. We are better enabled to live, explore, experience, and know God&#39;s universe and Love as He intended--and thereby be more adequately prepared for the final journey . . . Home. Iris Bolton&#39;s book is a powerful step in that direction.</p><p></p><h2>Everything She Ever Wanted: A True Story of Obsessive Love, Murder, and Betrayal</h2><p>WAS SHE A SWEET SOUTHERN CHARMER? <br> OR A COLD-BLOODED KILLER? <br> For their wedding portrait, petite Pat Taylor and handsome Tom Allanson posed as Rhett and Scarlett. Both came from fine Southern families, and dreamed of the Tara-like plantation where they would grow roses, raise horses, and move in the genteel circles of Atlanta society. Less than two months later, their dream exploded in terror and murder: their beautiful home mysteriously burned to the ground and Tom was convicted of the brutal slaying of his mother and father. <br> Pat's only brother had died in a puzzling suicide, her grandparents-in-law were poisoned with arsenic, and no one -- from her wealthy employers to her own children -- was safe when Pat Allanson didn't get her way. It took Georgia lawmen more than two decades to stop her for good -- if indeed they have. <br> In this fascinating account, Ann Rule delivers a tour de force: a whirlwind of misguided love, denial, guilt, and passions out of control; a series of brilliantly manipulated crimes; the bizarre and horrifying tale of two families brought to ruin; and, at the center of it all, the heartless, supremely selfish sociopath whose evil hid behind soft words and gentle manners, but who destroyed -- without mercy -- those who loved her.</p><p>Ann Rule wrote thirty-five&nbsp;<i>New York Times</i>&nbsp;bestsellers, all of them still in print.

"Cockroach." "Lice." "Vermin." People often regard members of their own kind as less than human, and use terms like these for those whom they wish to harm, enslave, or exterminate. Dehumanization has made atrocities like the Holocaust, the genocide in Rwanda, and the slave trade possible. But it isn't just a relic of the past. We still find it in war, genocide, xenophobia, and racism. Smith shows that it is a dangerous mistake to think of dehumanization as the exclusive preserve of Nazis, communists, terrorists, Jews, Palestinians, or any other monster of the moment. We are all potential dehumanizers, just as we are all potential objects of dehumanization. The problem of dehumanization is <i>everyone's</i> problem. </p><p><i>Less Than Human</i> is the first book to illuminate precisely how and why we sometimes think of others as subhuman creatures. It draws on a rich mix of history, evolutionary psychology, biology, anthropology, and philosophy to document the pervasiveness of dehumanization, describe its forms, and explain why we so often resort to it. <i>Less Than Human</i> is a powerful and highly original study of the roots of human violence and bigotry, and it as timely as it is relevant.</p></p><p><p>Dr. David Livingstone Smith is a professor of philosophy and founding director of The Human Nature Project at the University of New England.

There is no animal worse than them.<br>&#x2014;RABBI OVADIA YOSEF, <em>HAARETZ </em>1<br>&#x201c;COME ON DOGS. Where are all the dogs of Khan Younis? Son of a bitch! Son of a whore! Your mother&#x2019;s cunt!&#x201d; Degrading taunts in Arabic rang out from behind the fence that divided the Palestinian side of the Khan Younis refugee camp from the Israeli side. Located near the southern tip of the Gaza Strip, just outside the ancient town of Khan Younis, the camp was established to house 35,000 of the nearly one million Arabs who had been displaced by the 1948 Arab-Israeli war. By the beginning of the twenty-first century its population had swelled to over 60,000 souls housed in thirteen squalid cement blocks.<br>The torrent of invective did not come from the mouth of an angry Muslim; it was broadcast from a loudspeaker mounted on an armored Israeli Jeep. <em>New York Times</em>journalist Chris Hedges was in the camp that day, and watched as Palestinian boys began to lob stones at the Jeep in a futile gesture of defiance. Hedges recounts:<br>There was the boom of a percussion grenade. The boys, most no more than ten or eleven years old, scattered, running clumsily through the heavy sand. They descended out of sight behind the dune in front of me. There were no sounds of gunfire. The soldiers shot with silencers. The bullets from M-16 rifles, unseen by me, tumbled end-over-end through their slight bodies. I would see the destruction, the way their stomachs were ripped out, the gaping holes in their limbs and torsos, later in the hospital.2<br>Four children were shot. Only three survived. One of them, a boy named Ahmed, explained to Hedges what had happened. &#x201c;Over the loudspeakers the soldiers told us to come to the fence to get chocolate and money,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Then they cursed us. Then they fired a grenade. We started to run. They shot Ali in the back.&#x201d;3<br>Khan Younis had long been a stronghold of Hamas, the Islamic Resistance Movement, and when the Israeli troops pulled out of the Gaza Strip in the fall of 2005, the bright green banners of Hamas fluttered from the asbestos rooftops of the camp. Hamas was founded in 1987 to end the Israeli presence in the region and to establish an Islamic state with Jerusalem as its capital. Although Hamas is devoted mainly to supporting schools, hospitals, and cultural activities, it is best known for its violence&#x2014;its abductions, assassinations, suicide bombings, and rocket attacks against Israeli civilians. Osama Alfarra, the mayor of Khan Younis and a member of Hamas, was one of the many Palestinians who rejoiced when Israel relinquished control of the Gaza strip. &#x201c;Gaza was a beginning,&#x201d; he told a reporter from the British <em>Guardian</em>newspaper. &#x201c;You know how you hunt foxes? You dig them out of their holes. The fox is gone from Gaza to the West Bank. The resistance will dig him out of his hole there.&#x201d;4<br>Osama Alfarra and the anonymous soldiers in the Jeep stood on opposite sides of a single conflict. And yet, their attitudes were uncannily alike. Each portrayed the other as a nonhuman animal. The soldier represented Ali and his companions as dogs, unclean animals in both Jewish and Islamic lore. Likewise, Osama Alfarra&#x2019;s depiction of Israel as a fox represents a whole nation as vermin, fit to be hunted down and destroyed. The sly fox, an amalgam of greed and guile, has much in common with the traditional derogatory stereotype of the Jew, as exemplified by thirteenth-century Muslim writer Al-Jaubari&#x2019;s characterization of the Jewish people in <em>The Chosen One&#x2019;s Unmasking of Divine Mysteries</em>:<br>Know that these people are the most cunning creatures, the vilest, most unbelieving and hypocritical. While ostensibly the most humble and miserable, they are in fact the most vicious of men. This is the very essence of rascality and accursedness.... Look at this cunning and craft and vileness; how they take other people&#x2019;s moneys, ruin their lives....<br>And more recently, the remarks of Imam Yousif al-Zahar, a member of Hamas, conveyed the same idea. &#x201c;Jews are a people who cannot be trusted,&#x201d; he remarked. &#x201c;They have been traitors to all agreements&#x2014;go back to history. Their fate is their vanishing.&#x201d;5<br>The soldier in the Israeli military Jeep dehumanized his Palestinian targets, and Osama Alfarra and his comrades dehumanized their Israeli enemies. In both examples&#x2014;and in many, many more that I will describe in this book&#x2014;a whole group of people is represented as less than human, as a prelude and accompaniment to extreme violence. It&#x2019;s tempting to see reference to the subaltern other as mere talk, as nothing more than degrading metaphor. I will argue that this view is sorely misguided. Dehumanization isn&#x2019;t a way of talking. It&#x2019;s a way of thinking&#x2014;a way of thinking that, sadly, comes all too easily to us. Dehumanization is a scourge, and has been so for millennia. It acts as a psychological lubricant, dissolving our inhibitions and inflaming our destructive passions. As such, it empowers us to perform acts that would, under other circumstances, be unthinkable. In the pages and chapters to follow, I will do my best to explain what this form of thinking consists in, how it works, and why we so readily slip into it.<br>Before I get to work explaining how dehumanization works, I want to make a preliminary case for its importance. So, to get the ball rolling, I&#x2019;ll briefly discuss the role that dehumanization played in what is rightfully considered the single most destructive event in human history: the Second World War. More than 70 million people died in the war, most of them civilians. Millions died in combat. Many were burned alive by incendiary bombs and, in the end, nuclear weapons. Millions more were victims of systematic genocide. Dehumanization made much of this carnage possible.<br>Let&#x2019;s begin at the end. The 1946 Nuremberg doctors&#x2019; trial was the first of twelve military tribunals held in Germany after the defeat of Germany and Japan. Twenty doctors and three administrators&#x2014;twenty-two men and a single woman&#x2014;stood accused of war crimes and crimes against humanity. They had participated in Hitler&#x2019;s euthanasia program, in which around 200,000 mentally and physically handicapped people deemed unfit to live were gassed to death, and they performed fiendish medical experiments on thousands of Jewish, Russian, Roma, and Polish prisoners.<br>Principal prosecutor Telford Taylor began his opening statement with these somber words:<br>The defendants in this case are charged with murders, tortures, and other atrocities committed in the name of medical science. The victims of these crimes are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A handful only are still alive; a few of the survivors will appear in this courtroom. But most of these miserable victims were slaughtered outright or died in the course of the tortures to which they were subjected.... To their murderers, these wretched people were not individuals at all. They came in wholesale lots and were treated worse than animals.6<br>He went on to describe the experiments in detail. Some of these human guinea pigs were deprived of oxygen to simulate high-altitude parachute jumps. Others were frozen, infested with malaria, or exposed to mustard gas. Doctors made incisions in their flesh to simulate wounds, inserted pieces of broken glass or wood shavings into them, and then, tying off the blood vessels, introduced bacteria to induce gangrene. Taylor described how men and women were made to drink seawater, were infected with typhus and other deadly diseases, were poisoned and burned with phosphorus, and how medical personnel conscientiously recorded their agonized screams and violent convulsions.<br>The descriptions in Taylor&#x2019;s narrative are so horrifying that it&#x2019;s easy to overlook what might seem like an insignificant rhetorical flourish: his comment that &#x201c;these wretched people were ... treated <em>worse than animals</em>.&#x201d; But this comment raises a question of deep and fundamental importance. What is it that enables one group of human beings to treat another group as though they were subhuman creatures?<br>A rough answer isn&#x2019;t hard to come by. Thinking sets the agenda for action, and thinking of humans as less than human paves the way for atrocity. The Nazis were explicit about the status of their victims. They were <em>Untermenschen</em>&#x2014;subhumans&#x2014;and as such were excluded from the system of moral rights and obligations that bind humankind together. It&#x2019;s wrong to kill a person, but permissible to exterminate a rat. To the Nazis, all the Jews, Gypsies, and the others were rats: dangerous, disease-carrying rats.<br>Jews were the main victims of this genocidal project. From the beginning, Adolf Hitler and his followers were convinced that the Jewish people posed a deadly threat to all that was noble in humanity. In the apocalyptic Nazi vision, these putative enemies of civilization were represented as parasitic organisms&#x2014;as leeches, lice, bacteria, or vectors of contagion. &#x201c;Today,&#x201d; Hitler proclaimed in 1943, &#x201c;international Jewry is the ferment of decomposition of peoples and states, just as it was in antiquity. It will remain that way as long as peoples do not find the strength to get rid of the virus.&#x201d; Both the death camps (the gas chambers of which were modeled on delousing chambers) and the <em>Einsatzgruppen</em>(paramilitary death squads that roamed across Eastern Europe following in the wake of the advancing German army) were responses to what the Nazis perceived to be a lethal pestilence.7<br>Sometimes the Nazis thought of their enemies as vicious, bloodthirsty predators rather than parasites.

Although his generals were doubtful of success, younger officers and NCOs were desperate to believe that their homes and families could be saved from the vengeful Red Army approaching from the east. Many were exultant at the prospect of striking back.<br><br>The allies, taken by surprise, found themselves fighting two panzer armies. Belgian civilians abandoned their homes, justifiably afraid of German revenge. Panic spread even to Paris. While some American soldiers, overwhelmed by the German onslaught, fled or surrendered, others held on heroically, creating breakwaters which slowed the German advance.<br>&nbsp;<br>The harsh winter conditions and the savagery of the battle became comparable to the Eastern Front. In fact the Ardennes became the Western Front&#x2019;s counterpart to Stalingrad. There was terrible ferocity on both sides, driven by desperation and revenge, in which the normal rules of combat were breached. The Ardennes&#x2014;involving more than a million men&#x2014;would prove to be the battle which finally broke the back of the Wehrmacht.<br>&nbsp;<br>In this deeply researched work, with striking insights into the major players on both sides, Antony Beevor gives us the definitive account of the Ardennes offensive which was to become the greatest battle of World War II.</p><p><b>Antony Beevor</b> is the bestselling author of <i>D-Day: The Battle for Normandy, </i>which received the Royal United Services&#x2019; Institute Westminster Medal<i>; The Battle for Spain</i>, which received the La Vanguardia Prize; <i>Paris After the Liberation 1944&#x2013;1949; Stalingrad</i>, winner of the Samuel Johnson Prize, the Wolfson Prize for History, and the Hawthornden Prize for Literature; and <i>The Fall of Berlin 1945</i>, which received the first Longman-History Today Trustees&#x2019; Award.

The author tracks troop movements and positioning throughout the long conflict, while accounting for decisions made on the field, in the war room, and all the way up the chain of command to Gen.

No one tells it better than Antony Beevor. He combines wide-ranging archival research, publishedsources, personal accounts, and firsthand knowledge of the terrain. He moves easily among discussions of policy and strategy, the personalities and interactions of commanders, and the viewpoints and standpoints of the people at the sharp end&#x2014;not only those in the tanks and the foxholes but the civilians caught in the mesh of modern war.

Beevor has delivered another perfectly judged episode of the second world war, a worthy companion to the works that made his name. Yet again, he has shown that he has the gift of alchemy.&#x201d;&#x2014;Roger Moorhouse, <b><i>The</i> </b><i><b>Financial Times</b><br><br></i>"What builds up is an exemplary picture of the misery and horror of this most appalling conflict, in which more than a million men fought in conditions comparable to those on the Eastern Front."&#x2014;Clare Mulley,&nbsp;<b><i>The</i>&nbsp;<i>Australian</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> &#x201c;No one has recounted it better than Beevor.

There&#x2019;s rarely a judgmental note to his writing. It&#x2019;s like having Virgil there to lead you through the underworld: he doesn&#x2019;t leave you stranded amid the horror, but leads you back out again, a wiser person for having undergone the journey.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Keith Lowe in <i>The Daily Telegraph</i></b><br><br> &#x201c;The Master of War . . . The Ardennes is the latest of Beevor&#x2019;s books on the campaigns of the Second World War.

It is written with all of Beevor&#x2019;s customary verve and elegance. His remarkable and trademark ability is to encompass the wide sweep of campaigns yet never forget the piquant details of what happened to the individual. . .

Allied crimes have sometimes been underplayed or presented solely in terms of hot-blooded revenge. Beevor is braver, rightly exposing the open approval of a number of Allied generals for a policy of retaliatory execution of German prisoners. This is history as it should be written. . . Hitler&#x2019;s greatest mistake, Beevor argues, was that he &#x2018;misjudged the soldiers of an army [he] had affected to despise&#x2019;. This is above all the story of those soldiers, and for that alone it deserves the widest audience.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Clare Mulley in</b><i><b> <i>The</i> <i>Spectator</i></b></i></p><h2>The Death of Artemio Cruz: A Novel (FSG Classics)</h2><p><p>As the novel opens, Artemio Cruz, the all-powerful newspaper magnate and land baron, lies confined to his bed and, in dreamlike flashes, recalls the pivotal episodes of his life.

Across a wide range of sectors, these firms are transforming themselves into platforms: businesses that provide the hardware and software foundation for others to operate on. This transformation signals a major shift in how capitalist firms operate and how they interact with the rest of the economy: the emergence of platform capitalism.</p> <p>This book critically examines these new business forms, tracing their genesis from the long downturn of the 1970s to the boom and bust of the 1990s and the aftershocks of the 2008 crisis. It shows how the fundamental foundations of the economy are rapidly being carved up among a small number of monopolistic platforms, and how the platform introduces new tendencies within capitalism that pose significant challenges to any vision of a post-capitalist future. This book will be essential reading for anyone who wants to understand how the most powerful tech companies of our time are transforming the global economy."</p></p><p><p>Nick Srnicek (born 1982) is an American writer and academic.

Inheriting Ivy Compton-Burnett&#x2019;s uncanny sensitivity to the terrifying undercurrents that swirl beneath the apparent calm of respectable family life while showing a deep sympathy of her own for human loneliness, Taylor depicted dislocation with the unflinching presence of mind of Graham Greene. But for Taylor, unlike Greene, dislocation began not in distant climes but right at home. It is in the living room, playroom, and bedroom that Taylor stages her unforgettable dramas of alienation and impossible desire.<br><br> Taylor&#x2019;s stories, many of which originally appeared in <i>The New Yorker,</i> are her central achievement. Here are self-improving spinsters and gossiping girls, war orphans and wallflowers, honeymooners and barmaids, mistresses and murderers. Margaret Drabble&#x2019;s new selection reveals a writer whose wide sympathies and restless curiosity are matched by a steely penetration into the human heart and mind.</p><p><b>Elizabeth Taylor </b>(1912&#x2013;1975) was born into a middle-class family in Berkshire, England. She held a variety of positions, including librarian and governess, before marrying a businessman in 1936. Nine years later, her first novel, <i>At Mrs. Lippincote&#x2019;s</i>, appeared. She would go on to publish eleven more novels, including <i>Angel</i> and <i>A Game of Hide and Seek</i> (both available as NYRB Classics), four collections of short stories (many of which originally appeared in <i>The New Yorker</i>, <i>Harper</i>&#x2019;s, and other magazines), and a children&#x2019;s book, <i>Mossy Trotter</i>, while living with her husband and two children in Buckingham�shire. Long championed&nbsp; by Ivy Compton-Burnett, Barbara Pym, Robert Liddell, Kingsley Amis, and Elizabeth Jane Howard, Taylor&#x2019;s novels and stories have been the basis for a number of films, including <i>Mrs. Palfrey at the Claremont</i> (2005), starring Joan Plowright, and Fran�ois Ozon&#x2019;s <i>Angel</i> (2007).<br><br><b>Margaret Drabble</b> is the author of eighteen novels, including <i>The Needle&#x2019;s Eye</i>, <i>The Peppered Moth</i>, <i>The Seven Sisters</i>, <i>The Sea Lady</i>, and most recently, <i>The Pure Gold Baby</i>. Among her works of nonfiction are biographies of Arnold Bennett and Angus Wilson. She has edited the fifth and sixth editions of the <i>Oxford Companion to World Literature</i> and was made a Dame of the British Empire in 2008.&#x201c;For years, Taylor&#x2019;s short stories&#x2014;painfully smart,&nbsp; hilarious, dark&#x2014;have been entirely out of print in the United States.&#x201d;&nbsp;&#x2014;Britt Peterson, <i>The New Republic</i><br><br>&#x201c;I find the writing of Elizabeth Taylor fresh, and inevitably hitting the right nail on the head in every sentence.

The book's authors clear away centuries of confusion surrounding subjects that are seldom addressed in modern sermons and Bible studies. Using the ancient Hebrew language and culture, the authors clarify many of the Bible's so-called "mysteries" and help the reader rediscover many of the foundational truths that have been "lost in translation." Topics include: � Who is the Bride of Messiah? � Is there a difference between covenant and testament? � Israel: Who are they really? � What is the difference between devils, demons, and nephilim? Join us on an exciting adventure to rediscover the treasures still buried within the pages of The Book that reveal the pathway to the heart of God. "A must-read for the church! Providing foundational insights which lead to a greater understanding of God's master plan, this book will open your eyes to scriptural distortions due to the centuries of Greek influence on the church." - Corey Berti, Senior Pastor, Silver Valley Worship Center, ID "I've been a believer for 12 years, and I've read numerous scriptures that didn't make sense. The authors do a tremendous job of explaining the importance of understanding our Hebrew roots which provide context and clarity to the overall theme of God's message. It's like watching TV in black and white and then suddenly seeing it in color. The truth hasn't changed, but it's meaning becomes more vivid." - Jason Carr</p></p><p></p><h2>The Triumph of Zion-our Personal Quest for the New Jerusalem</h2><p>Popular author and speaker John Pontius has once again written a classic! As the world anticipates its end, we Latter-day Saints are preparing to build the city of Zion. With so much emphasis on building Zion physically on Earth, we sometimes forget that the best place to build Zion is within our own hearts. John Pontius carefully details the importance of Zion in our own lives, opening our eyes to our oft-overlooked obligations and vast privileges. With hundreds of references from the scriptures and the prophets of our dispensation, The Triumph of Zion Our Personal Quest for the New Jerusalem will guide you in obtaining the blessings of Zion for yourself and your family.</p><p>I picked up this book after starting to read the unblog that Brother John keeps. I found his words on his blog resonating with my own spiritual path and found great power in the words. This book is his blog on steroids. I have felt compelled to seek this path of inner Zion with great fervor, and this book has guided me in my study of the scriptures. There is nothing new, or innovative within the text. In fact it is a call to remember what has been in front of us since the restoration of the Gospel. If you're even reading this comment, then I believe you have felt this stirring yourself. Whether of not you choose to use this book as a help in your journey, listen to the call. We are Zion, we just don't know it yet. --Amazon<br><br>This book has information that is not for the weak in faith! It is not an easy reader, and it requires your full attention! It is full of Gospel-centered information that you will never hear at church! I am deeply grateful to Mr Pontius for his contribution (in all his books) to my understanding of the things that were well-known in the early days of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, but have not been continually taught in our day. If you are searching for something more than what you are hearing in church, than this book as well as others by Mr Pontius will give you the answers you are seeking. All of the claims Mr Pontius makes in his books are backed by reliable sources, and if you want more than what you are currently receiving in your Gospel studies, than his books are for you! --Amazon<br><br>I normally don't do book reviews, but this book is too good to pass on a review. John Pontius recently passed away due to cancer. He is greatly missed!! In his book he lays out the details of how a person can turn their heart and will over to God to make of them what He will. We can build Zion in our hearts here and now and will be prepared for the second advent of the Lord when he comes. How exciting!! This is a very good book and a very interesting read. --Amazon</p><h2>Knowledge Is Beautiful: Impossible Ideas, Invisible Patterns, Hidden Connections--Visualized</h2><p><p>In this sequel to the bestselling book <em>The Visual Miscellaneum</em>, author David McCandless uses stunning and unique visuals to reveal unexpected insights into how the world really works.</p><p>Every day, every hour, every minute we are bombarded with information, from television, from newspapers, from the Internet, we&#x2019;re steeped in it.

Now Craig&#x2019;s friend and fellow climber Topher Donahue brings the content up to current standards and includes technological advances, while preserving Craig&#x2019;s comprehensive approach. An award-winning climber in his own right, Topher uses his writing and photography skills to simplify the complex world of modern climbing technique and reveals the thought process behind safe and practical climbing methods.<br>This second edition includes European climbing techniques that offer alternatives to those traditionally taught in North America. Topher has also incorporated new lessons derived from accidents due, in part, to the increased popularity of climbing. Also found in this edition:<br>� Over 10,000 more words and 125 more photos<br><br>� Three never-before-published techniques: Adjustable Hitch, High Friction Tubes, and Bight Method<br><br>� Detailed technical updates throughout<br><br>� New distinction between &#x201c;anchor&#x201d; (a group of placements, pieces, or bolts used at the end of a pitch or for top rope or rappel setup) and &#x201c;placement&#x201d; or &#x201c;piece&#x201d; (individual cams, nuts, etc., used in groups to make an anchor or used individually as protection on a pitch)<br></p><p>We were sitting at the base of the Nautilus, a rock formation known for prickly off-width cracks in Wyoming's Vedauwoo, when Sylvia Luebben asked me if I would consider writing a new edition of her late husband Craig Luebben's Rock Climbing: Mastering Basic Skills. <br><br>A kaleidoscope of thoughts went through my mind as I considered her offer. I was honored that she would ask me. I was sad to think that Craig wasn't alive to do it himself. I was intimidated by the undertaking of trying to update an award-winning book. <br><br>As I sat there below the Nautilus, one of Craig's favorite rocks, his daughter Giulia was climbing a tricky 5.9, and my kids were playing around on the rock slabs at the base. Climbing is very much alive in our families, and while I've mostly stepped away from the big alpine due to the time away from the family, I go rock climbing a few times each week. Some people go to the gym, ride a bike, or do yoga. I climb.<br><br>I pondered the accident that killed Craig, an ice wall collapse in the North Cascades; the kind of accident that could happen while walking under an icy roof or driving a car across an avalanche zone. There is one big difference: our culture accepts the risk of walking under icy roofs and driving on wintery roads. <br><br>A couple of weeks later I told Sylvia I'd be honored to take on the new edition. My inspiration was partly his family's steadfast belief in the beauty of climbing, partly his and my friendship that took us up the first one-day winter ascent of the Diamond, up numerous first ascents in the Utah desert, and to China and Canada on ice climbing adventures, and partly a shared passion for showing others how fun it is to climb safe and strong.<br><br>I've been asked numerous times how I could continue climbing after losing a friend to the sport, and I'm sure people wonder how Craig's wife and daughter continue to climb after losing Craig. It's a good question, one I don't entirely know how to answer, but the best I can do to explain is that life is risky. Some people avoid nearly all risk. Some of them have high blood pressure. Some have strained relationships with their naturally risk-taking children. Some look back from old age with regrets about the things they didn't do when they were young. <br><br>To people like Craig and I, risk is part of life; it's how you manage the risk that matters. Rock climbing is the safest of the different genres of mountaineering, and modern climbing equipment and attentive technique make it quite reasonable to climb a hundred days a year for an entire lifetime and never have a serious accident. <br><br>In the end, that's what inspired me to pour my heart and soul into this new edition: Craig and I dedicated our lives to sharing the valuable methodology of calculated risk-taking. For much of our society, voluntary risk is a contradiction. For us, being bold while staying safe, teaching while learning, and taking risks while avoiding danger all make perfect sense - and those who have tied into a rope and discovered the beauty of climbing tend to agree.<br><br>I've climbed with many partners, including partners who were paraplegic, strong, weak, blind, obese, old, young, athletic, timid or fearless - and nearly every one of them found climbing to be one of the most rewarding experiences of their lives. <br><br>Perhaps my mountain guide father, Mike Donahue, put it best: "Life is not found by avoiding the doing; life is a mountain to be climbed."Accomplished climbing guide, author, and photographer, <b>Topher Donahue</b> was, at age 14, one of the youngest American climbing guides in history.

We recognize that being honest with our loved ones will only deepen our bonds and help us feel peace in being able to express our innermost thoughts. Why then is it so challenging for us to come as we are, however we are, when approaching God in prayer?&nbsp;In <i>Praying the Truth: Deepening Your Friendship with God through Honest Prayer</i>, William A. Barry, SJ, helps us deepen our friendship with God by examining how to approach God, at any time and with any problem, in complete honesty. Fr. Barry reflects on how secrecy can hurt families, the Church, and ourselves and how what we are keeping secret can get in the way of our connection with God. He acknowledges that we may fear God&#x2019;s reaction when revealing our most intimate truths; but just like with friendships, we risk not developing our relationship with God if we are dishonest about who we are and how we feel.&nbsp;<i>Praying the Truth </i>helps us realize that if we do not approach God in complete honesty, we may be holding back a part of ourselves that needs to be healed. By learning how to communicate honestly with God, our friendship with God and our faith in God&#x2019;s promise to love us unconditionally will be strengthened.<br><br> "Thanks to Praying the Truth, I am beginning to understand that prayer is simply hanging out with God!

Using an array of examples from Melville and Dostoyevsky to contemporary writers Paula Fox, Edward P. Jones, and Lorrie Moore, Baxter explains how fiction writers create those visible and invisible details, how what is displayed evokes what is not displayed.</p><p><i>The Art of Subtext</i> is part of <i>The Art of</i> series, a new line of books by important authors on the craft of writing, edited by Charles Baxter. Each book examines a singular, but often assumed or neglected, issue facing the contemporary writer of fiction, nonfiction, or poetry. <i>The Art of</i> series means to restore the art of criticism while illuminating the art of writing.</p></p><p><p><b>CHARLES BAXTER</b> is the author of ten books, including <i>The Feast of Love</i>, a finalist for the National Book Award, and <i>Burning Down the House: Essays on Fiction</i>. He teaches at the University of Minnesota and lives in Minneapolis.</p>Though there are passages where this slim, college-lecture-style volume turns facile or tiresome, novelist Baxter's analysis of "the implied, the half-visible, and the unspoken" in literature is saved from irrelevance by a keen sense of pacing and a healthy dose of self-awareness (after confidently zooming through seminal works by Herman Melville, John Cheever, and F. Scott Fitzgerald, Baxter confesses, "I feel that ... I am on the verge of what Walt Whitman calls 'a usual mistake.' I don't wish to simplify what is actually intricate"). Indeed, as the brief chapters of this little book build on each other, Baxter's observations-which initially seem more like interesting rhetorical devices than substantive arguments-gain clarity and momentum, and the accumulation of anecdotal asides about writers' workshops and former students turn them from annoying interjections into helpful indicators of Baxter's relationship with literature. Many of the issues raised in this volume are as old as the study of literature itself, but Baxter's ability to ask unusual and incisive questions of familiar topics (Why is the volatility of Dostoyevsky's characters so unpleasant? Why is it so difficult-and yet so vital-to describe facial features?) makes this little volume worthwhile for the engaged student of literature. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

This title is intended for those who might enjoy an engaging dialogue on abstract mathematical ideas, and those who might wish to experience how new mathematics is created.</p><p><p> Nearly 30 years ago, John Horton Conway introduced a new way to construct numbers. Donald E. Knuth, in appreciation of this revolutionary system, took a week off from work on <b>The Art of Computer Programming</b> to write an introduction to Conway's method. Never content with the ordinary, Knuth wrote this introduction as a work of fiction--a novelette. If not a steamy romance, the book nonetheless shows how a young couple turned on to pure mathematics and found total happiness. </p> <p> </p><blockquote>The book's primary aim, Knuth explains in a postscript, is not so much to teach Conway's theory as "to teach how one might go about developing such a theory." He continues: "Therefore, as the two characters in this book gradually explore and build up Conway's number system, I have recorded their false starts and frustrations as well as their good ideas. I wanted to give a reasonably faithful portrayal of the important principles, techniques, joys, passions, and philosophy of mathematics, so I wrote the story as I was actually doing the research myself."... It is an astonishing feat of legerdemain. An empty hat rests on a table made of a few axioms of standard set theory. Conway waves two simple rules in the air, then reaches into almost nothing and pulls out an infinitely rich tapestry of numbers that form a real and closed field. Every real number is surrounded by a host of new numbers that lie closer to it than any other "real" value does. The system is truly "surreal." <i>quoted from Martin Gardner, Mathematical Magic Show, pp. 16--19</i> </blockquote> <p></p> <p> <b>Surreal Numbers</b>, now in its 13th printing, will appeal to anyone who might enjoy an engaging dialogue on abstract mathematical ideas, and who might wish to experience how new mathematics is created. </p> <br> <br> 0201038129B04062001<p> <b>Donald E.

Although the idea of virginity is unpopular and even despised in modern society, Dubay emphasizes that the importance of evangelical virginity is rooted in its Biblical foundation, both in the Old and New Testaments. <p>Examining in detail what the call to virginity is and how it is integrated into the whole of consecrated life, Dubay presents his study in such a way as to be of importance to men as well. Noting that a woman, because of her feminine nature and traits, can image and live the Church's wedded relationship to Christ more realistically, Dubay points out that men with the celibate charism are also members of the virgin Church that is wedded to Christ, just as in the Old Testament the People of God was a virgin bride wedded to Yahweh. The common and distinct elements of male and female consecrated love are fully captured in these pages.</p></p><p>Fr. Thomas Dubay, S.M., is a retreat master and spiritual director for religious communities around the contry, as well as a highly regarded speaker at conferences and retreats for lay poeple in North America. He has hosted five different 13-part television series on the topics of spirituality and prayer, and is the best-selling author of such acclaimed spiritual works as Fire Within, Prayer Primer and Happy Are You Poor.</p><h2>Unexpected President</h2><p><b>When President James Garfield was shot in 1881, nobody expected Vice President Chester A. Arthur to become a strong and effective president, a courageous anti-corruption reformer, and an early civil rights advocate.</b><br><br>Despite his promising start as a young man, by his early fifties Chester A. Arthur was known as the crooked crony of New York machine boss Roscoe Conkling. For years Arthur had been perceived as unfit to govern, not only by critics and the vast majority of his fellow citizens but by his own conscience. As President James A. Garfield struggled for his life, Arthur knew better than his detractors that he failed to meet the high standard a president must uphold.<br><br>And yet, from the moment President Arthur took office, he proved to be not just honest but brave, going up against the very forces that had controlled him for decades. He surprised everyone--and gained many enemies--when he swept house and took on corruption, civil rights for blacks, and issues of land for Native Americans.<br><br>A mysterious young woman deserves much of the credit for Arthur's remarkable transformation. Julia Sand, a bedridden New Yorker, wrote Arthur nearly two dozen letters urging him to put country over party, to find "the spark of true nobility" that lay within him. At a time when women were barred from political life, Sand's letters inspired Arthur to transcend his checkered past--and changed the course of American history.<br><br>This beautifully written biography tells the dramatic, untold story of a virtually forgotten American president. It is the tale of a machine politician and man-about-town in Gilded Age New York who stumbled into the highest office in the land, only to rediscover his better self when his nation needed him.</p><p><b>Scott S.

When the encounter began the frontiers of Russia and British India lay some 2000 apart. By the end, the gap had shrunk in places to 20 miles. As Russia pushed forward her frontiers young officers found the fulfilment of their dreams in the chance to escape garrison life and find promotion and glory in the Caucasus, China and Tibet.;Peter Hopkirk has also written Foreign Devils on the Silk Road, Trespassers on the Roof of the World and Setting the East Ablaze.</p><p>In a phrase coined by Captain Arthur Connolly of the East India Company before he was beheaded in Bokhara for spying in 1842, a "Great Game" was played between Tsarist Russia and Victorian England for supremacy in Central Asia. At stake was the security of India, key to the wealth of the British Empire. When play began early in the 19th century, the frontiers of the two imperial powers lay two thousand miles apart, across vast deserts and almost impassable mountain ranges; by the end, only 20 miles separated the two rivals.<p> Peter Hopkirk, a former reporter for <i>The Times</i> of London with wide experience of the region, tells an extraordinary story of ambition, intrigue, and military adventure. His sensational narrative moves at breakneck pace, yet even as he paints his colorful characters--tribal chieftains, generals, spies, Queen Victoria herself--he skillfully provides a clear overview of the geographical and diplomatic framework. The Great Game was Russia's version of America's "Manifest Destiny" to dominate a continent, and Hopkirk is careful to explain Russian viewpoints as fully as those of the British. The story ends with the fall of Tsarist Russia in 1917, but the demise of the Soviet Empire (hastened by a decade of bloody fighting in Afghanistan) gives it new relevance, as world peace and stability are again threatened by tensions in this volatile region of great mineral wealth and strategic significance. <i>--John Stevenson</i></p>14 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>The Glory of Their Times: The Story of the Early Days of Baseball Told by the Men Who Played It</h2><p>Autobiographical accounts of accomplished baseball players of the early twentieth century</p><p>The voices of the game's distant past continue to reverberate with a distinct freshness in Lawrence S.

Amazingly, Burbank discovered independently the Mendelian principles that form the basis of genetics, and developed more than 800 varieties of fruits, nuts, vegetables and flowers. He made little money, largely owing to insufficient patent law (plants were not covered at the time) and his own paranoia, but he gained ample fame amid the 19th-century vogue for progress. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Taking us inside the New Orleans slave market, the largest in the nation, where 100,000 men, women, and children were packaged, priced, and sold, Walter Johnson transforms the statistics of this chilling trade into the human drama of traders, buyers, and slaves, negotiating sales that would alter the life of each. What emerges is not only the brutal economics of trading but the vast and surprising interdependencies among the actors involved. </p><p> Using recently discovered court records, slaveholders' letters, nineteenth-century narratives of former slaves, and the financial documentation of the trade itself, Johnson reveals the tenuous shifts of power that occurred in the market's slave coffles and showrooms. Traders packaged their slaves by "feeding them up," dressing them well, and oiling their bodies, but they ultimately relied on the slaves to play their part as valuable commodities. Slave buyers stripped the slaves and questioned their pasts, seeking more honest answers than they could get from the traders. In turn, these examinations provided information that the slaves could utilize, sometimes even shaping a sale to their own advantage. </p><p> Johnson depicts the subtle interrelation of capitalism, paternalism, class consciousness, racism, and resistance in the slave market, to help us understand the centrality of the "peculiar institution" in the lives of slaves and slaveholders alike. His pioneering history is in no small measure the story of antebellum slavery. </p></p><p>The slave pen lay at the depths of slavery&#39;s hell, and no one has explored that abyss better than Walter Johnson. Soul by Soul brilliantly bares the base meaning of chattel bondage and by extension antebellum Southern society byinspecting the mechanism that produced and reproduced slavery in the nineteenth-century United States and in the process defined slave, slave trader, and slaveholder.

She lives in Denver, Colorado. Recently she sat down with Maggie Stiefvater to discuss Stiefvater's <em>Ballad</em> and <em>The Wolves of Mercy Falls</em> series. Read the resulting interview below, or turn the tables to see what happened when Maggie interviewed Brenna. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> Even though we all know that characters are not authors, we also know that characters sort of are their authors (at least a little bit). Which of your characters would you say is most like you as a person? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Well, most of my characters are delightfully single-minded, because that is what characters do. So if I were arguing a high-level thesis paper, I&#x2019;d probably declare that, in fact, all of my characters are really me, just exaggerated, stripped of gray areas and less than crystal clear motivations. Even the evil ones. Maybe especially the evil ones. &gt;br/&gt; <br> That said, I&#x2019;ve been told I&#x2019;m quite like Isabel from the <i>Shiver</i> [<i>Wolves of Mercy Falls</i>] series and James from <i>Ballad</i>. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> If Cole from the <i>Shiver</i> trilogy and James from <i>Ballad</i> had to fight each other in a snark-off, who would win?</p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> James, I&#x2019;m afraid. Cole has learned to rely far too much on his appearance to win these things and sometimes, my friends, a finely crafted chin will just not get you ahead in life. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> When your characters are romantically involved, they&#x2019;re willing to fight desperately to be together, often against seemingly insurmountable odds. Like when their significant others turn into wolves and run away into the forest. Where do you stand on the topic of true love? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> I&#x2019;m a fan/ believer/ proponent of true love. I think it&#x2019;s worth waiting for, and I also think it&#x2019;s worth fighting for once you&#x2019;ve found it. I&#x2019;m one of those madly in love people who just doesn&#x2019;t understand why anyone would stand for anything less. I also find long-term dating confusing. I was engaged after a month and a half because, like Grace in <i>Shiver</i>, I am bad at shopping. I just see what I want, and then I go and get it. </p> <p></p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> Cole St. Clair&#x2019;s band Narkotika is, understandably, not a real band. However, if it were a real band, what would it sound like? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Well, I think that Narkotika, like love, is in the eye of the beholder. It&#x2019;s supposed to be an edgy, hard, slightly unsettling band, and that varies depending on what you listen to. Also, it was originally an electronica band (think Blaqk Audio). These days I go through life thinking that possibly they would sound like Ringside. Or Korn. Or Carolina Liar. Or Three Days Grace. I realize that these bands sound nothing like each other. I have no good explanation for that. </p> <p> <strong>Brenna:</strong> What would you say to all the woefully optimistic girls out there (i.e., me) who want to know if Cole would date them? What if they said please? </p> <p> <strong>Maggie:</strong> Oh, Cole would date you. I guarantee you he would date you. If by &#x201c;date,&#x201d; you mean &#x201c;make out with you in a dark hallway, remove some of your clothing, completely avoid giving you his contact information, disappear, and make you have a resulting existential crisis about why you date boys who treat you badly.&#x201d; <br> <br> The please wouldn&#x2019;t be necessary. </p>Maggie Stiefvater is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of the novels Shiver, Linger, Forever, and The Scorpio Races.

Jean, the youngest of the clan, grew up to be a world renowned folksinger. But she was hardly unique in the family. All the Ritchies sang&#x2015;when they worked, when they prayed, when they rejoiced, even when tragedy struck.<br><br><i>Singing Family of the Cumberlands</i> is both an appealing account of family life and a treasury of American folklore and folksong. In the deceptively simple but picturesque language of rural Kentucky, Jean Ritchie tells of a way of life now nearly vanished and of a gentle, upright people shielded from the outside world by forbidding mountain ranges, preserving the traditions of their forebears.<br><br>Foremost among those traditions were the British folksongs brought from England by James Ritchie in 1768. Even in a region noted for its wealth of folksongs, the Ritchies' inheritance was exceptional. Forty-two of the family's beloved songs are woven through Jean Ritchie's narrative, complete with words and often musical scores. Each song evokes a memory for Jean&#x2015;hoeing corn, stirring off molasses, telling ghost stories, singing a dying baby to its eternal rest. Songs lightened the burden of poverty for the Ritchies and brought them joy and solace.<br> <br>Illustrated by Maurice Sendak, <i>Singing Family of the Cumberlands</i> will delight readers in all walks of life.</p><p>"The forty-two songs included here (themselves worth the price of the book) form a pleasant assortment of English, Scottish, and Irish ballads and songs ranging in mood from the tragedy of 'Fair Ellender' and 'Lyttle Musgrave' to the light humor of 'Nottamun Town' and 'The Darby Ram.'...The Ritchies are rare people, of sturdy pioneer stock. Jean Ritchie sees them fondly, and the reader is likely to share her warmth."-New York Times Book Review <p>"Ritchie writes as she sings--naturally and with an instinctive sense for rhythms. Her story of her rearing in the hill-circled town of Viper is simple, vivid, and moving. . . . A beautiful story of American living."--New York Herald Tribune </p><p>"The rich headnotes and photographs speak to the regional culture, the history of the songs and the family's life of simple, enduring values." --Come-All-Ye </p><p>"What a pleasure it is to have this book back in print . . . each time I open it and re-read the lyrics, I can hear, in my mind' ear, Jean Ritchie's voice, as so many have heard it, clear, calm, and strong." --Paintsville Herald</p><b>Jean Ritchie</b> continues to perform at folk festivals, to record, and to publish music.</p><h2>Cold Warriors: Writers Who Waged the Literary Cold War</h2><p><p>A brilliant, invigorating account of the great writers on both sides of the Iron Curtain who played the dangerous games of espionage, dissidence and subversion that changed the course of the Cold War. <br><br>During the Cold War, literature was both sword and noose. Novels, essays and poems could win the hearts and minds of those caught between the competing creeds of capitalism and communism. They could also lead to exile, imprisonment or execution if they offended those in power. The clandestine intelligence services of the United States, Britain and the Soviet Union had secret agents and vast propaganda networks devoted to literary warfare. But the battles were personal, too: friends turning on each other, lovers cleaved by political fissures, artists undermined by inadvertent complicities. </p><p>In <em>Cold Warriors</em>, Harvard University&#x2019;s Duncan White vividly chronicles how this ferocious intellectual struggle was waged on both sides of the Iron Curtain. The book has at its heart five major writers&#x2014;George Orwell, Stephen Spender, Mary McCarthy, Graham Greene and Andrei Sinyavsky&#x2014;but the full cast includes a dazzling array of giants, among them Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, John le Carr�, Richard Wright, Ernest Hemingway, Boris Pasternak, Gioconda Belli, Arthur Koestler, Vaclav Havel, Joan Didion, Isaac Babel, Howard Fast, Lillian Hellman, Mikhail Sholokhov &#x2014;and scores more. </p><p>Spanning decades and continents and spectacularly meshing gripping narrative with perceptive literary detective work, <em>Cold Warriors</em> is a welcome reminder that, at a moment when ignorance is celebrated and reading seen as increasingly irrelevant, writers and books can change the world.</p><p><em>Cold Warriors</em> includes 20-30 black-and-white photographs.</p></p><p><p>Duncan White is an award-winning journalist and academic.

It will become a standard work on military intelligence tactics. And best of all, it reads like a novel!" -- Joseph S. Nye, Jr. Dean of the Kennedy School of Government, Harvard University <p>"Mr. Holt's history of Allied deception in World War II is definitive. He has trawled through all the documentation, interviewed all the survivors, and put together a history as comprehensive as it is readable and entertaining.

Lovett Professor of Military and Naval History, Yale University, and author of British Intelligence in the Second World War: Volume 5, Strategic Deception </p><p>"Thaddeus Holt has given us a riveting history of the Allied deception operations in World War II. The British were especially masterful -- the sphinxlike and sardonic Dudley Clarke and his colleagues had a huge hand in the victory. Far more dramatic than any fiction." -- R. James Woolsey Director of Central Intelligence, 1993-95 </p><p>"Just when you have convinced yourself that you have long ago imbibed the last word on the secret side of World War II, along comes Thaddeus Holt and his remarkable study.

Deeply researched and written with authority and verve, it tells the full story of Allied deception during World War II. The Deceivers not only recounts every major operation, it describes in detail how each operation affected the enemy. It will be essential for the bookshelf of every serious student of World War II." -- Ernest May Charles Warren Professor of History, Harvard University </p><p>"Thaddeus Holt's The Deceivers is an important contribution...the least that can be said about the book is that for the next several decades it should serve intelligence and defense communities as a bible about how to deceive an enemy in wartime....The finished product is as close to definitive as we are likely to see....Holt's narrative line will hold the reader's attention, carrying him through the occasional dense patches to leave him astounded by the end result. Invariably that result is a much more thorough knowledge for any reader about what was actually taking place at any particular moment during World War II." -- The Sewanee Review, Winter 2004 </p><p>"[A] monumental history. Holt fully reveals Allied attempts to "mystify, mislead, and surprise" the enemy, while identifying the intelligence failures, the successes and the many operations whose decisiveness remains unclear even today.

This is her story, and that of Ormus Cama, the lover who finds, loses, seeks and again finds her, over and over, throughout his own extraordinary life in music. The story of a love that stretches across their whole lives, and even beyond death. Their epic romance is narrated by Ormus&#39;s childhood friend and Vina&#39;s sometime lover, her &#34;back-door man&#34;, the photographer Rai, whose astonishing voice, filled with stories, images, myths, anger, wisdom, humour and love, is perhaps the books true hero. Telling the story of Ormus and Vina, he finds that he is also revealing his own truths: his human failings, his immortal longings. He is a man caught up in the loves and quarrels of the age&#39;s goddesses and gods, but dares to have ambitions of his own. And lives to tell the tale. Around these three, the uncertain world itself is beginning to tremble and break. Cracks and tears have begun to appear in the fabric of the real. There are glimpses of abysses below the surfaces of things. In the words of one of Ormus Cama&#39;s songs, it shouldn&#39;t be this way. The Ground Beneath Her Feet is Salman Rushdie&#39;s most gripping novel and his boldest imaginative act.</p><p>The ground shifts repeatedly beneath the reader's feet during the course of Salman Rushdie's sixth novel, a riff on the Orpheus and Eurydice myth set in the high-octane world of rock &amp; roll. Readers get their first clues early on that the universe Rushdie is creating here is not quite the one we know: Jesse Aron Parker, for example, wrote "Heartbreak Hotel"; Carly Simon and Guinevere Garfunkel sang "Bridge over Troubled Water"; and Shirley Jones and Gordon McRae starred in "South Pacific." And as the novel progresses, Rushdie adds unmistakable elements of science fiction to his already patented magical realism, with occasionally uneven results. <p> Rushdie's cunning musician is Ormus Cana, the Bombay-born founder of the most popular group in the world. Ormus's Eurydice (and lead singer) is Vina Apsara, the daughter of a Greek American woman and an Indian father who abandoned the family. What these two share, besides amazing musical talent, is a decidedly twisted family life: Ormus's twin brother died at birth and communicates to him from "the other side"; his older brothers, also twins, are, respectively, brain-damaged and a serial killer. Vina, on the other hand, grew up in rural West Virginia where she returned home one day to find her stepfather and sisters shot to death and her mother hanging from a rafter in the barn. No wonder these two believe they were made for each other. </p><p> Narrated by Rai Merchant, a childhood friend of both Vina and Ormus, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i> begins with a terrible earthquake in 1989 that swallows Vina whole, then moves back in time to chronicle the tangled histories of all the main characters and a host of minor ones as well. Rushdie's canvas is huge, stretching from India to London to New York and beyond--and there's plenty of room for him to punctuate this epic tale with pointed commentary on his own situation: Muslim-born Rai, for example, remarks that "my parents gave me the gift of irreligion, of growing up without bothering to ask people what gods they held dear.... You may argue that the gift was a poisoned chalice, but even if so, that's a cup from which I'd happily drink again." Despite earthquakes, heartbreaks, and a rip in the time-space continuum, <i>The Ground Beneath Her Feet</i> may be the most optimistic, accessible novel Rushdie has yet written. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p><p>"Dazzling--a wonderfully imagined and abundant novel about love and rock 'n' roll, about India and the United States, about gods and mortals, and about this crazy world we live in.-- Sheer joy." -M.G. Vassanji, The Globe and Mail</p> <p>"As absorbing as fiction can be -- and [from] one of our continent's best writers." -Kirkus Reviews</p> <p>"This is Rushdie at his absolute, almost insolently global best -- his adroit mastery of language serves brilliantly imagined characters and a mesmerizing narrative. Completely seductive." -Toni Morrison</p> <p>"[An] exuberant and elegiac new novel...his best since Midnight's Children." -The New York Times</p> <p>"Brilliant...unabashedly ambitious, playful, arch." -The Toronto Star</p> <p>"From start to finish, this massive novel is in every way major.--The writing is funny, silly, erudite, crude, precise, unbuttoned.--The fabulous and magical mix with the sordid and the profane; [the] plot is invariably advanced by catastrophe -- bizarre deaths and unexplained fires, multiple earthquakes.--Daring-- Extraordinary." -The Montreal Gazette</p> <p>"Magnificent, monstrously inventive--The most playful of masterpieces." -Mirabella</p> <p>"Salman Rushdie's new novel is a wonderful storytelling beast that feeds on pop culture, misfit history and the persistence of myth. Rushdie's epic range has never been more impressive. Here is a great novelist operating as a master of metamorphosis -- transforming life, art and language in the subterranean maze of his imagination." -Don DeLillo</p> <br></p><h2>The MacGregors: Robert &amp; Cybil: The Winning HandThe Perfect Neighbor</h2><p><br><br><em>Nora Roberts delights with two more classic tales about the beloved MacGregor clan and the risks they will take...all in the name of love!</em><br><br><em>The Winning Hand</em><br><br>When Darcy Wallace spends her last three dollars at the hotel casino and wins the jackpot, all casino manager Robert MacGregor Blade wants to do is protect her.

All it required was for her to keep buried every dream, every longing, every private wish.<br><br>It shouldn't have been hard. She'd been doing it all of her life. But it was.<br><br>Closing her eyes, she rested her forehead on the steering wheel. Why did Gerald want her so much? she wondered. There was nothing special about her. She had a good mind and an average face. Her own mother had described her just that way often enough. She didn't believe it was so much a physical attraction on Gerald's side, though she suspected he liked the fact she was a small woman of slight build. Easily dominated.<br><br>God, he frightened her.<br><br>She remembered how furious he'd been when she'd cut off her shoulder-length hair, snipping away until it was as short as a boy's.<br><br>Well, she liked it, she thought with a little spurt of defiance. And it was her hair, damn it, she added, pushing her fingers through choppily cut, toffee-colored locks.<br><br>They weren't married yet, thank the Lord. He had no right to tell her how to look, how to dress, how to behave. And now, if she could just hold on, he never would have that right.<br><br>She should never have agreed to marry him in the first place. She'd just been so tired, so afraid, so confused. Even though the regrets and the doubts had set in almost immediately, even though she'd given him back the ring and apologized, she might have gone through with it rather than stand up under his anger and live through the gossip of a broken engagement. But she'd discovered he'd manipulated her, that he was responsible for her losing her job, for the threat of eviction from her apartment.<br><br>He'd wanted her to buckle. And she'd nearly obliged him, she thought now as she wiped sweat from her face with the back of her hand.<br><br>The hell with it, she decided and pushed herself out of the car. So she had less than ten dollars, no transportation and a mile hike ahead of her. She was out from under Gerald's thumb. She was finally, at twenty-three, on her own.<br><br>Leaving her suitcase in the trunk, she grabbed the weighty tote that contained all that really mattered to her, then headed off on foot. She'd burned her bridges. Now it was time to see what was around that next corner.<br><br>It took her an hour to reach her destination. She couldn't have explained why she kept walking along Route 15, away from the scatter of motels, gas stations, and toward that shimmering Oz-like skyline of Vegas in the distance. She only knew she wanted to be there, inside that globe of exotic buildings and shapes where lights were twinkling like a carnival.<br><br>The sun was tipping down below the western peaks of the red mountains that ringed that glittering oasis. Her hunger had gone from grinding distress to a dull ache. She considered stopping for food, to rest, to drink, but there was something therapeutic about simply putting one foot in front of the other, her eyes on the tall, spectacular hotels glimmering in the distance.<br><br>What were they like inside? she wondered. Would everything be glossy and polished, colorful to the point of gaudy? She imagined an atmosphere of sex and gambling, desperation and triumph, with an underlying snicker of naughtiness. There would be men with hard eyes, women with wild laughs. She'd get a job in one of those opulent dens of indulgence and have a front row seat for every show.<br><br>Oh, how she wanted to live and see and experience.<br><br>She wanted the crowds and the noise, the hot blood and the cold nerves. Everything, everything that was the opposite of what she'd had before. Most of all she wanted to feel&#x2014;strong, ripping emotions, towering joys, vivid excitement. And she would write about it all, she determined, shifting the tote which, filled with her notebooks and manuscript pages, weighed like stone. She would write, tucked in some little room looking out at it all.<br><br>Stumbling with exhaustion, she tripped on a curb, then righted herself. The streets were crowded, everyone seemed to have somewhere to go. Even at dusk, the lights of the city winked and gleamed and beckoned: <em>Come in, take a chance, roll the dice.</em><br><br>She saw families of tourists&#x2014;fathers in shorts with legs pink from the unforgiving sun, children with wide eyes, mothers with the frantic look of sensory overload.<br><br>Her own eyes were wide, the golden brown glazed with fatigue. The man-made volcano erupted in the distance, drawing screams and cheers from the crowd who'd gathered to watch and making Darcy gape with glassy-eyed wonder. The noise smothered the odd buzzing in her ears as she was jostled by the crowd.<br><br>Dazed and dazzled, she wandered aimlessly, gawking at the huge Roman statues, blinking at the neon, passing by the spurting fountains that gushed with shifting colors. It was a wonderland, loud and gaudy and un-apologetically adult, and she was as lost and as fascinated as Alice.<br><br>She found herself standing in front of twin towers as white as the moon and joined together by a wide, curved bridge with hundreds of windows. Surrounding the building were seas of flowers, both wild and exotic, and pools of mirror-bright water fed by the rush of a terraced waterfall that tumbled from the topmost spear of a mountain.<br><br>Guarding the entrance to the bridge was an enormous&#x2014;five times larger than life&#x2014;Indian war chief astride a gold stallion. His face and bare chest were gleaming copper. His war bonnet flowed with winking stones of rich reds and blues and greens. In his hand he carried a lance with a diamond-bright tip that winked fire.<br><br>He's so beautiful, was all she could think, so proud and defiant.<br><br>She would have sworn the statue's dark eyes were alive, fixed on hers. Daring her to come closer, to go inside, to take her chances.<br><br>Darcy stepped into The Comanche on watery legs and swayed against the sudden rush of cool air.<br><br>The lobby was immense, the tile floors a bold geometric pattern of emerald and sapphire that made her head spin. Cacti and palms grew regally out of copper or pottery urns. Brilliant floral displays graced huge tables, the scent of the lilies so sweet it brought tears to her eyes.<br><br>She walked on, amazed by the waterfall that rushed down a stone wall into a pond filled with bright fish, the sparkling light that shimmered from huge crystal-and-gold chandeliers. The place was a maze of color and flash, brighter and more brilliant than any reality she'd known or any dream she'd imagined.<br><br>There were shops, the offerings in the windows as glittery as the chandeliers. She watched an elegant blonde debate between two diamond necklaces the way another might consider her choice of tomatoes.<br><br>A laugh bubbled up in Darcy's throat, forcing her to press a hand to her mouth to hold it in. It wasn't the time or place to be noticed, she warned herself. She didn't belong in such glamorous surroundings.<br><br>She turned the corner and felt her head reel at the sudden brassy sound of the casino. Bells and voices, the metallic rat-a-tat of coins falling on coins. Whirls and buzzes and hoots. The wave of energy pouring out brought a rush to her blood.<br><br>Machines were everywhere, shoulder to shoulder with their faces spinning with colors and shapes. People crowded around them, standing, sitting on stools, pulling coins from white plastic buckets and feeding the busy machines. She watched a woman press a red button, wait for the spin to end, then scream with delight as triple black bars lined up in the center. Money poured out into a silver bowl in a musical rush.<br><br>It made Darcy grin.<br><br>Here was fun, reckless and impulsive. Here were possibilities both grand and small. And life, loud, messy and hot.<br><br>She'd never gambled in her life, not with money. Money was something to be earned, saved and carefully watched. But her fingers slipped into her pocket where the last of her crumpled bills seemed to pulse with heat against her skin.<br><br>If not now, when? she asked herself with another bubbling giggle she could no longer quite control. What good was 9.37? It would buy her a meal, she told herself, gnawing on her lip. But then what?<br><br>Light-headed, her ears ringing oddly, she roamed the aisles, blinking owlishly at people and machines. They were willing to take a chance, she thought. That's why they were here.<br><br>Wasn't that why she was here?<br><br>Then she saw it. It stood alone, big and bright and fascinating. It stood taller than she, its wide face made up of stylized stars and moons. The handle was nearly as thick as her arm and topped with a shiny red ball.<br><br>It called itself Comanche Magic.<br><br>JACKPOT! it proclaimed in diamond-white lights that flashed on and off and made her dizzy. Ruby red dots flowed along a black strip. She stared, fascinated at the number showing within the blinking lights.<br><br>1,800,079.37<br><br>What an odd amount. Nine dollars and thirty-seven cents, she thought again, fingering the money in her pocket. Maybe it was a sign.<br><br>How much did it cost? she wondered. She stepped closer, blinked to clear her wavering vision and struggled to read the rules. It was a progressive machine, so the numbers would change and grow as players pumped in their money.<br><br>She could play for a dollar, she read, but that wouldn't get the jackpot even if she lined up the stars and moons on all three lines. To really play, she'd have to put in one dollar times three. Nearly all the money she had left in the world.<br><br><em>Take a chance,</em> a voice seemed to whisper slyly in her ear.<br><br><em>Don't be foolish.</em> This voice was prim, disapproving, and all too familiar. <em>You can't throw your money away.</em><br><br><em>Live a little.</em> There was excitement in the whisper, and seduction. <em>What are you waiting for?</em><br><br>"I don't know," she muttered. "And I'm tired of waiting."<br><br>Slowly, her eyes on the challenging face of the machine, Darcy dug into her pocket.<br><br></p><h2>The Worst Journey in the World: Antarctic, 1910-13</h2><p>The author recounts his experiences on Scott&#39;s last Antarctic expedition and describes the hardships of polar exploration</p><p>"Polar exploration is at once the cleanest and most isolated way of having a bad time that has ever been devised" wrote Apsley Cherry-Garrard in a deceptively jaunty introduction to this classic story of bravery and fortitude first published in 1922. The story he relates is of Scott's last expedition to the Antarctic. From its departure from England in 1910 to its arrival in New Zealand in 1913, it is one of the most famous and tragic in the annals of exploration. Driven by an obsession for scientific knowledge, these brave polar explorers embarked on a journey into the unknown, testing their endurance by pushing themselves to the ultimate physical and mental limits as they surveyed the striking and mammoth land that lay far to the south.<br>Cherry-Garrard was himself a member of the expedition that had two goals: to discover as much as was scientifically possible about the terrain and habitat of Antarctica, and to be the first to reach the South Pole. The party was plagued by bad luck, weather conditions of unanticipated ferocity, and the physical deterioration of the party on the last part of the journey. Confronted by the shattering knowledge that Roald Amundsen had reached the South Pole a month before them, Scott's party then had to negotiate the last, heroic part of their journey, a doomed attempt which has entered modern mythology.<br>The Worst Journey in the World is the inside story of this most famous of journeys and is truly one of the best and most moving books of travel ever written. Join Scott's expedition as he and his team venture deep into the frozen unknown. This volume is the second in the continuing series of Explorers Club Classic books.<br>APSLEY CHERRY-GARRARD (1886-1959) was one of the youngest members of Captain Scott's final expedition to the Antarctic which he joined to collect the eggs of the Emperor penguin. After the expedition, Cherry-Garrard served in the First World War and was invalided home. With the zealous encouragement of his neighbour, George Bernard Shaw, Cherry-Garrard wrote <b>The Worst Journey in the World</b> (1922) in an attempt to overcome the horror of the journey. As the years unravelled he faced a terrible struggle against depression, breakdown and despair, haunted by the possibility that he could have saved Scott and his companions.</p><h2>Guardians of Ga&#x2019;Hoole: The Rise of a Legend</h2><p><p>An owlet hatches out onto Stormfast Island and into a world torn by war. For one hundred years, his people have fought off enemy owls from the Ice Talons, but the tide has turned. An invasion is coming, one the Kielian League won't have the strength to resist. Soon the tyrant owl Bylyric will rule over everything, and no honorable owl will be safe. </p><p>Only the small owl from Stormfast stands between Bylyric and total victory. Lyze is not very impressive to look at, but he has a wild idea for a snake and owl strike unit that just might give the soldiers of the Kielian League the edge they need.</p><p>This is his story, the story of an ordinary owl who rose to become Ezylryb of the Great Tree. This is the story of what it takes to make a Guardian of Ga'Hoole.</p></p><p>Kathryn Lasky is the Newbery Honor-winning author of over one hundred books for children and young adults. Her beloved Guardians of Ga'Hoole fantasy series has more than seven million copies in print, and she is the author of the Daughters of the Sea series, the Wolves of the Beyond series, as well as A TIME FOR COURAGE and other Dear America titles. Kathryn has also written a number of critically acclaimed nonfiction titles, such as BEYOND THE BURNING TIME and TRUE NORTH. She lives with her husband in Cambridge, MA.<br>Gr 4&#x2013;6&#x2014;Readers of the "Guardians of Ga'Hoole" series (Scholastic) know Ezlyryb as Soren's mentor, the venerable strategist, and scientist of the Great Tree. In this prequel, the old owl tells how he came to renounce war and become the great teacher of Ga'Hoole. Born in the North Kingdoms during the War of the Ice Talons, young Lyze is eager to join the cadets and become a great warrior like his parents. When he arrives at the Academy, however, he learns that the current battle techniques are no longer effective in against the invading forces-and there are far too many hidebound traditionalists in the officer corps. The young bird proposes a new concept-a fighting unit that includes not only owls, but also snakes and snow leopards. But, can such different creatures learn to work in an alliance before the Ice Talon invasion destroys everything? The narrative ranges from a charming and humorous account of owl chick childhood to thrilling battles to deep, personal tragedy and spiritual renewal. There are also subtle messages about tolerance and respect for individuality. Other characters from the series make appearances, including Ezylryb's lost mate Lil, his friend and companion; blind nest-maid snake Octavia; and Thora, a female owl blacksmith. Owl languages, songs, and legends add depth and realism to the fantasy. Fans of Ga'Hoole will welcome this new adventure.&#x2014;Elaine E.

Klein sometimes lets his idea of what is literary obtrude on his storytelling; all in all, however, these are among the best the genre has to offer. These tales are not for gore-fest fans; the horrors generally do not get detailed descriptions. But readers who are admirers of Lovecraft will recognize the master's influence. "Black Man with a Horn" is a direct tribute to the Lovecraft tradition. In "Petey," middle-aged angst provides the background for a more concrete terror; "Children of the Kingdom" is an interesting experiment with horror in an urban setting; and "Nadelman's God," a black comedy about the nihilistic follies of idols, is excellent. So advise readers to avoid those dark paths and enjoy the shivers.

In spite of her commendable efforts to rehabilitate her husband&#x2019;s name, Peggy Shippen continues to be remembered as a traitor bride. <br><br> Peggy&#x2019;s patriotic counterpart was Lucy Flucker, the spirited and voluptuous brunette, who in 1774 defied her wealthy Tory parents by marrying a poor Boston bookbinder simply for love. When her husband, Henry Knox, later became a famous general in the American Revolutionary War, Lucy faithfully followed him through Washington&#x2019;s army camps where she birthed and lost babies, befriended Martha Washington, was praised for her social skills, and secured her legacy as an admired patriot wife. <br><br> And yet, as esteemed biographer Nancy Rubin Stuart reveals, a closer look at the lives of both spirited women reveals that neither was simply a &#x201c;traitor&#x201d; or &#x201c;patriot.&#x201d; In <i>Defiant Brides</i>, the first dual biography of both Peggy Shippen Arnold and Lucy Flucker Knox,<i> </i>Stuart has crafted a rich portrait of two rebellious women who&nbsp;defied expectations and struggled&#x2014;publicly and privately&#x2014;in a volatile political moment in early America.<br><br> Drawing from never-before-published correspondence, Stuart traces the evolution of these women from passionate teenage brides to mature matrons, bringing both women from the sidelines of history to its vital center. Readers will be enthralled by Stuart&#x2019;s dramatic account of the epic lives of these defiant brides, which begin with romance, are complicated by politics, and involve spies, disappointments, heroic deeds, tragedies, and personal triumphs.</p><p><b><b>Nancy Rubin Stuart</b>&nbsp;</b>is an award-winning author specializing in women&#x2019;s and social history.

Fortunately enough of the correspondence of Lucy Flucker Knox (1760&#x2013;1824) and Margaret (Peggy) Shippen Arnold (1760&#x2013;1804) has been preserved to trace their controversial marriages and dramatic lives.<br><br> Born four years apart to wealthy parents in pre&#x2013;Revolutionary Boston and Philadelphia, Lucy and Peggy were intelligent, well-educated girls. As each developed into an attractive teenager in the mid-1770s, the political ferment of the American Revolution reached the boiling point. In the midst of that turmoil, both might have married men of their privileged class and led docile, if historically invisible, lives.<br><br>Thankfully that did not happen. As the title of this double biography, <i>Defiant Brides: The Untold Story of Two Revolutionary-Era Women and the</i> <i>Radical Men They Married</i>, implies both teenagers bucked social convention. One married radical patriot and poor bookseller Henry Knox in 1774; the other wed the then-military hero Benedict Arnold in 1779. Coupled with the young women&#x2019;s fateful marriages was their feistiness. Under different circumstances, Lucy and Peggy might have become friends. <br><br>For generations, the books devoted to the Founding Fathers and the Revolution&#x2019;s military leaders have dismissed both women as mere footnotes to history, either as laughable or trivial helpmates married to Knox and Arnold. A close examination of their lives tells quite a different story, revealing Lucy and Peggy as remarkably resilient women who intimately witnessed and participated in the Revolution&#x2019;s turbulent course. The same spirit that impelled the annually pregnant Lucy to follow Henry Knox through the Revolution&#x2019;s army camps also drove her mirror opposite, Peggy, to support Arnold&#x2019;s betrayal of America and subsequently troubled life in England and the loyal colonies in North America later known as Canada.<br><br>Superficially Lucy&#x2019;s patriotism seems as commendable as Peggy&#x2019;s treason is condemnable. Yet that is not quite fair. For all our glorification of its origins, the Revolution was not universally supported by the American colonists. An estimated one-third of those living in America&#x2019;s thirteen states in the years following the Battle of Lexington and Concord doubted the wisdom of independence from the mother country. Some citizens remained Loyalists. Others, unnerved by the economic hardships of the war, hedged, declaring themselves neutralists. It was thus natural that as an enamored eighteen-year-old bride, Lucy would side with her husband, Henry Knox, to support the American Revolution. It was equally understandable that the teenaged Peggy Shippen would sympathize with her politically disappointed bridegroom, Benedict Arnold, to betray America to the British. <br><br>That twinned blend of youthful defiance and dedication to their men, though a hallmark of adolescent passion in any age, drew me to research the lives of Lucy Flucker Knox and Peggy Shippen Arnold in the context of the American Revolution. At first I suspected that the two women must have met. Arnold, after all, had gallantly escorted Lucy and her toddler from New Haven in late spring 1778 to join her husband in Valley&nbsp;Forge. <br><br>Eight months later, Henry Knox rode to Philadelphia to meet with Congress. From there he enthusiastically wrote his brother about Arnold&#x2019;s engagement to the wealthy, beautiful, and accomplished Peggy Shippen. Lucy, however, had not accompanied him; then in the last weeks of pregnancy, she had remained in the Knoxes&#x2019; temporary home near the Middlebrook army camp. As their lives diverged, the two women had no other occasion to meet, although they knew about each other through their husbands. Nor have letters between Lucy and Peggy subsequently been discovered.<br> <i><br>Defiant Brides</i>, nevertheless, traces Lucy and Peggy&#x2019;s initially parallel lives, from those as smitten newlyweds to mature wives and mothers. While researching this book I found several frustrating gaps in each of set of their correspondences. Lucy rarely wrote to anyone other than her husband, and then only when separated from him during the war. Today, most of her letters are preserved in archives, especially at the Gilder Lehrman Institute and the Massachusetts Historical Society.<br><br>Peggy&#x2019;s correspondence from her youth and the early years of her marriage was lost, a consequence of Shippen&#x2019;s decision to destroy it to protect her from accusations as Arnold&#x2019;s co-conspirator. Fortunately, the Shippen family began saving Peggy&#x2019;s letters after the September 1783 Peace of Paris, which formalized the British surrender. Today the Historical Society of Pennsylvania retains Peggy&#x2019;s correspondence from the last twenty-one years of her life. Many of those letters also appear in Lewis Burd Walker&#x2019;s 1900&#x2013;1902 series in the <i>Pennsylvania Magazine of History and Biography.</i> <br><br>During the Revolution, Lucy and Peggy stood on opposite sides of the political schism, one as a staunch patriot, the second as a spy; one in shabby homespun, the other in silken English gowns; one in a log hut, the second in a luxurious townhouse; unwitting counterparts who lived dramatically different lives in the service of connubial love.<br><br>As women, their personal evolutions also stand in sharp relief. Subsequent to the Revolution, the exiled Peggy endured hisses and taunts as a suspected accomplice to Arnold&#x2019;s treason; crossed the Atlantic three times; excused her husband&#x2019;s public, often fractious enmities with peers and business associates; and, after his 1801 death, resolutely paid off his debts. During those same years, Lucy&#x2019;s devotion to Knox, her legendary hospitality, the deaths of ten of her children, and her obsession with cards transformed her into a superficially formidable, but ultimately sympathetic, character.<br><br>Their attitudes towards their husbands were equally contrasted. Although lamenting her separations from Knox during the war, Lucy refused to be intimidated by his promotions as General George Washington&#x2019;s chief of artillery and brigadier-general of the Continental army. In one of her letters, written during the siege of New York in 1777, she insisted upon having an equal voice in their marriage. Bluntly, she wrote that Knox must not &#x201c;consider yourself as commander in chief of your own house, but be convinced . . . that there is such a thing as equal command.&#x201d;<br><br>1.&nbsp;In contrast was Peggy&#x2019;s solicitous attitude towards Arnold&#x2014;&#x201c;the General,&#x201d; as she referred to him. During the tense days preceding a July 1792 duel in London between the contentious Arnold and the feckless Earl of Lauderdale, the frightened Peggy practiced restraint. To do so, as she later wrote her father, Judge Edward Shippen, in Philadelphia, had required &#x201c;all my fortitude . . . [to] prevent [me from] . . . sinking under it, which would unman him [Arnold] and prevent his acting himself.&#x201d;<br><br>2.&nbsp;Their marital styles were as significant as their political sensibilities. As the following pages reveal, Lucy, for all her patriotism and personal losses, was a temperamental, often difficult mate; Peggy, a shrewd accomplice to Arnold&#x2019;s treason, endured emotional and fi nancial hardships with genteel restraint. It was my hope that their pairing in <i>Defiant Brides </i>would transcend the coincidence of their &#x201c;defiant&#x201d; marriages to reveal how lapses in one of them inadvertently highlighted admirable traits in the other.<br><br>Is treason or betrayal of others forgivable if the rest of that person&#x2019;s life seems admirable?

It&#x2019;s a very hard thing to get, mind you. You might have a book where the words are lovely and the pictures exciting, but if the two don&#x2019;t work in tandem then your end product is going to end up a merely okay bit of indistinguishable dribble. A hint of what might have been will hover over the reading experience. I mention this because I&#x2019;m trying to find a way to explain why Amandina by Sergio Ruzzier is as delicately miraculous as it is. Maybe it has something to do with the fact that it&#x2019;s a Neal Porter book and Mr. Porter is known for helping to bring perfect little books into the world (see: Dog and Bear). Maybe it has to do with author/illustrator Sergio Ruzzier, whose previous books and collaborations have played effectively with tone and story. Maybe it&#x2019;s the thickness of the paper or the shade of the watercolors. Maybe it&#x2019;s everything altogether or maybe it&#x2019;s none of this at all.

But in the 1950s and 1960s, they were a pop culture phenomenon. The Great Books of Western Civilization, fifty-four volumes chosen by intellectuals at the University of Chicago, began as an educational movement, and evolved into a successful marketing idea. Why did a million American households buy books by Hippocrates and Nicomachus from door-to-door salesmen? And how and why did the great books fall out of fashion?<p>In <i>A Great Idea at the Time</i> Alex Beam explores the Great Books mania, in an entertaining and strangely poignant portrait of American popular culture on the threshold of the television age. Populated with memorable characters, <i>A Great Idea at the Time</i> will leave readers asking themselves: Have I read Lucretius's <i>De Rerum Natura</i> lately? If not, why not?</p></p><p><b>Alex Beam</b> is an award-winning columnist for the <i>Boston Globe</i>.

Led by the "intellectual Mutt 'n' Jeff act" of former University of Chicago president Robert Hutchins and his sidekick Mortimer Adler, the Great Books briefly, and improbably, caught the nation's imagination. In his discussion, Boston Globe columnist Beam looks at how and why this multi-year project took shape, what it managed to accomplish (or not), and the lasting effects it had on college curricula (in the familiar form of Dead White Males). Beam (Gracefully Insane: Life and Death Inside America's Premier Mental Hospital) describes meetings endured by the selection committee, and countless debates over Euripedes, Herodotus, Shakespeare, Melville, Dickens and Whitman ("When it comes to Great Books, no one is without an opinion."), but tells it like it is regarding the Syntopicon they devised-at "3,000 subtopics and 163,000 separate entries, not exactly a user-friendly compendium"-and the resulting volumes, labeling them "icons of unreadability-32,000 pages of tiny, double-column, eye-straining type." By lauding the intent and intelligently critiquing the outcome, Beam offers an insightful, accessible and fair narrative on the Great Books, its time, and its surprisingly significant legacy. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Bordhi has the unique ability to see in an object something completely different from what you or I may see. This book stems from one such observation: The arch stitches in socks don&#39;t need to go where we&#39;ve always put them. With a little understanding, you can put those stitches anywhere within the arch area - for example, in an orderly column or placed randomly - with equally successful results. Bordhi outlines eight sock architectures based on this principle, with master patterns that can be customized for any foot, yarn type, or needle, in any size ranging from infant to large adult. More than twenty additional patterns round out the collection. This is just book one . . .

Using the Roman empire as its central example, this classic work reveals how overexpansion and the exhaustion of available natural resources have played key roles in the collapse of all great cultures in human history. With an argument of urgent relevance to our modern society, <i>A Green History of the World</i> offers a provocative and illuminating view of human history and its relationship to the environment.</p><p><b>Clive Ponting</b> is the author of several books on world history.A comprehensive assessment of humanity's assault on the environment across the centuries, by British historian Ponting (University College, Swansea). Examining the interaction between societies and their surroundings from the earliest hunter-gatherer groups on, Ponting describes the first great leap of civilization--the development of crops and agriculture--as the start of a systematic environmental transformation. As groups settled near their fields and as populations grew, the burden on the land increased, and at times the ecological pressure grew too great. Crop irrigation, the author says, led to increased salination and diminished yields, while a loss of forest cover brought erosion and the destruction of precious arable land. The Sumerian civilization in the Middle East and the Mayans of Central America, among others, fell victim to these limits to growth, with the collapse in some cases being precipitous. Other societies survived, however, to participate in the more recent great transition involving the use of fossil fuels for energy. With this step, Ponting says, environmental degradation increased exponentially through pollution at all stages of the industrialization process--and, in addition, the industrialized societies, by their exploitation of others less advanced, created the Third World, with its Pandora's Box of poverty, overpopulation, and other social ills that continue to worsen today. Ponting suggests no solutions, marking instead the devastating course of human progress and the ruins that serve as its milestones. Few colorful anecdotes, but an impressive accumulation of evidence culled from the annals of recorded history: a sobering view of a planet deeply in peril.

As a writer, I know that inspiration can come from many different places&#x2014; a quote, a childhood experience, the sky is the limit. What inspired you to write this novel? </p> <p><strong>Wiley Cash:</strong> Thanks, Adriana. I&#x2019;d like to congratulate you on the success of <em>The Shoemaker&#x2019;s Wife</em>. The inspiration for this novel kind of found me. In the fall of 2003 I left North Carolina and moved to Lafayette, Louisiana, to attend graduate school. One night, in a class on African-American literature, my professor brought in a news story about a young African-American boy with autism who was smothered in a healing service on the south side of Chicago. I found the story incredibly tragic, but I was also interested in a community of believers that would literally believe something to death. I felt compelled to tell this boy&#x2019;s story and the story of the community surrounding him.</p> <p><strong>AT:</strong>Truth be told, I&#x2019;m a big fan of the &#x2019;80s&#x2014;big hair, some of the best music of all time&#x2014;what&#x2019;s not to like! Why did you choose to set your novel during this era? Do you see this particular time period as having an important resonance for contemporary America?</p> <p><strong>WC:</strong> The easiest answer is that Jess Hall, one of my three narrators, is nine years old in 1986. I was nine in 1986, and it was easy for me to remember how I viewed the world as a nine year old. But I soon realized that the &#x2019;80s were a very complicated decade, and I have clear memories of trying to make sense of a lot of the things that I was seeing and hearing at church, at school, and at home. </p> <p>When I sat down to write A Land More Kind Than Home I recalled how things seemed in the church and in the community when I was a kid, and I balanced that seeming against the reality of being. This conflict between seeming and being&#x2014;not just in churches but in families as well&#x2014;is what drives much of the novel.</p> <p><strong>AT: </strong>One of the things I love most about this novel is that it&#x2019;s told from very different perspectives&#x2014;from a young boy to a woman in her eighties to a middle-aged sheriff. As readers can see from your author photo you don&#x2019;t fit any of these criteria. Did you find it difficult to write from such different viewpoints?</p> <p><strong>WC:</strong> At first it was difficult to imagine the role each of these narrators would play in the novel. As I grew to know these characters better, I realized that each possessed a particular knowledge about the tragedy involving the young boy, and I understood that each of them viewed it from a very different perspective. This story belongs to the community, and I had to let the community tell it. </p> <p><strong>AT: </strong>I&#x2019;m a huge fan of book clubs. In my mind, there&#x2019;s nothing better than getting together to discuss your favorite book over a glass of wine. Are there any particular themes that book clubs might enjoy exploring in your book?</p> <p><strong>WC:</strong> I think book clubs are wonderful too, and there are a lot of issues in <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em> for book clubs to discuss: the power of faith, community responsibility, family secrets, marriage and infidelity. A lot of book clubs have wanted to talk about the role of the boys&#x2019; mother in the novel: Was she a good mother who believed her son could be healed, or was she a bad mother who invited tragedy upon her family?</p><p>A stunning debut reminiscent of the beloved novels of John Hart and Tom Franklin, <em>A Land More Kind Than Home</em> is a mesmerizing literary thriller about the bond between two brothers and the evil they face in a small western North Carolina town</p><p>For a curious boy like Jess Hall, growing up in Marshall means trouble when your mother catches you spying on grown-ups.

Now, drawing on sources newly available since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the reunification of Germany, historian and journalist Chris Bellamy presents the first full account of this deadly conflict.<br><br>Bellamy outlines the lead-up to the war&#x2014;in which the fragile alliance between Hitler and Stalin was unceremoniously broken&#x2014;and takes us headlong into the hostilities. He presents a shocking picture of battle in which the traditional restraints of &#x201c;civilized&#x201d; warfare were shed. He makes clear how the Soviets quickly rallied against Hitler, choosing homegrown despotism over foreign domination in a struggle that the Russian people call the Great Patriotic War.<br><br>Bellamy charts the early gains of the German army, whose advances into Soviet territory were brought to a halt in Moscow in the winter of 1941, and whose defeat was sealed in the Battle of Stalingrad, the most merciless campaign of the bloodiest front. He shows how Soviet men&#x2014;and women&#x2014;joined to fight a war whose casualties were later steeply underestimated by their government, and how even the true death toll, at 27 million, does not take into account the millions of lives on both sides that lay shattered in the aftermath.<br><br>Finally, Bellamy examines the far-reaching consequences of the battle&#x2019;s outcome&#x2014;the reverberations of which are still felt today&#x2014;and argues that the cost of victory was ultimately too much for the Soviet Union to bear.<br><br>A magisterial study, and an essential addition to our understanding of contemporary world history.</p><p>Chris Bellamy is Professor of Military Science and Doctrine and Director of the Security Studies Institute at Cranfield University.

Rabies is endemic in many parts of the world. A bite with infected saliva transmits the virus &#x2013; which can kill horribly &#x2013; to domestic animals, or to humans. The United Kingdom authorities feared the disease might leap the natural defensive barrier of the Channel and reappear in the UK, which had long been rabies-free because of strict quarantine regulations. Scientists agreed that the virus, transmitted in the wild mainly by wolves and foxes, had been spreading westwards through Europe since the end of the Second World War in 1945. In 1967, there were 2,775 reported cases in West Germany, and the first 199 cases in Switzerland. In 1968 it reached France, with 60 cases reported.1 It was clear that the epizootic &#x2013; the animal equivalent of a human epidemic &#x2013; had headed remorselessly westward, rather than east, north or south, since the war. Why?<br><br>It started when rabies-crazed wolves and foxes had fled the fighting on the Second World War's eastern front, as the Germans were pushed westward by the advancing Red Army from 1943 to 1945.2 The 'Iron Curtain' between East and West established after the war is known to have been an effective barrier to animals, as well as to people.3 The maddened creatures carrying rabies had clearly moved west before the Iron Curtain descended at the end of the war, and, understandably, kept going. And now, a quarter of a century later, the environmental effects of that war were lapping at the Channel and threatening the UK.<br><br>If the fighting on the eastern front had that effect on mad wolves and foxes, and on the natural environment, what effect must it have had on the millions of people from the sophisticated, educated and civilized nations of central and eastern Europe? A war 'hideous beyond imagining', not only unprecedented in its scale and violence, but 'befouled by and drenched in criminality'?4<br><br>In the late 1960s, the rabies scare was not the greatest concern for western European and UK security, however. The biggest threat - and it was very real then - was that of global thermonuclear war. Whoever might have started such a conflict, the missiles falling on western Europe, the UK and the US would probably have come from the Soviet Union. And the Soviet Union had become a world nuclear-missile-armed power as a direct result of the war in the East.<br><br>This book is the story of that war. The greatest, most costly and most brutal war on land in human history. It was fought between the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany for 1,418 days, from 22 June 1941 to 9 May 1945, on a front from the Arctic Circle to the Caucasus, from the Barents Sea to the Black Sea, up to 3,200 kilometres long. Three months to the day after it ended, as promised, on 8-9 August 1945, the Soviet Union attacked a million-strong Japanese army in Manchuria and made it surrender in eight days, although fighting continued in Manchuria and the Kurile islands until 1 September.5<br><br>Soviet casualties in that 1941-5 period are now estimated at 27 million direct deaths, military and civilian. That is nearly half the total losses resulting from the Second World War. But the 'global loss' to the Soviet population &#x2013; the difference between the population after the war and the population as it should have been, had the war not taken place, may be 48 to 49 million. Germany probably lost 4.3 million military dead as a direct result of the battles in the East.6 And these gures do not include the invisible legacy of wars, which we are only now coming to recognize: the psychological casualties, and the victims afflicted by nervous disorders and post-traumatic stress, and the consolations those people seek.<br><br>Another gruesome by-product of the war in the East was an intensification of Nazi persecution of the Jews and the 'final solution', which only reached its final, obscene dimensions after 1941. The Holocaust had begun before this &#x2013; alert British newspapers were reporting deportation of German Jews in the 1930s, although many Jews were able to emigrate. However, the German Barbarossa offensive through central and eastern Europe brought millions more Jews under German control. Hitler had identified the Bolsheviks, who ruled the Soviet Union, with the Jews, even though the Soviet government's attitude to its own Jewish population showed it to be unashamedly anti-Semitic. But now Hitler's delusions were compounded by a perverted and superstitious logic. With so many Aryans being killed on the eastern front, extermination of the Jews and other 'undesirables' had to be stepped up to balance the books. The Red Army and the NKVD were not squeamish, but when they liberated Auschwitz in January 1945, even they were flabbergasted.7<br><br>From 1944 the Soviet Union called its victorious war against Nazi Germany from 1941 to 1945 the 'Great Patriotic War', an exponentially greater sequel to the 'Patriotic War' of 1812 against Napoleon (although the latter term was used until then). Many comparisons have been and can be made between the two wars, with Russia, itself autocratic and authoritarian, fighting two of the most flamboyant dictators in history - Napoleon, then Hitler. However repressive the indigenous regime, whether under the Tsar or the red star, the majority of the people (though far from all) rallied to it, preferring home-grown despotism to anything imposed from abroad. (There is a lesson here for those who like exporting their idea of democracy today.) Both conflicts saw 'war to the knife', as well as the biggest conventional battles of the age. The Russians scorched the earth as they withdrew, buying victory at terrible cost. And then came revenge, culminating in occupation of the enemy capital. After the defeat of Nazi Germany, at the Potsdam conference in July 1945, Averill Harriman, the US Ambassador to Moscow, congratulated Josef Stalin on the achievement of his forces in reaching the Nazi capital, Berlin. 'Alexander I got to Paris,' replied Stalin, laconically - a reference to the occupation of Paris by Russian troops in 1815.8<br><br>Napoleon's ill-advised invasion of Russia in 1812 was only one of a number of campaigns which sealed his fate in a coalition world war. The Soviet Union's role in the Second World War, likewise, was only one part of the complex jigsaw of victory.<br><br>The Second World War was not a single conflict, but formed from a number of quite separate wars which fused as the world's leading military and economic powers were drawn in. The first war, which began with Germany's invasion of Poland (with Soviet approval) on 1 September 1939, was an old-fashioned 'cabinet war' for the European balance of power. The second war involved Germany's ally, Italy, and was about Italian attempts to establish dominion in the Mediterranean and north Africa. The 1939-40 Soviet-Finnish war and the occupation of the Baltic States and Bessarabia in 1940 were also relatively conventional affairs, their purpose being to secure Leningrad, the Soviet Union's second city, and other parts of the Soviet Union's western frontier. The Soviet Union's tightening grip on eastern Europe precipitated the third major war, the greatest and bloodiest, and the subject of this book. Hitler needed the natural resources, manpower and living space of the Soviet Union to secure Germany's position as a world power. But Nazism had also grown as a response to the perceived threat from communism, and that conflict, too, was played out in this vast theatre. It was the collision of two dictatorships in a land that had spread in a vast plain across half the world, which the geopoliticians believed to be the Eurasian 'heartland'. The fourth great war, between Japan and the other imperial powers, had its origins in Japan's invasion of China in 1937, but became part of the world war on 7 December 1941.9 Reluctant though the isolationist United States had been to become engaged in the entangling alliances, within four years it emerged from the war as one of two world military, scientific and economic 'superpowers'. The other one was the Soviet Union.<br><br>Without British and US dominance at sea, the strategic air campaign and the war in the Pacific, it is very possible that the Soviet Union would have been defeated in 1942 or that, at the very least, the war in the East would have gone on much longer.10 Nevertheless, during the critical period of late 1941 and all of 1942, American power was only starting to be engaged and the Allied strategic bombing offensive against Germany was just beginning to get under way, as the latter's greatest exponent, Air Chief Marshal Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, confirmed.11 Of all the interwoven strands, the war on the eastern front was probably the crucial military, economic and political struggle of the Second World War. It certainly was between mid 1941 and mid-to-late 1943, as the war's outcome hung in the balance.12 After that, the western Allies were ashore in mainland Europe following the invasion of Sicily, which coincided with the last major German offensive in the East at Kursk, and the Japanese were being pushed back in the Pacific. The failure of Barbarossa, which became apparent during 1942, created the conditions for the initiative to pass to the Allies at the end of 1942.13 For that reason, this book pays particular attention to that period and especially to 1942.<br><br>It was not for nothing that, as early as January 1943, with uncanny prescience, the American Time magazine named Josef Stalin as its 'man of the year' for 1942 (see Plate 4).14 With hindsight, the Soviet dictator seems a bizarre choice for Americans to have made. But it underlines the scale of the Soviet achievement in that precarious year.<br><br>Winston Churchill, the British war leader, who hated communism and was no lover of the Russians, similarly acknowledged their pivotal role in the war. In a speech to the UK Parliament in 1944 his analysis was razor sharp:<br></p><h2>Back in the Day Bakery Made with Love: More than 100 Recipes and Make-It-Yourself Projects to Create and Share</h2><p>Cheryl and Griffith Day, authors of the <i>New York Times</i> bestselling <i>Back in the Day Bakery Cookbook</i>, are back with more recipes to make with love.

He had recently, begrudgingly, taken a position at a nearby private college (far too expensive for local kids to attend) teaching art history, and moved his family into a tight-knit, impoverished town that has lately been discovered by wealthy outsiders in search of a rural idyll.&nbsp;<br><br> George is of course the immediate suspect&#x2014;the question of his guilt echoing in a story shot through with secrets both personal and professional. While his parents rescue him from suspicion, a persistent cop is stymied at every turn in proving Clare a heartless murderer. And three teenage brothers (orphaned by tragic circumstances) find themselves entangled in this mystery, not least because the Clares had moved into their childhood home, a once-thriving dairy farm.

Half past five in the afternoon. Almost dark. She had just laid out their plates when the dogs started barking.</p><p>Her husband set down his fork and knife, none too pleased to have his supper interrupted. What&#x2019;s that now?</p><p>June Pratt pulled aside the curtain and saw their neighbor. He was standing there in the snow, holding the child, her feet bare, neither of them in coats. From the looks of it, the little girl was in her pajamas. It&#x2019;s George Clare, she said.</p><p>What&#x2019;s he selling?</p><p>I wonder. I don&#x2019;t see a car. They must&#x2019;ve come on foot.</p><p>Awful cold out. You better see what he wants.</p><p>She let them in with the cold. He stood before her, holding the child out like an offering.</p><p>It&#x2019;s my wife. She&#x2019;s&#x2014;-</p><p>Momma hurt, the child cried.</p><p>June didn&#x2019;t have children of her own, but she had raised dogs her whole life and saw the same dark knowing in the child&#x2019;s eyes that confirmed what all animals understood, that the world was full of evil and beyond comprehension.</p><p>You&#x2019;d better call the police, she told her husband. Something&#x2019;s happened to his wife.</p><p>Joe pulled off his napkin and went to the phone.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s go find you some socks, she said, and took the child from her father and carried her down the hall to the bedroom where she set her on the bed. Earlier that afternoon, she had laid her freshly laundered socks over the radiator, and she took a pair now and pushed the warm wool over the child&#x2019;s feet, thinking that if the child were hers she&#x2019;d love her better.</p><p>They were the Clares. They had bought the Hale place that summer, and now winter had come and there were just the two houses on the road and she hadn&#x2019;t seen them much. Sometimes in the morning she would. Either when he raced past in his little car to the college. Or when the wife took the child out of doors. Sometimes, at night, when June walked the dogs, you could see inside their house. She could see them having supper, the little girl between them at the table, the woman getting up and sitting down and getting up again.</p><p>With the snow, it took over a half--hour for the sheriff to arrive. June was vaguely aware, as women often are of men who desire them, that Travis Lawton, who had been her classmate in high school, found her attractive. That was of no consequence now, but you don&#x2019;t easily forget the people you grew up with, and she made a point of listening carefully to him, and acknowledged his kindness to George, even though there was the possibility, in her own mind at least, that the bad thing that had happened to his wife might have been his own doing.</p><p>he was thinking of Emerson, the terrible aristocracy that is in Nature. Because there were things in this world you couldn&#x2019;t control. And because even now he was thinking of her. Even now, with his wife lying dead in that house.</p><p>He could hear Joe Pratt on the phone.</p><p>George waited on the green couch, shaking a little. Their house smelled like dogs and he could hear them barking out back in their pens. He wondered how they could stand it. He stared at the wide boards, a funk of mildew coming up from the cellar. He could feel it in the back of his throat. He coughed.</p><p>They&#x2019;re on their way, Pratt said from the kitchen.</p><p>George nodded.</p><p>Down the hall, June Pratt was talking to his daughter with the sweet tone people use on children and he was grateful for it, so much so that his eyes teared a little. She was known for taking in strays. He&#x2019;d see her walking the road with the motley pack at her side, a middle--aged woman in a red kerchief, frowning at the ground.</p><p>After a while, he couldn&#x2019;t say how long, a car pulled up.</p><p>Here they are now, Pratt said.</p><p>It was Travis Lawton who came in. George, he said, but didn&#x2019;t shake his hand.</p><p>Hello, Travis.</p><p>Chosen was a small town and they were acquaintances of a sort. He knew Lawton had gone to RPI and had come back out here to be sheriff, and it always struck George that for an educated man he was pretty shallow. But then George wasn&#x2019;t the best judge of character and, as he was continually reminded by a coterie of concerned individuals, his opinion didn&#x2019;t amount to much. George and his wife were newcomers. The locals took at least a hundred years to accept the fact that somebody else was living in a house that had, for generations, belonged to a single family whose sob stories were now part of the local mythology. He didn&#x2019;t know these people and they certainly didn&#x2019;t know him, but in those few minutes, as he stood there in the Pratts&#x2019; living room in his wrinkled khakis and crooked tie, with a distant, watery look in his eyes that could easily be construed as madness, all their suspicions were confirmed.</p><p>Let&#x2019;s go take a look, Lawton said.</p><p>They left Franny with the Pratts and went up the road, him and Lawton and Lawton&#x2019;s undersheriff, Wiley Burke. It was dark now. They walked with grave purpose, a brutal chill under their feet.</p><p>The house sat there grinning.</p><p>They stood a minute looking up at it and then went in through the screened porch, a clutter of snowshoes and tennis rackets and wayward leaves, to the kitchen door. He showed Lawton the broken glass. They climbed the stairs in their dirty boots. The door to their bedroom was shut; he couldn&#x2019;t remember shutting it. He guessed that he had.</p><p>I can&#x2019;t go in there, he told the sheriff.</p><p>All right. Lawton touched his shoulder in a fatherly way. You stay right here.</p><p>Lawton and his partner pushed through the door. Faintly, he heard sirens. Their shrill cries made him weak.</p><p>He waited in the hall, trying not to move. Then Lawton came out, bracing himself against the doorjamb. He looked at George warily. That your ax?</p><p>George nodded.

The heart of the book explains the specifics of how to create seven basic marbling patterns and how to troubleshoot technical problems, plus ways to achieve seven specialty techniques, including marbling dimensional objects. The concluding section offers ideas for several projects incorporating marbling, as well as a brief explanation about going into business selling your marbled products.The fifteenth-century Persians called marbling "cloud art." Its ethereal nickname comes as no surprise, since marbling was used primarily for decorating the flyleaves of important books.

Where are all the men? Golfing? Playing softball? Watching the tube? Mowing the lawn? Sleeping? One place you won't find them is in church. Less than 40 percent of adults in most churches are men, and 20 to 25 percent of married churchgoing women attend without their husbands. And why are the men who do go to church so bored? Why won't they let God change their hearts? </p><p>David Murrow's groundbreaking new book reveals why men are the world's largest unreached people group. With eye-opening research and a persuasive grasp on the facts, Murrow explains the problem and offers hope and encouragement to women, pastors, and men. <em>Why Men Hate Going to Church</em> does not call men back to the church-it calls the church back to men.</p></p><p><p>David Murrow&nbsp;is an award-winning television producer and writer based in Alaska, most recently working for Sarah Palin. A best-selling author, he is also director of Church for Men, an organization that helps churches connect with men and boys. David and his wife, Gina, have three children.</p>Erik Synnestvedt clearly delivers the author&#39;s cutting-edge work about why men dislike going to church. He matches voice to mood when Murrow discusses his belief that most churches today are female dominated, although led by males. Murrow believes churches cater to women when they should instead &#34;embrace the masculine spirit.&#34; Synnestvedt perfectly renders the author&#39;s mandate: Mentor men; encourage them to make male friends, assume leadership roles, and show strength. Synnestvedt vividly describes why the author calls church today &#34;velvet coffin Christianity.&#34; He recounts what Murrow calls &#34;churches&#39; spiritual thermostats&#34;: confrontation, challenge, comfort, conformity, control, and ceremony. Jesus authorized only the first three. Murrow does not call men back to church, but &#34;calls church back to men.&#34; G.D.W. � AudioFile 2010, Portland, Maine</p><h2>You: A Novel</h2><p><b>NOW A HIT NETFLIX SERIES</b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;Hypnotic and scary.&#x201d; &#x2014;Stephen King</b><br> <br> <b>&#x201c;I am RIVETED, AGHAST, AROUSED, you name it.

I want to be here, fully, watching you bite your unpainted nails and turn your head to the left, no, bite that pinky, widen those eyes, to the right, no, reject biographies, self-help (thank God), and slow down when you make it to fiction.<br> <br>Yes.<br> <br>I let you disappear into the stacks&#x2014;Fiction F&#x2013;K&#x2014;and you&#x2019;re not the standard insecure nymph hunting for Faulkner you&#x2019;ll never finish, never start; Faulkner that will harden and calcify, if books could calcify, on your nightstand; Faulkner meant only to convince one-night stands that you mean it when you swear you never do this kind of thing. No, you&#x2019;re not like those girls. You don&#x2019;t stage Faulkner and your jeans hang loose and you&#x2019;re too sun-kissed for Stephen King and too untrendy for Heidi Julavits and who, who will you buy? You sneeze, loudly, and I imagine how loud you are when you climax. &#x201c;God bless you!&#x201d; I call out.<br> <br>You giggle and holler back, you horny girl, &#x201c;You too, buddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Buddy. You&#x2019;re flirting and if I was the kind of asshole who Instagrams, I would photograph the F&#x2013;K placard and filter the shit out of that baby and caption it:<br> <br>F&#x2014;K yes, I found her.<br> <br>Calm down, Joe. They don&#x2019;t like it when a guy comes on too strong, I remind myself. Thank God for a customer and it&#x2019;s hard to scan his predictable Salinger&#x2014;then again, it&#x2019;s always hard to do that. This guy is, what, thirty-six and he&#x2019;s only now reading Franny and Zooey? And let&#x2019;s get real. He&#x2019;s not reading it. It&#x2019;s just a front for the Dan Browns in the bottom of his basket. Work in a bookstore and learn that most people in this world feel guilty about being who they are. I bag the Dan Brown first like it&#x2019;s kiddie porn and tell him Franny and Zooey is the shit and he nods and you&#x2019;re still in F&#x2013;K because I can see your beige sweater through the stacks, barely. If you reach any higher, I&#x2019;ll see your belly. But you won&#x2019;t. You grab a book and sit down in the aisle and maybe you&#x2019;ll stay here all night. Maybe it&#x2019;ll be like the Natalie Portman movie Where the Heart Is, adapted faithlessly from the Billie Letts book&#x2014;above par for that kind of crud&#x2014;and I&#x2019;ll find you in the middle of the night. Only you won&#x2019;t be pregnant and I won&#x2019;t be the meek man in the movie. I&#x2019;ll lean over and say, &#x201c;Excuse me, miss, but we&#x2019;re closed&#x201d; and you&#x2019;ll look up and smile. &#x201c;Well, I&#x2019;m not closed.&#x201d; A breath. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m wide open. Buddy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey.&#x201d; Salinger-Brown bites. He&#x2019;s still here? He&#x2019;s still here. &#x201c;Can I get a receipt?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry about that.&#x201d;<br> <br>He grabs it out of my hand. He doesn&#x2019;t hate me. He hates himself. If people could handle their self-loathing, customer service would be smoother.<br> <br>&#x201c;You know what, kid? You need to get over yourself. You work in a bookstore. You don&#x2019;t make the books. You don&#x2019;t write the books and if you were any good at reading the books, you probably wouldn&#x2019;t work in a bookstore. So wipe that judgmental look off your face and tell me to have a nice day.&#x201d;<br> <br>This man could say anything in the world to me and he&#x2019;d still be the one shame-buying Dan Brown. You appear now with your intimate Portman smile, having heard the motherfucker. I look at you. You look at him and he&#x2019;s still looking at me, waiting.<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a nice day, sir,&#x201d; I say and he knows I don&#x2019;t mean it, hates that he craves platitudes from a stranger. When he&#x2019;s gone, I call out again because you&#x2019;re listening, &#x201c;You enjoy that Dan Brown, motherfucker!&#x201d;<br> <br>You walk over, laughing, and thank God it&#x2019;s morning, and we&#x2019;re dead in the morning and nobody is gonna get in our way. You put your basket of books down on the counter and you sass, &#x201c;You gonna judge me too?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What an asshole, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Eh, probably just in a mood.&#x201d;<br> <br>You&#x2019;re a sweetheart. You see the best in people. You complement me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; I say and I should shut up and I want to shut up but you make me want to talk. &#x201c;That guy is the reason that Blockbuster shouldn&#x2019;t have gone under.&#x201d;<br> <br>You look at me. You&#x2019;re curious and I want to know about you but I can&#x2019;t ask so I just keep talking.<br> <br>&#x201c;Everybody is always striving to be better, lose five pounds, read five books, go to a museum, buy a classical record and listen to it and like it. What they really want to do is eat doughnuts, read magazines, buy pop albums. And books? Fuck books. Get a Kindle. You know why Kindles are so successful?&#x201d;<br> <br>You laugh and you shake your head and you&#x2019;re listening to me at the point when most people drift, go into their phone. And you&#x2019;re pretty and you ask, &#x201c;Why?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell you why. The Internet put porn in your home&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>I just said porn, what a dummy, but you&#x2019;re still listening, what a doll.<br> <br>&#x201c;And you didn&#x2019;t have to go out and get it. You didn&#x2019;t have to make eye contact with the guy at the store who now knows you like watching girls get spanked. Eye contact is what keeps us civilized.&#x201d;<br> <br>Your eyes are almonds and I go on. &#x201c;Revealed.&#x201d;<br> <br>You don&#x2019;t wear a wedding ring and I go on. &#x201c;Human.&#x201d;<br> <br>You are patient and I need to shut up but I can&#x2019;t. &#x201c;And the Kindle, the Kindle takes all the integrity out of reading, which is exactly what the Internet did to porn. The checks and balances are gone. You can read your Dan Brown in public and in private all at once. It&#x2019;s the end of civilization. But&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s always a but,&#x201d; you say and I bet you come from a big family of healthy, loving people who hug a lot and sing songs around a campfire.<br> <br>&#x201c;But with no places to buy movies or albums, it&#x2019;s come down to books. There are no more video stores so there are no more nerds who work in video stores and quote Tarantino and fight about Dario Argento and hate on people who rent Meg Ryan movies. That act, the interaction between seller and buyer, is the most important two-way street we got. And you can&#x2019;t just eradicate two-way streets like that and not expect a fallout, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>I don&#x2019;t know if you know but you don&#x2019;t tell me to stop talking the way people sometimes do and you nod. &#x201c;Hmm.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;See, the record store was the great equalizer. It gave the nerds power&#x2014;&#x2018;You&#x2019;re really buying Taylor Swift?&#x2019;&#x2014;even though all those nerds went home and jerked it to Taylor Swift.&#x201d;<br> <br>Stop saying Taylor Swift. Are you laughing at me or with me?<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; I say, and I&#x2019;ll stop if you tell me to.<br> <br>&#x201c;Anyway,&#x201d; you say, and you want me to finish.<br> <br>&#x201c;The point is, buying stuff is one of the only honest things we do. That guy didn&#x2019;t come in here for Dan Brown or Salinger. That guy came in here to confess.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you a priest?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No. I&#x2019;m a church.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Amen.&#x201d;<br> <br>You look at your basket and I sound like a deranged loner and I look in your basket. Your phone. You don&#x2019;t see it, but I do. It&#x2019;s cracked. It&#x2019;s in a yellow case. This means that you only take care of yourself when you&#x2019;re beyond redemption. I bet you take zinc the third day of a cold. I pick up your phone and try to make a joke.<br> <br>&#x201c;You steal this off that guy?&#x201d;<br> <br>You take your phone and you redden. &#x201c;Me and this phone . . .&#x201d; you say. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m a bad mommy.&#x201d;<br> <br>Mommy. You&#x2019;re dirty, you are.<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah.&#x201d;<br> <br>You smile and you&#x2019;re definitely not wearing a bra. You take the books out of the basket and put the basket on the floor and look at me like it wouldn&#x2019;t be remotely possible for me to criticize anything you ever did. Your nipples pop. You don&#x2019;t cover them. You notice the Twizzlers I keep by the register. You point, hungry. &#x201c;Can I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I say, and I am feeding you already. I pick up your first book, Impossible Vacation by Spalding Gray. &#x201c;Interesting,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Most people get his monologues. This is a great book, but it&#x2019;s not a book that people go around buying, particularly young women who don&#x2019;t appear to be contemplating suicide, given the fate of the author.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, sometimes you just want to go where it&#x2019;s dark, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Yeah.&#x201d;<br> <br>If we were teenagers, I could kiss you. But I&#x2019;m on a platform behind a counter wearing a name tag and we&#x2019;re too old to be young. Night moves don&#x2019;t work in the morning, and the light pours in through the windows. Aren&#x2019;t bookstores supposed to be dark?<br> <br>Note to self: Tell Mr. Mooney to get blinds. Curtains. Anything.<br> <br>I pick up your second book, Desperate Characters by one of my favorite authors, Paula Fox. This is a good sign, but you could be buying it because you read on some stupid blog that she&#x2019;s Courtney Love&#x2019;s biological grandmother. I can&#x2019;t be sure that you&#x2019;re buying Paula Fox because you came to her the right way, from a Jonathan Franzen essay.<br> <br>You reach into your wallet. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s the best, right? Kills me that she&#x2019;s not more famous, even with Franzen gushing about her, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>Thank God. I smile. &#x201c;The Western Coast.&#x201d;<br> <br>You look away. &#x201c;I haven&#x2019;t gone there yet.&#x201d; I look at you and you put your hands up, surrender. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t shoot.&#x201d; You giggle and I wish your nipples were still hard. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m gonna read The Western Coast someday and Desperate Characters I&#x2019;ve read a zillion times. This one&#x2019;s for a friend.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Uh-huh,&#x201d; I say and the red lights flash danger. For a friend.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s probably a waste of time. He won&#x2019;t even read it. But at least she sells a book, right?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;True.&#x201d; Maybe he&#x2019;s your brother or your dad or a gay neighbor, but I know he&#x2019;s a friend and I stab at the calculator.<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s thirty-one fifty-one.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Holy money. See, that&#x2019;s why Kindles rule,&#x201d; you say as you reach into your Zuckerman&#x2019;s pig-pink wallet and hand me your credit card even though you have enough cash in there to cover it. You want me to know your name and I&#x2019;m no nut job and I swipe your card and the quiet between us is getting louder and why didn&#x2019;t I put on music today and I can&#x2019;t think of anything to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Here we go.&#x201d; And I offer you the receipt.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; you murmur. &#x201c;This is a great shop.&#x201d;<br> <br>You&#x2019;re signing and you are Guinevere Beck. Your name is a poem and your parents are assholes, probably, like most parents. Guinevere. Come on.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thank you, Guinevere.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I really just go by Beck. Guinevere&#x2019;s kinda long and ridiculous, you know?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Well, Beck, you look different in person. Also, Midnite Vultures is awesome.&#x201d;<br> <br>You take your bag of books and you don&#x2019;t break eye contact because you want me to see you seeing me. &#x201c;Right on, Goldberg.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nah, I just go by Joe. Goldberg is kind of long and ridiculous, ya know?&#x201d;<br> <br>We&#x2019;re laughing and you wanted to know my name as much as I wanted to know yours or you wouldn&#x2019;t have read my name tag. &#x201c;Sure you don&#x2019;t wanna grab The Western Coast while you&#x2019;re here?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This will sound crazy, but I&#x2019;m saving it. For my nursing home list.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You mean bucket list.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh no, that&#x2019;s totally different. A nursing home list is a list of things you plan on reading and watching in a nursing home. A bucket list is more like . . . visit Nigeria, jump out of an airplane. A nursing home list is like, read The Western Coast and watch Pulp Fiction and listen to the latest Daft Punk album.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t picture you in a nursing home.&#x201d;<br> <br>You blush. You are Charlotte&#x2019;s Web and I could love you. &#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t you gonna tell me to have a nice day?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have a nice day, Beck.&#x201d;<br> <br>You smile. &#x201c;Thanks, Joe.&#x201d;<br> <br>You didn&#x2019;t walk in here for books, Beck. You didn&#x2019;t have to say my name. You didn&#x2019;t have to smile or listen or take me in. But you did. Your signature is on the receipt. This wasn&#x2019;t a cash transaction and it wasn&#x2019;t a coded debit. This was real. I press my thumb into the wet ink on your receipt and the ink of Guinevere Beck stains my skin.</p><h2>Wanderground</h2><p>In a world where girls can no longer wear pants, only skirts and hose; women's Sunday softball is discontinued; shorter rest periods on the job exist so that women can't socialize; and a ten o'clock curfew is created for increasing the protection for women - an exodus begins. This monumental move separates men and women, such that many women flee to the hills for freedom, while men remain in the cities.<br>Leading us through the women's shared stories of survival, remembrance, and self-discovery, Wanderground brings us years later to a future, present with spiritual awakening. Here, the hill women have gained telepathic abilities, unique flying and healing techniques, and go on tour duty to assist women in the cities still struggling for enlightenment.</p><p><i>The Wanderground</i> is a feminist classic that deserves a fresh reading. In these linked stories, Sally Gearhart portrays a futuristic lesbian utopia where women can communicate telepathically with each other, as well as with plants and animals. The women in the community of Wanderground raise children collectively, choose to die when they think it is time, and heal physical wounds by inducing their own bloodletting. While at first glance this book may appear to be a naive science fiction-romance, the ideas in it are quite prescient. Many of the terms in <i>The Wanderground</i>--<i>learntogether</i>, <i>listenspread</i>--are compound words coined by Gearhart to suggest forms of communication that seemed impossible in the late 1970s, but that have become common in the age of the Internet. Gearhart's text foresaw that a world in which lesbians can live safely and independently is also a world in which communication does not require the physical presence of the body.Sally Miller Gearhart grew up in Virginia and found her first love at a women's college. After inhabiting a dark closet for twenty years, she burst onto the political scene of the San Francisco Bay Area in 1970. San Francisco State University hired her as an open lesbian and tenured her in 1974. She taught there for two decades, helping to found the school's radical Women's Studies Program and publishing three books. Scores of her articles and stories have been anthologized in feminist publications. <p>Sally is well know for her leadership (along with Supervisor Harvey Milk) in defeating the 1978 Briggs Initiative in California, which was designed to bar homosexuality and homosexuals from schools. This decisive victory helped turn the tide for lesbian and gay civil rights across the country. In 1984, Sally appeared in the The Times of Harvey Milk, the Academy Award-winning documentary that chronicled that political era. She has also been an activist for animal rights and Earth First!, and now lives on a mountain of contradictions with many cats and a blue-tick coon hound in a Mendocino County women's community.</p></p><h2>Jung and Feminism: Liberating Archetypes</h2><p>Brings the insights of feminist theory to bear on the seemingly unbridgeable gap between analytical psychology and feminism, and reveals Jungian psychology as the ultimately liberating vision its founder intended it to be.</p><p></p><h2>What Darkness Brings: A Sebastian St. Cyr Mystery</h2><p><b>The death of a notorious London diamond merchant draws aristocratic investigator Sebastian St. Cyr and his new wife Hero into a sordid world of greed, desperation, and the occult, when the husband of Sebastian&#x2019;s former lover Kat Boleyn is accused of the murder</b>.<p></p><p><i>Regency England, September 1812:</i>&nbsp;After a long night spent dealing with the tragic death of a former military comrade, a heart-sick Sebastian learns of a new calamity: Russell Yates, the dashing, one-time privateer who married Kat a year ago, has been found standing over the corpse of Benjamin Eisler, a wealthy gem dealer. Yates insists he is innocent, but he will surely hang unless Sebastian can unmask the real killer.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of Kat, the woman he once loved and lost, Sebastian plunges into a treacherous circle of intrigue. Although Eisler&#x2019;s clients included the Prince Regent and the Emperor Napoleon, he was a despicable man with many enemies and a number of dangerous, well-kept secrets&#x2014;including a passion for arcane texts and black magic.&nbsp;Central to the case is a magnificent blue diamond, believed to have once formed part of the French crown jewels, which disappeared on the night of Eisler&#x2019;s death.&nbsp;As Sebastian traces the diamond&#x2019;s ownership, he uncovers links that implicate an eccentric, powerful financier named Hope and stretch back into the darkest days of the French Revolution.</p><p></p><p>When the killer grows ever more desperate and vicious, Sebastian finds his new marriage to Hero tested by the shadows of his first love, especially when he begins to suspect that Kat is keeping secrets of her own. And as matters rise to a crisis, Sebastian must face a bitter truth--that he has been less than open with the fearless woman who is now his wife.</p></p><p><b>C. S. Harris</b> graduated Phi Beta Kappa, summa cum laude, with a degree in classics before earning a PhD in European history. A respected scholar of the French Revolution and nineteenth-century Europe, she is also the author of the nonfiction study <i>Women, Equality, and the French Revolution</i>, written under the name Candice E. Proctor.&nbsp;After years of living in England and various far-flung regions of the old British Empire, she now makes her home in New Orleans with her husband, retired Army Intelligence officer Steve Harris, with whom she has written contemporary thrillers under the name C. S. Graham.Eighth in Harris&#x2019; Sebastian St. Cyr series, this volume is perhaps the best yet, with its air of Regency intrigue and its abashed, somewhat bewildered hero. The story begins with newly married Sebastian, still grieving after the death of a friend, caught up in the murder of a wicked gem dealer whose demise is blamed on St. Cyr&#x2019;s acquaintance Russell Yates, now languishing in prison. Found bloodied and standing over the corpse, Yates needs Sebastian&#x2019;s sleuthing expertise, though it&#x2019;s Yates&#x2019; wife, Kat Boleyn, St. Cyr&#x2019;s former lover, who begs for help. It&#x2019;s a delicious, complicated tangle made even tastier by Sebastian&#x2019;s bride, the wise Hero, and by Harris&#x2019; tender treatment of the newlyweds&#x2019; affection and growing love for one another. Harris&#x2019; acute characterizations and her facility for portraying the complexities of human emotion are similar to Imogen Robertson&#x2019;s in Anatomy of Murder(2012), while her view of social niceties hiding dark motives conjures Anne Perry. --Jen Baker</p><h2>With Christ in the School of Prayer: Thoughts on Our Training for the Ministry of Intercession (Hendrickson Christian Classics)</h2><p>This is one of the most beloved books on prayer, written by a man whose entire life was devoted to prayer. <br>With Christ in the School of Prayer presents a thirty-one day tutorial: each chapter presents a new aspect of prayer, in a concise way that is at the same time rich and joyful, coming from the author's vital relationship with God.

We do not have final answers to the deep problems of life, and those who say they do are probably living in some degree of delusion. There are areas of mystery in our Christian faith that lie beyond the keenest scholarship or even the most profound spiritual exercises. For many people, these problems raise so many questions and uncertainties that faith itself becomes a struggle, and the very person and character of God are called into question. Chris Wright encourages us to face up to the limitations of our understanding and to acknowledge the pain and grief they can often cause. But at the same time, he wants us to be able to say, like the psalmist in Psalm 73: &#x201c;But that&#x2019;s all right. God is ultimately in charge and I can trust him to put things right. Meanwhile, I will stay near to my God, make him my refuge, and go on telling of his deeds.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Dr. Christopher J. H. Wright is International Director of the Langham Partnership International. After teaching the Old Testament in India and the UK, he also served as chair of the Lausanne Movement&#x2019;s Theology Working Group and was the chief architect of the Cape Town Commitment at the Third Lausanne Congress, 2010.&nbsp;His books include: <em>Knowing Jesus through the Old Testament, Old Testament Ethics for the People of God,&nbsp;Deuteronomy (</em>Understanding the Bible Commentary<em>), Salvation Belongs to Our God, The Mission of God, The God I Don't Understand, </em>and<em>&nbsp;The Mission of God's People. </em>Chris and his wife Liz who have four adult children and a growing number of grandchildren, live in London, Uk, and belong to All Souls Church.</p>'Christopher J. H. Wright boldly explores the four most difficult subjects Christians will generally face: the problem of evil, the genocide of Joshua, how modern culture can make sense of the cross, and prophecies about the end of the world. In each case, Wright uses his long experience as a theologian/teacher to skillfully and winsomely bring us through the dead-end solutions we often hear and lead us in fruitful and promising directions. This is not a book filled with the usual piety or apologetic drivel so often found in such treatments: it is a tough-minded and courageous wrestling match with profound issues of faith reminiscent of John Stott. Few of us would take on such a task. Wright has not only done it well--- but supremely well.' -- Gary M.

She is the author of two collections of stories and Pushkin"s Children: Writing on Russia and Russians. Her work has appeared in the New York Review of Books, The New Yorker, the New Republic, and other periodicals. Tolstaya has taught at Princeton University and, for many years, Skidmore College.1<br>� <br>AZ<br>Benedikt pulled on his felt boots, stomped his feet to get the fit right, <br>checked the damper on the stove, brushed the bread crumbs onto the <br>floor&#x2014;for the mice&#x2014;wedged a rag in the window to keep out the cold, <br>stepped out the door, and breathed the pure, frosty air in through his nostrils. <br>Ah, what a day! The night"s storm had passed, the snow gleamed all white <br>and fancy, the sky was turning blue, and the high elfir trees stood still. Black <br>rabbits flitted from treetop to treetop. Benedikt stood squinting, his reddish <br>beard tilted upward, watching the rabbits. If only he could down a couple&#x2014;for <br>a new cap. But he didn"t have a stone.<br> It would be nice to have the meat, too. Mice, mice, and more <br>mice&#x2014;he was fed up with them.<br> Give black rabbit meat a good soaking, bring it to boil seven <br>times, set it in the sun for a week or two, then steam it in the oven&#x2014;and it <br>won"t kill you.<br> That is, if you catch a female. Because the male, boiled or not, it <br>doesn"t matter. People didn"t used to know this, they were hungry and ate <br>the males too. But now they know: if you eat the males you"ll be stuck with <br>a wheezing and a gurgling in your chest the rest of your life. Your legs will <br>wither. Thick black hairs will grow like crazy out of your ears and you"ll <br>stink to high heaven.<br> Benedikt sighed: time for work. He wrapped his coat around him, <br>set a wood beam across the door of the izba, and even shoved a stick <br>behind it. There wasn"t anything to steal, but he was used to doing things <br>that way. Mother, may she rest in peace, always did it that way. In the <br>Oldener Days, before the Blast, she told him, everyone locked their doors. <br>The neighbors learned this from Mother and it caught on. Now the whole <br>settlement locked their doors with sticks. It might be Freethinking.<br> His hometown, Fyodor-Kuzmichsk, spread out over seven hills. <br>Benedikt walked along listening to the squeak of fresh snow, enjoying the <br>February sun, admiring the familiar streets. Here and there black izbas <br>stood in rows behind high pike fences and wood gates; stone pots or wood <br>jugs were set to dry on the pikes. The taller terems had bigger jugs, and <br>some people would even stick a whole barrel up there on the spike, right in <br>your face as if to say: Look how rich I am, Golubchiks! People like that don"t <br>trudge to work on their own two feet, they ride on sleighs, flashing their <br>whips, and they"ve got a Degenerator hitched up. The poor thing runs, all <br>pale, in a lather, its tongue hanging out, its felt boots thudding. It races to <br>the Work Izba and stops stock-still on all four legs, but its fuzzy sides keep <br>going huffa, puffa, huffa, puffa.<br> And it rolls its eyes, rolls "em up and down and sideways. And <br>bares its teeth. And looks around . . .<br> To hell with them, those Degenerators, better to keep your <br>distance. They"re strange ones, and you can"t figure out if they"re people or <br>not. Their faces look human, but their bodies are all furry and they run on all <br>fours. With a felt boot on each leg. It"s said they lived before the Blast, <br>Degenerators. Could be.<br> It"s nippy out now, steam comes out of his mouth, and his beard"s <br>frozen up. Still&#x2014;what bliss! The izbas are sturdy and black, there are high <br>white snowdrifts leaning against the fences, and a little path has been <br>beaten to each gate. The hills run smooth all the way up and back down, <br>white, wavy; sleighs slide along the snowy slopes, and beyond the sleighs <br>are blue shadows, and the snow crunches in colors, and beyond the hills the <br>sun rises, splashing rainbows on the dark blue sky. When you squint, the <br>rays of the sun turn into circles; when you stomp your boots in the fluffy <br>snow it sparks, like when ripe firelings flicker.<br> Benedikt thought a moment about firelings, remembered his <br>mother, and sighed: she passed away on account of those firelings, poor <br>thing. They turned out to be fake.<br> The town of Fyodor-Kuzmichsk spreads out over seven hills. <br>Around the town are boundless fields, unknown lands. To the north are <br>deep forests, full of storm-felled trees, the limbs so twisted you can"t get <br>through, prickly bushes catch at your britches, branches pull your cap off <br>your head. Old people say the Slynx lives in those forests. The Slynx sits on <br>dark branches and howls a wild, sad howl&#x2014;eeeeennxx, eeeeennxx, eeenx-<br>aleeeeeennnxx &#x2014;but no one ever sees it. If you wander into the forest it <br>jumps on your neck from behind: hop! It grabs your spine in its teeth&#x2014;<br>crunch&#x2014;and picks out the big vein with its claw and breaks it. All the <br>reason runs right out of you. If you come back, you"re never the same again, <br>your eyes are different, and you don"t ever know where you"re headed, like <br>when people walk in their sleep under the moon, their arms outstretched, <br>their fingers fluttering: they"re asleep, but they"re standing on their own two <br>feet. People will find you and take you inside, and sometimes, for fun, they"ll <br>set an empty plate in front of you, stick a spoon in your hand, and say "Eat." <br>And you sit there like you"re eating from an empty plate, you scrape and <br>scrape and put the spoon in your mouth and chew, and then you make to <br>wipe your dish with a piece of bread, but there"s no bread in your hand. Your <br>kinfolk are rolling on the floor with laughter. You can"t do for yourself, not even <br>take a leak, someone has to show you each time. If your missus or mother <br>feels sorry for you, she takes you to the outhouse, but if there"s no one to <br>watch after you, you"re a goner, your bladder will burst, and you"ll just die.<br> That"s what the Slynx does.<br> You can"t go west either. There"s a sort of road that way&#x2014;<br>invisible, like a little path. You walk and walk, then the town is hidden from <br>your eyes, a sweet breeze blows from the fields, everything"s fine and good, <br>and then all of a sudden, they say, you just stop. And you stand there. And <br>you think: Where was I going anyway? What do I need there? What"s there <br>to see? It"s not like it"s better out there. And you feel so sorry for yourself. <br>You think: Maybe the missus is crying back at the izba, searching the <br>horizon, holding her hand over her eyes; the chickens are running around <br>the yard, they miss you too; the izba stove is hot, the mice are having a field <br>day, the bed is soft . . . And it"s like a worrum got at your heart, and he"s <br>gnawing a hole in it . . . You turn back. Sometimes you run. And as soon <br>as you can see your own pots on your fence, tears burst from your eyes. It"s <br>really true, they splash a whole mile. No lie!<br> You can"t go south. The Chechens live there. First it"s all steppe, <br>steppe, and more steppe&#x2014;your eyes could fall out from staring. Then <br>beyond the steppe&#x2014;the Chechens. In the middle of the town there"s a <br>watchtower with four windows, and guards keep watch out of all of them. <br>They"re on the lookout for Chechens. They don"t really look all the time, of <br>course, as much as they smoke swamp rusht and play straws. One person <br>grabs four straws in his fist&#x2014;three long ones, one short. Whoever picks the <br>short one gets a whack on the forehead. But sometimes they look out the <br>window. If they spot a Chechen, they"re supposed to cry "Chechens, <br>Chechens!" and then people from all the settlements run out and start beating <br>pots with sticks, to scare the Chechens. And the Chechens skedaddle. <br>Once, two people approached the town from the south, an old man and an <br>old woman. We banged on our pots, stomped and hollered up a storm, but <br>the Chechens didn"t care, they just kept on coming and looking around. We&#x2014;<br>well, the boldest of us&#x2014;went out to meet them with tongs, spindles, whatever <br>there was. To see who they were and why they came.<br> "We"re from the south, Golubchiks," they said. "We"ve been <br>walking for two weeks, we"ve walked our feet off. We came to trade rawhide <br>strips. Maybe you have some goods?"<br> What goods could we have? We eat mice. "Mice Are Our <br>Mainstay," that"s what Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe, teaches. But our people <br>are softhearted, they gathered what there was in the izbas and traded for <br>the rawhide and let them go their way. Later there was a lot of talk about <br>them. Everyone jabbered about what they were like, the stories they told, <br>how come they showed up.<br> Well, they looked just like us: the old man was gray-headed and <br>wore reed shoes, the old woman wore a scarf, her eyes were blue, and she <br>had horns. Their stories were long and sad. Benedikt was little and didn"t <br>have any sense at all then, but he was all ears.<br> They said that in the south there"s an azure sea, and in that sea <br>there"s an island, and on that island there"s a tower, and in that tower <br>there"s a golden stove bed. On that bed there"s a girl with long hair&#x2014;one hair <br>is gold, the next is silver, one is gold, and the next is silver. She lies there <br>braiding her tresses, just braiding her long tresses, and as soon as she <br>finishes the world will come to an end.<br> Our people listened and listened and said: "What"s gold and <br>silver?"<br> And the Chechens said: "Gold is like fire, and silver is like <br>moonlight, or when firelings light up."<br> Our people said: "Ah, so that"s it. Go on and tell us some more."<br> And the Chechens said: "There"s a great river, three years" walk <br>from here. In that river there"s a fish&#x2014;Blue Fin. It talks with a human voice, <br>cries and laughs, and swims back and forth across that river. When it <br>swims to one side and laughs, the dawn starts playing, the sun rises up in <br>the sky, and the day comes. When it goes back, it cries, drags the darkness <br>with it, and hauls the moon by its tail. All the stars in the sky are Blue Fin"s <br>scales."<br> We asked: "Have you heard why winter comes and why summer <br>goes?"<br> The old lady said: "No, good people, we haven"t heard, I won"t lie, <br>we haven"t heard. It"s true, though, folks wonder: Why do we need winter, <br>when summer is so much sweeter? It must be for our sins."<br> But the old man shook his head. "No," he said, "everything in <br>nature must have its reason. A feller passing through once told me how it <br>is. In the north there"s a tree that grows right up to the clouds. Its trunk is <br>black and gnarled, but its flowers are white, teeny tiny like a speck of dust. <br>Father Frost lives in that tree, he"s old and his beard is so long he tucks it <br>into his belt. Now, when it comes time for winter, as soon as the chickens <br>flock together and fly south, then that Old Man Frost gets busy: he starts <br>jumping from branch to branch, clapping his hands and muttering doodle-dee-<br>doo, doodle-dee-doo! And then he whistles: wheeeeooossshhhh! Then the <br>wind comes up, and those white flowers come raining down on us&#x2014;and <br>that"s when you get snow. And you ask: Why does winter come?"<br> Our Golubchiks said: "Yes, that"s right. That must be the way it <br>is. And you, Grandpa, aren"t you afraid to walk the roads? What"s it like at <br>night? Have you come across any goblins?"<br> "Oh, I met one once!" said the Chechen. "Seen him up close, I <br>did, close as you are to me. Now hear what I say. My old woman had a <br>hankering for some firelings. Bring me some firelings, she kept saying. And <br>that year the firelings ripened sweet, nice and chewy. So off I go. Alone."<br> "What do you mean, alone!" we gasped.<br> "That"s right, alone," boasted the stranger. "Well, listen up. I was <br>walking along, just walking, and it started getting dark. Not very dark, but, <br>well, all gray-like. I was tiptoeing so as not to scare the firelings when <br>suddenly: shush-shush-shush! "What"s that?" I thought. I looked&#x2014;no one <br>there. I went on. Again: shush-shush-shush. Like someone was shushing <br>the leaves. I looked around. No one. I took another step. And there he was <br>right in front of me. There was nothing there "tall, and then all of a sudden I <br>seen him. At arm"s length. Just a little feller. Maybe up to my waist or chest. <br>Looked like he were made of old hay, his eyes shone red and he had palms <br>on his feet. And he was stomping those palms on the ground and chanting: <br>pitter-patter, pitterpatter, pitter-patter. Did I run, let me tell you! Don"t know <br>how I ended up at home. My old lady didn"t get her firelings that time."<br> The children asked him: "Grandfather, tell us what other monsters <br>there are in the forest."<br> They poured the old man some egg kvas and he started. "I was <br>young back then, hotheaded. Not afraid of a thing. Once I tied three logs <br>together with reeds, set them on the water&#x2014;our river is fast and wide&#x2014;sat <br>myself down on them, and off I floated. The honest truth! The women ran <br>down to the bank, there was a hollering and a wailing, like you might <br>expect. Where do you see people floating on the river? Nowadays, I"m told, <br>they hollow out trunks and put them on the water. If they"re not lying, of <br>course."<br> "No, they"re not, they"re not! It"s our Fyodor Kuzmich, Glorybe. He <br>invented it!" we cried out, Benedikt loudest of all.<br> "Don"t know any Fyodor Kuzmich myself. We aren"t booklearned. <br>That"s not my story. Like I said, I wasn"t afraid of nothing. Not mermaids or <br>water bubbles or wrigglers that live under stones. I even caught a <br>whirlytooth fish in a bucket."<br> "Come on, Grandpa," our folks said. "Now you"re making things <br>up."<br> "That"s the honest truth! My missus here will tell you."<br> "It"s true," the old lady said. "It happened. How I yelled at him. He <br>clean ruined my bucket, I had to burn it. Had to carve out a new one, and a <br>new one, by the time you hollow it, tar it, let it dry three times, cure it with <br>rusht, rub it with blue sand&#x2014;it near to broke my hands, I worked so hard. <br>And for him, it"s all glory. The whole village came out to look at him. Some <br>were afraid."<br> "Of course they were," we said.<br> The old man was pleased. "But then, you see, maybe I"m the only <br>one," he boasted. "The only one seen a whirlytooth up close&#x2014;close as you <br>folks there, he was&#x2014;and come out of it alive. Ha! I was a real he-man. <br>Mighty! Sometimes I"d yell so loud the window bladders would burst. And <br>how much rusht I could drink at a sitting! I could suck a whole barrel dry."<br> Benedikt"s mother was sitting there, her lips pressed. "What <br>concrete benefit did you derive from your strength? Did you accomplish <br>anything socially beneficial to the community?" she asked.<br> The old man was offended. "When I was a youngster, <br>Golubushka, I could jump from here to that hill way over there on one leg! <br>Beneficial! I tell you, sometimes I"d give a shout&#x2014;and the straw would fall <br>off the roof. All our folks is like that. A real strong man, I was. My missus <br>here will tell you, if I get a blister or a boil&#x2014;it"s as big as your fist. No joke. I <br>had pimples that big, I tell you. That big. And you talk. I"ll have you know <br>when my old man scratched his head, he"d shake off a half-bucket of <br>dandruff."<br> "Come on, now," we piped up. "Grandpa, you promised to tell us <br>about monsters."<br> But the old man wasn"t joking, he was really mad. "I"m not saying <br>another word. If you come to listen . . . then listen. Don"t go butting in. It <br>ruins the whole story. She must be one of them Oldeners, I can tell by the <br>way she talks."<br> "That"s right," said our people, throwing a side glance at <br>Mother. "One of the Oldeners.

He was born in New York City, into a Jewish family that had immigrated from Russia, and received an A.B. from Columbia University. He was first a radio scriptwriter, and worked with Fred Allen, then in 1941 worked for the US government on radio spots selling war bonds. Wouk then joined the United States Navy and served in the Pacific Theater, an experience he later characterized as educational; &#34;I learned about machinery, I learned how men behaved under pressure, and I learned about Americans.&#34; His first ship was the USS Zane, then he was second-in-command on the Southard. He started his writing career onboard, working on a novel during his off-duty hours. He married Betty Sarah Brown in 1945, with whom he had three sons, became a fulltime writer in 1946, and published his debut novel, Aurora Dawn in 1947. In 1952, The Caine Mutiny received the Pulitzer Prize. In 1998, he received the Guardian of Zion Award.This novel of truly epic proportion deals with the conflict and drama of an evolving post-WWII Israel. Theodore Bikel is an ideal choice for this narrative interpretation. Dealing with numerous characters, he never misses a beat, shifting easily from one accent to another. In one scene, this listener could well imagine sitting in on an impromptu conference held in David Ben-Gurion&#39;s bedroom. While military personnel make somber predictions, Mrs. Ben-Gurion frets over the health of Israel&#39;s founding father. Production and vocal quality are superb; however, this is a ponderous work, and the minds of all but Wouk&#39;s most devoted readers may wander while listening. D.R.T.

Williams says it will require four (big) books to tell his complex, multithreaded tale, and at the rate that the plot of this second novel moves, readers will see what he means. Not that the book is a slow read; in fact, <i>River</i> is as much a suspenseful page-turner as the first book. <p> As <i>River</i> opens, we join up again with the ragtag bunch of searchers trapped in an astoundingly detailed and frightfully dangerous virtual world known as Otherland. Lurking in disguise among the group is the brutally vicious serial killer Dread, trying to find information that will help him overthrow his Grail Brotherhood masters. The group follows a ubiquitous river through world after world, unable to go offline, and subject to the increasingly terrifying certainty that things in this supposedly virtual place are all too real. Meanwhile, Paul Jonas, an amnesic (but somehow pivotal) character fleeing from two sinister beings, finds more and more of his memory as he does his own Huck Finn river trip. As in the first novel, each new world that the characters enter, from Paleolithic Ice Age to something suspiciously like Oz, is fully realized and completely unpredictable. </p><p> Williams is a master at parceling out information to the reader in dribs and drabs, which is frustrating yet tantalizing, like a particularly good computer game. When the group is split up and the adventure divides further, the reader senses the author as a puppet master, following some incredibly complex flows of information. The best course is just to hang on and enjoy Williams's deft characterizations, lush descriptions, and wildly divergent plot. If you've ever been white-water rafting, you'll recognize the feeling. <i>--Therese Littleton</i></p><b>Tad Williams</b> has held more jobs than any sane person should admit to&#x2014;singing in a band, selling shoes, managing a financial institution, throwing newspapers, and designing military manuals, to name just a few. He also hosted a syndicated radio show for ten years, worked in theater and television production, taught both grade-school and college classes, and worked in multimedia for a major computer firm.

Reprint.</p><p>Anne McCaffrey was one of the world&#39;s leading science fiction writers, and won both the Hugo and Nebula awards. She was brought up in the US and lived in Ireland for many years. She co-authored books with Elizabeth Moon, Jody Lynn Nye, Margaret Ball, Mercedes Lackey and S.M. Stirling. She died in November 2011 at the age of 85.This space adventure further develops McCaffrey's vivid future universe of diversified cultures, technological wonders and twisted, sometimes corrupt, politics. Space Station SSS-900C, a profitable but out-of-the-way trading and mining center, is attacked by Kolnari, pirates from a planet of sociopathic exiles. While awaiting the arrival of the Central Worlds' Navy, the inhabitants play for time with a major deception planned by Simeon, the shellperson operating the station, whose hobby is the study of early warfare, including guerrilla tactics. (Shellpeople, damaged while young by accident or birth defect and encased in life-support systems, are wired into and control sophisticated technology such as space stations, cities and spaceships, while maintaining their own personalities and emotions.) Central to the scheme is obedience to all the Kolnari's demands while keeping secret the fact of Simeon's existence, since if the Kolnari gained control of the technically sophisticated shellperson they would have an intolerable advantage. As Simeon clandestinely builds his trap for the Kolnari, he wistfully watches and encourages a love affair between Channa Hap, the woman he loves and cannot have, and a noble refugee. McCaffrey (The Dragonriders of Pern series, The Ship Who Sang ) and Stirling (the Draka series) create vivid heroes and villains in a complex and deadly game. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The World Turned Upside Down: Radical Ideas During the English Revolution</h2><p>Radical Ideas During the English Revolution</p><p><b>Christopher Hill</b> is the former Modern History Fellow and Tutor and Master of Balliol College, Oxford.

Corporate bullying at a top TV network saw her fired and forced to leave London, but she was determined to get her life back. A new job and a few therapists later, things look much brighter. Especially when a challenging new project presents itself &#x2015; to catalogue the late M. H. Mason's wildly eccentric cache of antique dolls and puppets. Rarest of all, she'll get to examine his elaborate displays of posed, costumed and preserved animals, depicting bloody scenes from the Great War.

Catherine tries to concentrate on the job, but Mason's damaged visions begin to raise dark shadows from her own past. Shadows she'd hoped therapy had finally erased.

But everything improves when a Tian jouster requisitions Vetch to become the first serf ever to be a dragon boy. His training is intense, and his duty clear-cut: to tend his jouster, Ari, and his dragon, Kashet. He discovers that, because Ari himself had hatched Kashet, the dragon is different from others that have been captured live in the wild and must be drugged to be made tractable. Vetch finds he really likes and understands dragons, and soon he becomes the best dragon boy of all. He still harbors anger, however, toward the Tian invasion. Could he, perhaps, hatch a dragon, and then escape to help his people? In Vetch's world, Lackey gives us a wonderfully visualized society, similar in terrain, climate, religion, and the differing circumstances of slave, serf, and free person to ancient Egypt. Moreover, she fills the book with well-limned characterizations and convincing, detailed dragon lore to make up a whole in which Vetch's coming-of-age becomes an integral part. Fans of McCaffrey's Pern will love it, but they won't be the only ones who do. <i>Sally Estes</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Yes, I&#x2019;ve had the great good fortune to be born into a life of wealth and privilege, with a name to match. Yes, I&#x2019;ve had every opportunity, every advantage. And yes, I&#x2019;ve chosen to build my career on a foundation built by my father and grandfather, so I can certainly see why an outsider might dismiss my success in our family business as yet another example of nepotism. </p><p>But my parents set the bar high for me and my brothers. They gave us a lot, it&#x2019;s true, but they expected a lot in return. And you can be sure we didn&#x2019;t rise to our positions in the company by any kind of birthright or foregone conclusion. My father is definitely not the kind of guy who&#x2019;d place his children in key roles within his organization if he didn&#x2019;t think we could surpass the expectations he had for us. You see, in the Trump household, it was never just about meeting the expectations of others. It was about exceeding them. It was about surprising people. And being the best. Anything less was second-rate, which probably explains one of my biggest worries starting out&#x2014;that I would merely be competent at my job in the Trump Organization. Good enough, and nothing more. </p><p>I can still remember how anxious I felt, how completely out of my element, when I was appointed to the board of directors of Trump Entertainment Resorts, the parent corporation of our casino operations in Atlantic City. Realize, this was no closely held family business. It was a public company, so there was enormous pressure to prove that I belonged. Some of that pressure was real, and some of it was imagined&#x2014;but that didn&#x2019;t make it any less terrifying. I can still remember walking over to my first board meeting at the law offices of Weil, Gotshal &amp; Manges, feeling incredibly nervous the whole way. It was just a five-minute walk, but that was more than enough time to think through every worst-case scenario. It didn&#x2019;t help that just before I left my office someone pointed out that I was about to become the youngest director on the board of a publicly traded company in the United States; I had enough to worry about already. I was twenty-five years old, just a year or so into my tenure at Trump, about to sit around a conference table with a group of middle-aged men&#x2014;some of whom, I&#x2019;m sure, would be wondering what the hell I was doing there. On some level I knew that I&#x2019;d been tapped to represent the voice of a younger generation and to represent my family&#x2019;s interests in the company that bore our brand. But on another, I worried that I&#x2019;d be exposed as a kid in over her head. My formal appointment was still subject to board approval, and I still had to apply for a gaming license and gain other clearances, but I vowed on that uneasy walk that I would never give these people a reason to question the value I brought to the table. </p><p>The whole way over to that meeting, it felt to me as if my appointment to the board was stacked all the way against me: I was young and inexperienced; I was a woman; and I was Donald Trump&#x2019;s daughter. (It might appear as if this last would be a plus, but I didn&#x2019;t see it counting for a whole lot in my favor; if anything, it might have given the impression that I had been tapped only for some vague public relations value.) Growing up with two brothers, I&#x2019;d watched enough baseball to know that you get only three strikes, so I might have counted myself out before I even stepped to the plate. But then I realized that what some people might regard as a negative, others might see as a strength. Maybe my relative youth and inexperience would help me offer a fresh take. Maybe the board needed a young woman&#x2019;s perspective. Maybe the fact that I was Donald Trump&#x2019;s eyes and ears on the board, as I was at the Trump Organization and on his reality television show, would make me uniquely qualified to offer insights and strategies for positioning the three Trump-branded casinos that were the primary assets of the company. </p><p>In any case, it was overwhelming. Intimidating. So how did I handle it? I dug in, breathed deep, and vowed to do whatever it took to show my new colleagues on the board and the company&#x2019;s management team that I added real value. And merely belonging wouldn&#x2019;t quite cut it, in my estimation. I was determined to play an integral role. I might be nervous, but I wouldn&#x2019;t show it. I might be intimidated, but I wouldn&#x2019;t show it. I might even be a bit overmatched, in my first few meetings, but I&#x2019;d get up to speed before long. And sure enough, that&#x2019;s just what happened. By the end of that first meeting, most of my anxieties fell away, and I walked back to my office in Trump Tower feeling as if I had made a contribution, after all. As if I would make an even greater contribution going forward. </p><p>Let&#x2019;s face it, when you come from a place where <i>good enough</i> is not quite good enough, you&#x2019;re bound to push yourself. You&#x2019;re disinclined to take anything for granted. And you&#x2019;re not about to be dismissed just because someone might think you&#x2019;ve had an unfair advantage. These days, I try not to let it bother me when someone jumps to conclusions about my abilities. I have a tough skin and enough confidence not to worry too much about being underestimated because of my last name, my relative youth, or my modeling background. It comes with the territory. I&#x2019;ve reached the point where I know I&#x2019;m no lightweight. I&#x2019;m perfectly capable of separating my colleagues and associates from this type of snap judgment when it comes up&#x2014;which happens less and less these days, I&#x2019;m happy to report. </p><p>The message I put out to people who are prepared to write me off before even meeting with me: get over it. It&#x2019;s the same message I used to give to myself whenever I spent too much time worrying what people would think of me or how I&#x2019;d risen to my position in the company or what attributes I brought to the table. I&#x2019;d catch myself agonizing along these lines and think, Just get over it, Ivanka. Or, It&#x2019;s not your problem, it&#x2019;s theirs. After all, I eventually realized, we&#x2019;ve all got our own baggage. Whatever we do, whatever our backgrounds, we&#x2019;ve all had some kind of advantage somewhere along the way. Some break that might have gone to someone else. Some edge or inside track we couldn&#x2019;t have counted on. </p><p><b></b></p><b><b>CONSIDER THE STAGGER</b></b> <p>As long as I&#x2019;m on that inside track, I might as well work that metaphor a bit more to make my point. That perceived lead I might have had starting out? It&#x2019;s like the stagger you see in a middle-distance event at a track meet. You know, where the runners line up in a stepping-stone way in their separate lanes, the runner in the outside lane well ahead of the field before the starting gun goes off, the runner in the inside lane well behind. It&#x2019;s set up that way so that each runner covers the same ground before she reaches the first straightaway, but it has the appearance of being an advantage. In truth, the only advantage is psychological; each runner ends up covering the same ground by the end of the race. With me, it probably looked as if I were in the outside lane, way ahead of the rest of the pack before the race even started. But I still had to run the distance. I still had to go to school, learn the basics, develop my own style, make and support my own decisions, and on and on. </p><p>What a lot of people don&#x2019;t realize is that this all-too-common mis-perception usually runs hand in hand with another. It took me a while to recognize this, but there&#x2019;s definitely a flip side to how other people might see you, way out there in life&#x2019;s outer lane with that apparent jump start. On the one hand, you get the idea that my success is purely a by-product of privilege, proximity, or favoritism&#x2014;or, relatedly, that Donald Trump&#x2019;s daughter could not possibly have ascended to the role of vice president of his real estate company for any reason but filial devotion. People assume that I&#x2019;m not smart enough or driven enough or savvy enough to have made it on my own. On the other, it&#x2019;s just the opposite. People build it up in their heads that just because I&#x2019;m Donald Trump&#x2019;s daughter, it must mean I have an inherent understanding of all things related to real estate and finance. </p><p>(I guess it could be worse!) </p><p>I used to get this a lot when I was at Wharton, as an undergraduate at the University of Pennsylvania, where my classmates would turn to me whenever a professor posted a challenging question. In their minds, because I&#x2019;d spent so much time with my father and shared the same genes and mind-set, I must know the answer automatically. And truth be told, I still get this kind of deferential treatment. People sometimes approach me tentatively or suspiciously because of my father&#x2019;s reputation as a world-class negotiator, as if they think I&#x2019;m about to take advantage of them. As if I know something I&#x2019;m not letting on. It can be a big disadvantage, especially going into a negotiation, when I&#x2019;d much rather be <i>underestimated.</i> My brothers tell me that the same thing happens to them all the time, so we just deal with it and move on. </p><p>I get it from both sides, the good and the bad. Positive and negative. And I&#x2019;ve learned to ignore it. To rise above it. I refuse to let the opinions of others define how I see myself, how I carry myself, how I get through my days. It&#x2019;s just not relevant to me. If I got upset every time someone suggested that I was coasting on my last name, my looks, or ...</p></p><h2>Shadowrise: 3 (Shadowmarch)</h2><p>Shadowrise: Vol 3 Of Shadowmarch, by Williams, Tad</p><p><b>Tad Williams&nbsp;</b>is a California-based fantasy superstar.&nbsp; His genre-creating (and genre-busting) books have sold tens of millions worldwide.&nbsp; His considerable output of epic fantasy and epic science fiction series, fantastical stories of all kinds, urban fantasy novels, comics, scripts, etc., have strongly influenced a generation of writers.&nbsp; Tad always has several secret projects on the go. 2016 will see the debut of a number of them; March 2017 brings&nbsp;<i>The Witchwood Crown</i>, the first volume in the long-awaited return to the world of the Memory, Sorrow &amp; Thorn novels. Tad and his family live in the Santa Cruz mountains in a suitably strange and beautiful house.The third novel in Williams&#x2019; Shadowmarch series sees his characters in great trouble. The crippled Prince Barrick has fallen over the Shadowline, where he is eventually befriended by an ancient Qar&#x2019; (i.e., fairy) king, though for the king&#x2019;s own purposes. Princess Briony has landed in a foreign court with only her wits to protect her. Southmarch Castle, home of the prince and the princess, is besieged by the Qar&#x2019;, and their father has been captured by the mad Autarch of Xis, who wants to use King Olin to release an ancient power. And all that is just at the book&#x2019;s outset. Williams builds strongly on the plots of Shadowmarch (2004) and Shadowplay (2007), which he summarizes here because knowing them is absolutely necessary to enjoying this book. A fourth volume, Shadowheart, is due at the end of 2010. --Frieda Murray</p><h2>A Daughter&#39;s Tale: The Memoir of Winston Churchill&#39;s Youngest Child</h2><p>In this charming and intimate memoir, Winston Churchill&#x2019;s youngest daughter shares stories from her remarkable life&#x2014;and tells of the unbreakable bond she forged with her father through some of the most tumultuous years in British history. <br> &nbsp;<br> Now approaching her ninetieth birthday, Mary Soames is the only surviving child of Winston and Clementine Churchill. Through a combination of personal reminiscences and never-before-published diary entries, she describes what it was like growing up as the scion of one of the lions of twentieth-century statecraft. Warm memories of a childhood spent roaming the grounds of the family&#x2019;s country estate, tending to a small menagerie of pets, evoke the idyllic mood of England between the wars. As she matures into one of her father&#x2019;s most trusted companions, we are given rare glimpses inside the glittering social milieu through which the Churchills moved&#x2014;as well as the rough-and-tumble world of British politics. With fly-on-the-wall immediacy, Mary describes the momentous debate in Parliament where Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain was driven from office, paving the way for Winston Churchill&#x2019;s ascension and the grueling crucible of World War II.<br> &nbsp;<br> During the war Mary served as a gunner in the women&#x2019;s auxiliary, helping to shoot down the German V-1 rockets then bedeviling London. Styling herself as Private M. Churchill to avoid publicity, she led a unique double life that comes vividly alive again in the retelling. Splitting her time between luncheons at Chequers&#x2014;where she spent time with the likes of Lord Mountbatten&#x2014;and the turret of an anti-aircraft battery, she was never far from the center of the action. Hitler even reportedly hatched a plan, never consummated, to hire spies to seduce her in order to gain access to secret British war plans. She attended the Potsdam Conference as her father&#x2019;s aide-de-camp, arranging a memorable dinner with Harry Truman and Josef Stalin (whom she acidly remembers as &#x201c;small, dapper, and rather twinkly&#x201d;). And when British voters overwhelmingly turned on Churchill in the 1945 election, it is left to Mary to recount the pain and devastation her father could never publicly express. <br> &nbsp;<br> The mutual love and affection between Mary Soames and her parents pours forth from every page of this elegantly written memoir. <i>A Daughter&#x2019;s Tale</i> is both a moving personal history and a source of untold insight into one of the enduring icons of British national life.</p><p><b>Mary Soames</b> is the youngest and only surviving child of Winston and Clementine Churchill. She was born in 1922 and brought up at Chartwell in Kent. In 1941, at age eighteen, she joined the Auxiliary Territorial Service and served in mixed anti-aircraft batteries in England and Europe. She accompanied her father as his aide-de-camp on several of his wartime overseas journeys. In 1945 she was awarded the MBE (military). In 1947 she married Captain Christopher Soames, Coldstream Guards, later Lord Soames, PC, GCMG, CH. She is also the author of her mother's biography, <i>Clementine Churchill</i>, and edited <i>Speaking for Themselves,</i> the personal letters between her parents.chapter 1<br><br>Chartwell Child<br><br>September 1922 saw another event of even greater importance to the Churchills&#x2019; family life than the birth of the &#x201c;Benjamin&#x201d;&#x2014;myself. In the very week I was born, Winston made an offer for Chartwell Manor, near Westerham in Kent. Three years earlier, Winston and Clementine had sold a charming old house and property, Lullenden, near East Grinstead in Sussex, which they had bought in the latter part of the First World War, chiefly to get their (and Winston&#x2019;s brother Jack&#x2019;s) children out of London and away from the zeppelin raids. It had been a real haven for everybody, but the small farm proved a real money loser, and in 1919 they had most regretfully sold it. Since then the whole family had greatly missed their country life. Long school holidays were spent in rented houses, but these were no substitute for one&#x2019;s own home, and Winston and Clementine were soon on the lookout for another &#x201c;country basket&#x201d; (as Clementine called it). One major problem stood between them and their dream house: money&#x2014;or rather, the lack of it. However, in January 1921 a totally unforeseen event dramatically changed their financial situation: the death, already noted, of Lord Herbert Vane-Tempest. He was childless, and through the tortuous processes of entail his considerable fortune, in the form of the Garron Towers estate in Ireland, passed to Winston. Now the remote hope of a &#x201c;country basket&#x201d; became a bright possibility, and Winston and Clementine kept their eyes and ears open.<br><br>Presently Winston saw Chartwell. About twenty-five miles from London, it was a dilapidated and unprepossessing Victorian house built round a much older core, standing on a hilltop commanding the most sensational view to the south over the Weald of Kent. Below the house the hillside falls away to a lake, fed by a spring&#x2014;the Chartwell&#x2014;and alongside the whole valley ran a wide belt of beech woods sheltering the property from the north and east. Winston fell&#x2014;at once and forever&#x2014;in love with this beautiful place. He, of course, hastened to show it to Clementine, whose first reaction was enthusiastic&#x2014;&#x201c;I can think of nothing but that heavenly tree-crowned Hill,&#x201d; she had written to him in July 1921. But on subsequent visits she became aware of several major defects in its condition, and soon realized that the cost of making the house habitable would be significantly higher than the original estimates. Furthermore&#x2014;perhaps most serious of all the drawbacks&#x2014;she feared the house and property would be too much for them to run and maintain. Time would prove her right in both these judgements. However, to all her arguments Winston was deaf&#x2014;although for a time he went &#x201c;quiet&#x201d; on the plan to buy this place which had so beguiled him. Then, during the second half of September, while Clementine was fully occupied with their new baby, Winston presented her with a fait accompli&#x2014;his offer for Chartwell had been accepted. Clementine, contrary to Winston&#x2019;s earnest hope, never came to share his love of Chartwell&#x2014;and never quite forgave him for his (totally untypical) lack of candour with her at the time of its purchase.<br><br>The autumn of 1922 was an eventful one both for the Churchills domestically and for the country politically. While Winston lay very ill from an emergency appendectomy in October, the famous and fateful meeting of the Conservative party at the Carlton Club put an end to the Coalition: Lloyd George and his government resigned, and were succeeded by Bonar Law and a Conservative administration. Parliament was dissolved, and at the ensuing general election in November the Conservatives won a large majority over the Liberals, the latter fatally divided between the followers of Lloyd George (Winston among them) and of Asquith.<br><br>Winston&#x2019;s seat in Dundee, which he had represented for fourteen years, was gallantly fought by Clementine and a band of devoted supporters until Winston, still in a very weak condition after his operation, arrived late in the campaign. It was here that I made my first entry into politics, at the age of seven weeks, when in the local newspaper a photograph of my mother arriving by train from London for the campaign bore the unhelpful (and, in the circumstances, churlish) caption: &#x201c;Mrs Churchill and her unbaptized infant [my italics] arrive in Dundee.&#x201d; A further ill omen was their local address in Dudhope Terrace. Winston was roundly defeated, thereby evoking his rueful comment that he found himself &#x201c;without an office, without a seat, without a party and without an appendix.&#x201d;<br><br>After all these events and calamities, Winston (liberated from the ties of government and Parliament) and Clementine took themselves and their brood off to five sunshine months in Cannes, where they rented the Villa R�ve d&#x2019;Or. Winston recovered his health, painted, and pondered his future; Clementine loved the warmth and played a lot of tennis; and I (after my first singularly unsuccessful foray into politics) lay cocooned in my pram.<br><br>i was nearly two years old when our family moved into a rehabilitated and largely rebuilt Chartwell, after all the usual hazards and hindrances, compromises, and final ill will between architect and clients which seem inevitably to accompany such enterprises.<br><br>Winston, with the three &#x201c;Big Ones,&#x201d; Diana, Randolph, and Sarah, formed the pioneer party, moving in with a basic survival kit and minimal staff support in the Easter holidays: Winston wrote his first letter to Clementine from Chartwell on 17 April 1924. But it would be nearly another two months before she, Nana Whyte (who will figure very prominently in my story), &#x201c;Baby Bud&#x201d; (me), and the rest of the household took up residence. The first weekend guests signed the visitors&#x2019; book in the last weekend of June.<br><br>My first memory is snapshot-clear, and must be from that summer. I am lying in my big pram under the great yew tree on the lawn in front of the arcaded windows of the new dining room. Woken up from my midmorning siesta, I am greatly bored: I start jiggling (I am really too big now for the pram), and (securely held by my harness) manage to rock my &#x201c;boat.&#x201d; Now I try a back-and-forth movement: this is great fun&#x2014;except suddenly the pram pitches forward on to its handle, and I slide down, held awkwardly suspended by my straps. Suddenly grown-ups, clutching white table napkins, are running towards me&#x2014;a luncheon party was in progress, and my plight had been observed: I am rescued, taken into the dining room, consoled, and made much of. I think dining-room life is very agreeable, and plan to join it as soon as may be!<br><br>At this point I must introduce Nana. After the trauma of Marigold&#x2019;s death, and the departure of Mlle. Rose, Clementine was much shaken in her confidence, and, fully aware that her life with Winston would always mean frequent absences from her children, cast about to find a more mature nanny/nursery governess figure to take charge of them. As chance would have it, she did not have far to look: her own first cousin, Maryott Whyte, was a trained Norland nurse&#x2014;then, as now, the ne plus ultra in terms of child care. Maryott, known as &#x201c;Moppet,&#x201d; was the younger daughter of Lady Maude Whyte, a daughter of the Earl and Countess of Airlie and so Clementine&#x2019;s aunt. Lady Maude Ogilvy had made a late, and&#x2014;since she had next to no money herself&#x2014;improvident marriage to Theodore Whyte, himself an impoverished gentleman land agent. The Whytes had four children&#x2014;Madeline, Mark (who would be killed aged nineteen in Flanders in 1918), Maryott, and Felix. The two girls were well educated, but, unlike their female cousins (or indeed the majority of their female social contemporaries), knew that they must earn their living. Madeline was an intellectual artisan, learning carpentry and working at the famous Doves Press. Here, under the tutelage of Cobden Sanderson, she became an expert in bookbinding, a craft she subsequently taught herself for many years. Moppet was sensible and intelligent, but less eccentric than her elder sister: she elected to train as a children&#x2019;s nurse and, at the time her cousin Clementine Churchill was looking round for someone to take charge of her lively nursery/schoolroom, was aged twenty-six and in one of her early posts after completing her Norland training.<br><br>So cousin Moppet, or Nana&#x2014;as she was to all of us children&#x2014;was recruited, and came to our family in October 1921. Randolph was then in his second year at Sandroyd, a preparatory school in Surrey, and the two girls were day pupils at Notting Hill High School. After my arrival on the scene nearly a year later, Nana&#x2019;s attention was largely focused on myself: she was enchanted to be in charge of a baby again, and with Randolph and Diana rapidly outgrowing the confines of the nursery, her dominion principally embraced Sarah and the &#x201c;Baby Bud.&#x201d; Nana, while observing her professional position in the household, was nevertheless from the start on a different footing from all the previous nannies, as Clementine&#x2019;s first cousin and the social equal of her employers: when I was christened, she was my godmother.<br><br>I cannot think of any reason for my being named Mary. My only godfather, Victor Cazalet, considerably annoyed my mother by suggesting I should be called &#x201c;Victoria,&#x201d; and went so far as to have that name engraved on the elegant pale blue velvet case which enclosed his present to me (the almost statutory christening gift at that time: an &#x201c;add-a-pearl&#x201d; necklace&#x2014;to which the recipient&#x2019;s benefactors were meant to do just that at regular intervals). I only discovered this font-side disagreement years later when, on examining the velvet case, I made out that Mary had been very firmly superimposed on an only partially successful erasure of Victoria. I was rather sorry; I felt I would have liked to be Victoria (Vicky to personal friends, of course). But plain old Mary had clearly been under discussion for some time before my christening at the end of November, because in a letter from school on 1 October Randolph wrote: &#x201c;What is the baby going to be christened? I do hope it will be Mary.?.?.?.&#x201d;<br><br>A &#x201c;Benjamin&#x2019;s&#x201d; life is one of contrasts, especially when there is a wide age gap between oneself and older siblings, as in my case: Sarah was nearly eight years old, Randolph eleven, and Diana thirteen when I appeared on the family scene. One finds oneself alternately in the roles of new cuddly toy and real little bore&#x2014;to be discarded rapidly when a more pressing or suitable-to-age attraction presents itself. Soon after our family&#x2019;s arrival at Chartwell, our father caused to be constructed in the first fork of the great lime in the front drive a wonderful tree house&#x2014;from which, of course, I was excluded. Access to this aerial retreat was by means of a rope ladder, which would be swiftly pulled up to preserve the privacy of the members of this elite club. The older children and their visiting cousins would spend hours aloft, and I remember at age four or five wandering disconsolately round the tree, gazing up, trying to catch the loudly whispered secrets and yearning to know the cause for the gales of uproarious laughter, quite often punctuated by stern commands down to me to &#x201c;Go and find Nana.&#x201d; I remember I very often took refuge in the office, whose windows looked out on the drive, where I found delightful (and apparently appreciative) company in the secretaries, who indulgently allowed me to play with the typewriters and pinch treasury tags and paper clips: I think they must have sometimes wished for the protection of a rope ladder too! Presently Nana would appear and bear me off to my quarters.<br><br>The nursery wing had been purposely built as part of the major construction work in the rehabilitation of Chartwell. Comprising three floors and an attic, it faced due south, overlooking the gardens and the beautiful Weald. On the ground floor, a long room combined both schoolroom and nursery life: there was a large open log fireplace (where we made buttered toast), and glazed doors opened out on to the garden. Behind this big front room were a bathroom, and a kitchen/pantry which produced elevenses, teas (delicious drop scones made on the stovetop), and our various pets&#x2019; meals; luncheon and Nana&#x2019;s supper were brought from the main kitchen by the nurserymaid.<br><br>The upper floors were connected by a very steep, narrow staircase, with blue linoleum-covered treads &#x201c;nosed&#x201d; with thick rubber. At first I scrambled laboriously down and up this precipice, but was soon negotiating it at high speed, taking two and three steps at a time: I had some horrific tumbles.<br><br>On the first floor Sarah had her room&#x2014;a lovely bed-sitter (evolving over the years from schoolgirl&#x2019;s den to debutante&#x2019;s &#x201c;bower&#x201d;) which also communicated via a door onto the Pink Terrace with Mama&#x2019;s Blue Sitting Room. Diana and Randolph from the first had their bedrooms in the main part of the house. On the second floor was the night nursery, with its adjoining bathroom: this was Nana&#x2019;s and my abode until I was about ten, when I was promoted to the attic and my first bed-sitter.<br><br>Only vestigial traces of the nursery staircase remain now, as sometime in the midthirties, when I was in my teens and had melded into grown-up domestic life, Nana and I migrated to the top floor of the main house. Then my father pierced through the thick wall and took possession of the former night nursery for his bedroom. Later still, after the war, my mother colonized her former sitting room as a bedroom, penetrating into Sarah&#x2019;s former room on the same level to create a dressing room and bathroom. I explain all this in some detail, because today thousands of visitors troop through the house, some of whom may read this book and be puzzled by the present configuration of the rooms and the disappearance of the nursery wing which figured so strongly in my childhood life.<br><br>If the nursery wing was my &#x201c;castle&#x201d; (of which undoubtedly I was the &#x201c;princess&#x201d;), it was also the base from which I sallied forth into the wider world. To a small child it was mountainous territory, as Chartwell, being constructed on the side of a steep hill, is a house of confusingly many levels. Unlike most nursery quarters one reads of, mine were based on the garden floor, and I started my daily forays on the same level as the servants&#x2019; hall, pantry, and kitchen. After calling on my numerous friends in those regions, I would then start on my uphill scramble to the upper floors&#x2014;probably first visiting my mother, who, adorned with curlers and hairnet, face liberally greased, would usually be ensconced in bed, penned in by her breakfast tray or hidden behind The Times. I always remember a warm welcome, though at this point it took the physical form of a wave rather than a cuddle. Here I would remain while a succession of &#x201c;callers&#x201d; made their appearance: her lady&#x2019;s maid; a secretary with a message; or Papa, arriving suddenly and unceremoniously, clad in his (extremely mini) silk vest/nightshirt, clutching his copy of The Times, and usually protesting at some part of the leading article. This he would discuss with Mummie (who had usually already noticed the offending passage) before departing again, like a tempestuous gust of wind, for his own study-bedroom along the passage. I always, if visible, received en passant a warm hug or embrace during this visitation. A more ceremonious interlude was the daily conference with the cook, who, in spotless white overall and apron, bearing the menu book, would draw up a chair and seat herself at the bedside. During the long&#x2014;and to me infinitely boring&#x2014;dialogue which ensued, I would disappear from view under the desk (I was a lion in my den); or I would clamber onto the lower shelf of the great oak double-doored cupboard, retreating and burrowing into folds of satin underclothes&#x2014;I remember how deliciously the silky gloom smelled. Needless to say, successive lady&#x2019;s maids gr...</p><h2>Now You See Them, Now You Don&#39;t (On the Run, Book 3)</h2><p>The thrills intensify in the next installment of Gordon Korman's adventure ON THE RUN.<br><br>One man holds the key to freeing Aidan and Meg Falconer's parents from prison: a mysterious figure named Frank Lindenauer.

Since then, the two have gone on to publish numerous faery books and contribute their ideas to such fantasy films as The Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, Legend and the new Lord of the Rings. This expanded version, like its predecessor, features pencil drawings and watercolors of mythical creatures, as well as brief descriptions of their origins and powers; it draws on a long history of phantasmagoric iconography in the generally occidental vein. It boasts new art and introductions by the artists, as well; in its silver anniversary, the bewitching quality of its content remains. Besides faeries, the authors also include renderings of many other denizens of faery land-goblins, dwarves and leprechauns, for instance-as well as stranger breeds, such as the Fachan, a one-armed, one-legged oddity from the Scotland highlands and the Jack-in-Irons, a "Yorkshire giant who haunts lonely roads." For the child learning the pleasures of magical worlds, or for adults who never forgot, this book remains a delight. 176 color and 38 b&amp;w illustrations. <br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>I, Strahd: The Memoirs of a Vampire (Ravenloft: the Covenant)</h2><p>A re-release of a haunting vampire tale from best-selling author P.N.

Banks pulled the car onto the shoulder and flipped on the spotlight, running the beam along the edge of the field where corn stalks shivered in the cold. Twenty yards away, six Jersey cows stood in the bar ditch, chewing their cud.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows," he muttered. Besides chickens, they had to be the dumbest animals on earth.</p><p>He hit the radio. "Dispatch, this is forty-seven."</p><p>"What's up, T.J.?" asked Mona, the night dispatcher.</p><p>"I got a 10-54. Stutz's damn cows are out again."</p><p>"That's the second time in a week."</p><p>"Always on my shift, too."</p><p>"So what are you going to do? He ain't got no phone out there."</p><p>A glance at the clock on the dash told him it was nearly two A.M. "Well, I'm not going to stand out here in the frickin' cold and round up these stupid shits."</p><p>"Maybe you ought to just shoot 'em."</p><p>"Don't tempt me." Looking around, he sighed. Livestock on the road at this hour was an accident waiting to happen. If someone came around the curve too fast it could be bad. He thought of all the paperwork an accident would entail and shook his head. "I'll set up some flares then go drag his Amish ass out of bed."</p><p>"Let me know if you need backup." She snickered.</p><p>Yanking the zipper of his coat up to his chin, he slid his flashlight from its nest beside the seat and got out of the cruiser. It was so cold he could feel his nose hairs freezing. His boots crunched through snow as he made his way to the bar ditch, his breaths puffing out in front of him. He hated the graveyard shift almost as much as he hated winter.</p><p>He ran the flashlight beam along the fence line. Sure enough, twenty feet away two strands of barbed wire had come loose from a gnarled locust-wood post. Hoofprints told him several head had discovered the opening and ventured onto the shoulder for some illicit grazing.</p><p>"Stupid fuckin' cows."</p><p>T.J. went back to the cruiser and popped the trunk. Removing two flares, he set them up on the centerline to warn traffic. He was on his way back to the cruiser when he spotted something in the snow on the opposite side of the road. Curious, he crossed to it. A solitary woman's shoe lay on the shoulder. Judging from its condition and lack of snow cover, it hadn't been there long. Teenagers, probably. This deserted stretch of road was a favorite place to smoke dope and have sex. They were almost as stupid as cows.</p><p>Frowning, T.J. nudged the shoe with his foot. That was when he noticed the drag marks, as if something heavy had been hauled through the snow. He traced the path with the flashlight beam, tracking it to the fence and into the field beyond. The hairs at the back of his neck prickled when he spotted blood. A lot of it.</p><p>"What the hell?"</p><p>He followed the trail into the ditch where yellow grass poked up through the snow. He climbed the fence and found more blood on the other side, stark and black against pristine white. It was enough to give a guy the willies.</p><p>The path took him to a stand of bare-branched hedge apple trees at the edge of a cornfield. He could hear himself breathing hard, the dead corn stalks whispering all around. T.J. set his hand on his revolver and swept the beam in a 360-degree circle. That was when he noticed the object in the snow.</p><p>At first he thought an animal had been hit and dragged itself there to die. But as he neared, the beam revealed something else. Pale flesh. A shock of darkish hair. A bare foot sticking out of the snow. Adrenaline kicked hard in his gut. "Holy shit."</p><p>For an instant he couldn't move. He couldn't stop looking at the dark circle of blood and colorless flesh. Giving himself a hard mental shake, T.J. dropped to his knees beside the body. His first thought was that she might still be alive. Brushing at the snow, he set his hand against a bare shoulder. Her skin was ice cold, but he rolled her over anyway. He saw more blood and pasty flesh and glazed eyes that seemed to stare right at him.</p><p>Shaken, he scrambled back. His hand trembled as he grappled for his lapel mike. "Dispatch! This is forty-seven!"</p><p>"What now, T.J? One of them cows chase you up a tree?"</p><p>"I got a fuckin' body here at Stutz's place."</p><p><i>"What?"</i></p><p>They used the ten-code system in Painters Mill, but for the life of him he couldn't remember the number for a dead body. He'd never had to use it. "I said I got a dead body."</p><p>"I heard you the first time." But the words were followed by a stunned pause as realization hit her. "What's your twenty?"</p><p>"Dog Leg Road, just south of the covered bridge."</p><p>A beat of silence. "Who is it?"</p><p>Everyone knew everyone in Painters Mill, but he'd never seen this woman before. "I don't know. A woman. Naked as the day she came into this world and deader than Elvis."</p><p>"A wreck or what?"</p><p>"This was no accident." Setting his hand on the butt of his .38, T.J. scanned the shadows within the trees. He could feel his heart beating fast in his chest. "You'd better call the chief, Mona. I think we got us a murder."</p><p>SWORN TO SILENCE.

Growing up in the South, surrounded by racial bigotry and discrimination, Ali fought not just for a living, but also for respect and rewards far more precious than money or glory. He was named Sportsman of the Century by Sports Illustrated and the BBC. Ali redefined what it meant to be an athlete by giving hope to millions around the world and inspiring us all to fight for what is important to us. This is a multifaceted portrait of Muhammad Ali only he could render: sports legend; unapologetic anti-war advocate; outrageous showman and gracious goodwill ambassador; fighter, lover, poet, and provocateur; an irresistible force to be reckoned with. Who better to tell the tale than the man who went the distance living it?Muhammad Ali is the former three-time world heavyweight boxing champion. He and his wife, Lonnie, have established the Ali Center in Louisville, Kentucky, to preserve and share the legacy and ideals of Muhammad Ali. Hana Ali is a writer. She lives in Michigan, near her father and stepmother.</p><h2>Prodigal Summer</h2><p><p>It is summer in the Appalachian mountains and love, desire and attraction are in the air. Nature, too, it seems, is not immune. From her outpost in an isolated mountain cabin, Deanna Wolfe, a reclusive wildlife biologist, watches a den of coyotes that have recently migrated into the region. She is caught off guard by a young hunter who invades her most private spaces and interrupts her self-assured, solitary life. On a farm several miles down the mountain, Lusa Maluf Landowski, a bookish city girl turned farmer's wife, finds herself marooned in a strange place where she must declare or lose her attachment to the land that has become her own. And a few more miles down the road, a pair of elderly feuding neighbours tend their respective farms and wrangle about God, pesticides, and the possibilities of a future neither of them expected. Over the course of one humid summer, these characters find their connections of love to one another and to the surrounding nature with which they share a place. </p><p>With its strong balance of narrative and drama, <i>Prodigal Summer</i> is stands alongside <i>The Poisonwood Bible</i> and <i>The Lacuna</i> as one of Barbara Kingsolver's finest works.</p></p><p>There is no one in contemporary literature quite like Barbara Kingsolver. Her dialogue sparkles with sassy wit and earthy poetry; her descriptions are rooted in daily life but are also on familiar terms with the eternal. With <i>Prodigal Summer</i>, she returns from the Congo to a "wrinkle on the map that lies between farms and wildness." And there, in an isolated pocket of southern Appalachia, she recounts not one but three intricate stories. <p> Exuberant, lush, riotous--the summer of the novel is "the season of extravagant procreation" in which bullfrogs carelessly lay their jellied masses of eggs in the grass, "apparently confident that their tadpoles would be able to swim through the lawn like little sperms," and in which a woman may learn to "tell time with her skin." It is also the summer in which a family of coyotes moves into the mountains above Zebulon Valley: </p><blockquote> The ghost of a creature long extinct was coming in on silent footprints, returning to the place it had once held in the complex anatomy of this forest like a beating heart returned to its body. This is what she believed she would see, if she watched, at this magical juncture: a restoration. </blockquote> The "she" is Deanna Wolfe, a wildlife biologist observing the coyotes from her isolated aerie--isolated, that is, until the arrival of a young hunter who makes her even more aware of the truth that humans are only an infinitesimal portion in the ecological balance. This truth forms the axis around which the other two narratives revolve: the story of a city girl, entomologist, and new widow and her efforts to find a place for herself; and the story of Garnett Walker and Nannie Rawley, who seem bent on thrashing out the countless intimate lessons of biology as only an irascible traditional farmer and a devotee of organic agriculture can. As Nannie lectures Garnett, "Everything alive is connected to every other by fine, invisible threads. Things you don't see can help you plenty, and things you try to control will often rear back and bite you, and that's the moral of the story." <p> Structurally, that gossamer web <i>is</i> the story: images, phrases, and events link the narratives, and these echoes are rarely obvious, always serendipitous. Kingsolver is one of those authors for whom the terrifying elegance of nature is both aesthetic wonder and source of a fierce and abiding moral vision. She may have inherited Thoreau's mantle, but she piles up riches of her own making, blending her extravagant narrative gift with benevolent concise humor. She treads the line between the sentimental and the glorious like nobody else in American literature. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p><p>Barbara Kingsolver's fifth novel is a hymn to wildness that celebrates the prodigal spirit of human nature, and of nature itself. It weaves together three stories of human love within a larger tapestry of lives amid the mountains and farms of southern Appalachia. Over the course of one humid summer, this novel's intriguing protagonists face disparate predicaments but find connections to one another and to the flora and fauna with which they necessarily share a place.</p></p><h2>Devotional Life in the Wesleyan Tradition</h2><p>This workbook describes major features in John Wesley&#39;s devotional life, and it illustrates how you can apply his ministry to your own life.

They don't realize that some on the Alaskan island have more nefarious activities in mind, including drug smuggling.

Narrator Staci Snell provides a minimalist narration that manages to enhance the quiet story.

M.A.M. � AudioFile 2005, Portland, Maine-- <i>Copyright � AudioFile, Portland, Maine</i></p><h2>Singing in the Reign: The Psalms and the Liturgy of God&#39;s Kingdom</h2><p>Christians know the Psalms, sing the Psalms, and pray the Psalms more than any other book of the Bible. Yet, even as believers have grown more devoted to individual psalms, they have lost the big picture-the single sense that unites all the psalms as one coherent book. Michael Barber is at the forefront of an emerging movement in biblical theology. With this book, he is recovering the narrative plot that was the common heritage of Jews and Christians in the ancient world. Barber shows how King David serves as an example for the chosen people as they struggled in exile. As David was rescued by the Lord, so would Israel be restored as a kingdom for all ages. This is the story of Christ as well, whom Barber reveals as the &#34;new David.&#34; And, in Christ, it is the story of every Christian. The Psalms bring us-in our reading and in our prayer-from suffering and pleading to glory, triumph, and praise. Barber&#39;s analysis follows upon an extensive introduction by Scott Hahn, Ph.D., detailing the historical, cultural, and theological background of the Psalter.</p><p></p><h2>Macbeth (The Annotated Shakespeare)</h2><p><p>Perhaps no other Shakespearean drama so engulfs its readers in the ruinous journey of surrender to evil as does <i>Macbeth. </i>A timeless tragedy about the nature of ambition, conscience, and the human heart, the play holds a profound grip on the Western imagination.</p></p><p><p>Perhaps no other Shakespearean drama so engulfs us in the ruinous journey of surrender to evil as does <i>Macbeth.

In this work, Lindqvist uses Joseph Conrad's <i>Heart of Darkness</i> as a point of departure for a haunting tour through the colonial past, retracing the steps of Europeans in Africa from the late eighteenth century onward and thus exposing the roots of genocide via his own journey through the Saharan desert.<br> <br>The full text of <i>Terra Nullius</i> is also included, for which Lindqvist traveled 7,000 miles through Australia in search of the lands the British had claimed as their own because it was inhabited by "lower races," the native Aborigines nearly nine-tenths of whom were annihilated by whites. The shocking story of how "no man&#x2019;s land" became the province of the white man was called "the most original work on Australia and its treatment of Aboriginals I have ever read . . . marvelous" by Phillip Knightley, author of <i>Australia</i>.<br></p><p><p>Sven Lindqvist was the author of more than thirty books, including <em>&#x201c;Exterminate All the Brutes,&#x201d;</em> <em>The Skull Measurer&#x2019;s Mistake</em>, <em>A History of Bombing</em>, <em>Terra Nullius</em>, and <em>The Dead Do Not Die</em> (all published by The New Press).

Mathieu, is musical by nature&#x2014;it goes right along with being human. And if you don't believe it, this book will convince you. In a series of interrelated short essays, Mathieu takes the reader on a journey through ordinary experiences to open our ears to the rich variety of music that surrounds us but that we are trained to ignore; such as the variety of pitches produced by different objects, like glassware, furniture, drums&#x2014;anything you can tap; or sounds that hover on the border of music, like laughter, the clinking of glasses in a toast, or the unintentional falsetto produced by yawning. Along the way the author teaches aspects of music theory that nonmusicians might ordinarily shy away from. He reveals the way of music to be a profoundly spiritual path&#x2014;one that is everyone's birthright.</p><p>William Allaudin Mathieu is a composer pianist whose long and varied career ranges from his early work with the Stan Kenton band and The Second City Theater, to his extensive catalogue of song cycles, works for choir, and instrumental concert music. He has recorded extensively, and is the author of <i>The Listening Book</i>, <i>The Musical Life</i>, and <i>Harmonic Experience: Tonal Harmony from Its Natural Origin to Its Modern Expression</i>.Judging from his book, practicing Sufi Mathieu is a philosopher in the Thoreauvian cast. Also known by the name Allaudin, he has had a diverse career as composer, performer, and mystic, all of which is apparent in his treatment of music as a spiritual force with a technical side to it. Aiming to affirm his belief in the centrality of music to human nature, he addresses the nature of musical experience in a string of short, aphoristic essays on subjects ranging from aspects of music theory to observations on the types of falsetto produced by yawning. He writes beautifully, and the book has a calming, uplifting effect not unlike that of the better New Age music, and indeed, Mathieu has recorded several albums for the New Age label Windham Hill. Those seeking a verbal analogue to that kind of music will enjoy this book. <i>John Shreffler</i></p><h2>The Iron Tonic: Or, A Winter Afternoon in Lonely Valley</h2><p>It's difficult to say what <i>The Iron Tonic</i> is about, although it is "known the skating pond conceals a family of enormous eels," and that "the light is fading from the day. The rest is darkness and dismay." Finally, though, <i>The Iron Tonic</i> could be seen as Edward Gorey's version of a winter afternoon in one of the great Russian novels of the nineteenth century.<br></p><p>Edward Gorey (1925-2000) wrote and illustrated such popular books as The Doubtful Guest, The Gashlycrumb Tinies, and The Headless Bust. He was also a very successful set and costume designer, earning a Tony Award for his Broadway production of Edward Gorey&#39;s Dracula. Animated sequences of his work have introduced the PBS series Mystery! since 1980.A faded winter's afternoon on an estate in 19th-century Russia. You can almost see where this story will lead, but with Gorey as master of ceremonies, there will be a few twists. For one thing, the skating pond shelters a family of eels.

One April day, the impulse to write a novel came to him suddenly while watching a baseball game. That first novel, Hear the Wind Sing, won a new writers&#39; award and was published the following year. More followed, including A Wild Sheep Chase and Hard-Boiled Wonderland and the End of the World, but it was Norwegian Wood, published in 1987, which turned Murakami from a writer into a phenomenon. His books became bestsellers, were translated into many languages, including English, and the door was thrown wide open to Murakami&#39;s unique and addictive fictional universe. Murakami writes with admirable discipline, producing ten pages a day, after which he runs ten kilometres (he began long-distance running in 1982 and has participated in numerous marathons and races), works on translations, and then reads, listens to records and cooks. His passions colour his non-fiction output, from What I Talk About When I Talk About Running to Absolutely On Music, and they also seep into his novels and short stories, providing quotidian moments in his otherwise freewheeling flights of imaginative inquiry. In works such as The Wind-Up Bird Chronicle, 1Q84 and Men Without Women, his distinctive blend of the mysterious and the everyday, of melancholy and humour, continues to enchant readers, ensuring Murakami&#39;s place as one of the world&#39;s most acclaimed and well-loved writers.&#34;How does Murakami manage to make poetry while writing of contemporary life and emotions? I am weak-kneed with admiration&#34; * Independent on Sunday * &#34;Imagine our joy when Vintage announced that it is publishing a collection of easily digestible books from the world&#39;s most celebrated writers on the experiences that make us human...

He also establishes the possibility of attaining inner realization and developing our essential being&#x2014;"the pearl beyond price"&#x2014;in the context of living a normal human life.</p><p><i>The Pearl Beyond Price</i> is number two in the three-book Diamond Mind series. The centerpiece of Almaas's transformational object relations psychology, in it he explains how an infant identifies with its primary caregivers and ends up losing its "essence" by replacing it with an ego-based personality. Dismantling this imprisoning edifice requires recognizing it in the first place, but once exposed for the false though necessary stage of reality it is, ego tends to dissolve of its own accord. Under the gentle guidance of Almaas, the various aspects of essence begin to emerge, one of them being the centrifugal "personal essence" ("the pearl beyond price"). Through integration of concepts from all the world's religions, though most specifically Sufism, with the latest concepts of depth psychology, Almaas provides the scientifically inclined a point of departure into metaphysical realms. While the presentation is somewhat technical--and therefore of use to psychologists, counselors, teachers, parents, and other serious-minded sorts--it is completely accessible to the generally educated reader. <i>--Randall Cohan</i>A. H. Almaas is the pen name of Hameed Ali, the Kuwaiti-born originator of the Diamond Approach, who has been guiding individuals and groups in Colorado, California, and Europe since 1976. He is the author of <i>Spacecrusier Inquiry</i>, <i>The Pearl Beyond Price</i>, <i>Facets of Unity</i>, and other books.&nbsp;<i> </i></p><h2>Why the Cross?</h2><p>Jesus Christ&#x2019;s death on the Cross is the central act of human existence which links every act of suffering, self-giving, or self-denial with God Himself. The author, a priest who wrote on the eve of World War II, forcefully makes the connection between the Crucifixion as the horrible expiation for all sins and the need for ordinary faithful to willingly embrace suffering in its various forms to find their way to God. The author shows how the problem of obtaining happiness is intrinsically bound up with the problem of pain. Sacrifices undertaken for faith do not make one unhappy, if that faith is made a reality in the constant and ordinary activities of life. &#x201c;Too many use their religion as medicine and not as food,&#x201d; Leen writes. &#x201c;They make of it a remedy for evil and not a means to good.&#x201d;</p><p></p><h2>LaTeX: A Document Preparation System</h2><p>LaTex is a software system for typesetting documents.

By carefully examining the context in which sculptures and paintings were produced, author Robin Osborne shows how artists responded to the challenges they faced in the formidable and ambitious world of the Greek city-state, producing the rich diversity of forms apparent in Greek art. Artistic developments of the period combined the influences of the symbolism and imagery of eastern Mediterranean art with the explorations of humanity embodied in the narratives of Greek poetry, while drawings and sculptures referred so intimately to the human form as to lead both ancient and modern theorists to talk in terms of the 'mimetic' role of art. Ranging widely over the fields of sculpture, vase painting, and the minor arts, and offering a wide selection of unusual images alongside the familiar masterpieces, this work discusses the changing forms of art, and how art was used to define men's relationships with other men, women, slaves, society, nature, and the gods.<br></p><p><br><strong>Robin Osborne</strong> is a Professor of Ancient History in the University of Oxford and Fellow and Tutor of Corpus Christi College.<br><br>"Brilliantly illustrates the purpose of this new series by focusing on the social and political context of Greek art...a different approach suggesting new perspectives and original connections....Eye-opening and thought-provoking."--Professor Fran�ois Lissarrague, Ecoles des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales, Paris<p></p><br></p><h2>The Theory of Corporate Finance</h2><p><p>The past twenty years have seen great theoretical and empirical advances in the field of corporate finance. Whereas once the subject addressed mainly the financing of corporations--equity, debt, and valuation--today it also embraces crucial issues of governance, liquidity, risk management, relationships between banks and corporations, and the macroeconomic impact of corporations. However, this progress has left in its wake a jumbled array of concepts and models that students are often hard put to make sense of.</p><br><p> Here, one of the world's leading economists offers a lucid, unified, and comprehensive introduction to modern corporate finance theory. Jean Tirole builds his landmark book around a single model, using an incentive or contract theory approach. Filling a major gap in the field, <i>The Theory of Corporate Finance</i> is an indispensable resource for graduate and advanced undergraduate students as well as researchers of corporate finance, industrial organization, political economy, development, and macroeconomics.</p><br><p> Tirole conveys the organizing principles that structure the analysis of today's key management and public policy issues, such as the reform of corporate governance and auditing; the role of private equity, financial markets, and takeovers; the efficient determination of leverage, dividends, liquidity, and risk management; and the design of managerial incentive packages. He weaves empirical studies into the book's theoretical analysis. And he places the corporation in its broader environment, both microeconomic and macroeconomic, and examines the two-way interaction between the corporate environment and institutions.</p><br><p> Setting a new milestone in the field, <i>The Theory of Corporate Finance</i> will be the authoritative text for years to come.</p></p><p><p>"Using a single elementary model Tirole brings out with refreshing ease an unsuspected unity and simplicity in a field that might otherwise be perceived as dishearteningly fragmented and complex. This masterful book will be a formidable teaching tool at the graduate level and an essential reference for research in corporate finance."<b>--Marco Pagano, Professor of Economics, University of Naples Federico II</b></p><p>"The field of corporate finance has developed rapidly and extensively in the last twenty years, but those who want to teach it face a barrier: the absence of a widely accepted textbook. Jean Tirole's book fills that gap. Applying his celebrated analytical and expositional skills, Tirole synthesizes and unifies the field in a clear and accessible manner, emphasizing particularly the connections between corporate finance and contract theory and the role of incentives and control in firms' financial decisions. The result is a book that will be an important resource for students and teachers alike."<b>--Oliver Hart, Andrew E. Furer Professor of Economics, Harvard University</b></p><p>"With this book, Tirole has provided a comprehensive treatment of modern corporate finance theory in one place with one integrated framework. As a bonus, he also describes many of the important empirical results in corporate finance and how they relate to the theories. The book will be a valuable asset to students (and professors) of corporate finance."<b>--Steve Kaplan, Neubauer Family Professor of Entrepreneurship and Finance, University of Chicago Graduate School of Business</b></p><p>"This is a remarkable book. Theoretical work in corporate finance over the past thirty or so years has yielded a bewildering array of individual models, yet Tirole manages to give a beautifully clear and unified treatment of the field. There is a real coherence both within and across the chapters, and one is in many places able to see the close connection between topics that are ordinarily treated as being distinct. The book will no doubt be the standard reference for researchers and students in corporate finance for many years to come."<b>--Jeremy C. Stein, Harvard University</b></p><p>"Jean Tirole, one of the preeminent economists of his generation, has put together the first integrated treatise of modern corporate finance theory. He succeeds in unifying the dispersed theories on financial and ownership structure, building on his excellence in information economics and contract theory. The book should be required reading for any Ph.D. course in corporate finance."<b>--Arnoud W. A. Boot, University of Amsterdam and Centre for Economic Policy Research</b></p><p>"<i>The Theory of Corporate Finance</i> is a towering achievement. Jean Tirole's vision is exhaustive, systematic and original. The major findings of the last two decades are recast in a unified framework, describing the multiple levels of contracting relationships created by firms' financial decisions. The book offers a significant number of new insights and it will have a profound impact on our understanding of corporate finance."<b>--Antoine Faure-Grimaud, Professor of Finance, London School of Economics</b></p><b>Jean Tirole</b>, the winner of the 2014 Nobel Prize in Economics, is chairman of the Foundation Jean-Jacques Laffont at the Toulouse School of Economics, scientific director of Toulouse's Industrial Economics Institute, and annual visiting professor of economics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Detective-Adjutant Gripstra and Sergeant de Gier of the Amsterdam police are sent to investigate what looks like a simple suicide, but they are immediately suspicious of the circumstances.<br><br>This now-classic novel, first published in 1975, introduces Janwillem van de Wetering&#x2019;s lovable Amsterdam cop duo of portly, wise Gripstra and handsome, contemplative de Gier. With its unvarnished depiction of the legacy of Dutch colonialism and the darker facets of Amsterdam&#x2019;s free drug culture, this excellent procedural asks the question of whether a murder may ever be justly committed.</p><p>Janwillem van de Wetering (1931&#x2013;2008) was born and raised in Rotterdam, but lived most recently in Surry, Maine.

He is renowned for his detective fiction, including <i>Outsider in Amsterdam</i>; <i>The Corpse on the Dike</i>; the short story collection <i>The Sergeant&#x2019;s Cat</i>; <i>The Maine Massacre</i>, which garnered him the Grand Prix de Litt�rature Polici�re; and ten other books in the Amsterdam Cops series.Grijpstra dug in his wallet and after a while his square fat fingers found his police identification with its blue and red stripes and photograph of a much younger Grijpstra dressed in uniform with the silver button of his rank on both shoulders.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dark man bent forward and read the card.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;H. F. Grijpstra,&#x201d; he read in a clear voice. &#x201c;Adjutant. Municipal Police of Amsterdam.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He paused.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I have seen it. Please come in.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Extraordinary,&#x201d; de Gier thought. &#x201c;Fascinating. That fellow actually read the card. It never happens. Grijpstra always shows his credit card and nobody ever notices anything. He could have shown a receipt from the electricity department and nobody would object, but this chap really reads the identification.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who are you?&#x201d; Grijpstra was asking.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Jan Karel van Meteren,&#x201d; the man said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were in the corridor. There were three doors on the right, heavy oak doors. One of the doors was open and de Gier saw a bar and several young men with long hair and one elderly man with a bald head. Everybody was drinking beer. He had a glance of another young man behind the bar, dressed in a white T-shirt and decorated with a necklace of colored stones. Van Meteren was leading the way and they followed obediently. A staircase at the end of the corridor, again made of oak and recently polished. The floor of the corridor was covered with slabs of marble, cracked but very clean. Near the staircase Grijpstra noticed a niche with an upright Indian figure, made of bronze, life-size and with the right hand raised in a gesture of solemn greeting. Perhaps the gesture symbolized a blessing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They climbed the staircase and came into a large open space with a high ceiling made of iron, painted white and with a relief of garlands picked out in gold. This was the restaurant, occupying the entire floor. De Gier counted ten tables, six seating four persons and four seating six persons. Nearly every chair was taken.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grijpstra had stopped while their guide waited patiently. He was admiring a statue, standing on a stone platform attached to the wall. It was a statue of a female deity, performing a dance. The noble head on its slender neck seemed to contrast at first with the full breasts and the lewdly raised foot and Grijpstra was surprised that this naked sexual figure represented divinity and that he accepted her divinity. Undoubtedly the figure was free, quiet, detached and powerful. Superior. The thought flitted through his head. Superior. And free. Especially free. The thought disappeared as he walked on. De Gier had seen the statue but hadn&#x2019;t allowed himself to be interested. He watched the guests without fixing any one of them in particular. A fixed stare is aggressive and invites attention. He didn&#x2019;t want any attention and didn&#x2019;t get any. The guests took him for another guest and thought he wanted to join them. One man took his hat and briefcase off a chair and made an inviting gesture. De Gier smiled and shook his head. He noticed that nobody seemed to talk, perhaps they were listening to the music that came from several stereo loudspeakers and was hitting the room in waves. De Gier liked the music; it reminded him of a performance in the Tropical Museum. The heavy rhythmical cords would come from a bass guitar and the dry sharp knocks from a set of drums; he imagined that the wheezing high notes setting the melody itself would be a flute, a bamboo flute probably.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were moving again, still following van Meteren. He led them through the restaurant and into a long narrow kitchen; through its windows there was a view of a garden full of red and pink rhododendrons. Two girls in jeans were busily stirring pots on a large stove. There was a sharp but not unpleasant smell of weird herbs. One of the girls wanted to object to the presence of strangers but stopped herself when she saw van Meteren.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was another narrow staircase and another corridor. White walls and several doors. They passed three doors and van Meteren opened the last, fourth, door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Gier had a feeling that they had now penetrated into the secret part of the house; perhaps the silence of the corridor motivated the thought. The music of the restaurant didn&#x2019;t reach this lofty level. Grijpstra entered the room and sighed. He saw the corpse and it moved, exactly as he had expected. It would be the draft, of course, all phenomena can be explained, but the slow ghastly movement chilled his spine. De Gier had now come in as well and watched silently. He noticed the small bare feet with their neat toes, pointed at the floor. His gaze wandered upward and recorded the protruding tongue and the wide open bulging blue eyes. A small corpse that had belonged to a living man. A little over five feet. A thin man, well dressed in khaki trousers of good cloth, nicely ironed, and a freshly laundered striped shirt. Some forty years old. Long thick dark red hair and a full mustache, hanging down at the corners by its own weight. De Gier moved closer and looked at the corpse&#x2019;s wrist watch. He grunted. A very expensive watch, worth a small fortune. He couldn&#x2019;t remember ever having seen a gold strap of such width and such quality.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both officers froze and quietly looked around, noticing as many details as possible. Almost automatically they had put their hands in their pockets. They had been trained in the same school. Hands in pockets cannot touch anything. This silent room was bound to be full of indications, traces, tracks.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw a large room, again with a high ceiling but not made of cast iron but of plain sawn planks supported by heavy deal beams. There were several bookcases, well filled. There was a telephone in one of the bookcases, and an expensive TV set and a new complete encyclopedia. The furniture consisted of a low settee, a table and three chairs. There were some cushions on the floor, embroidered. The patterns were unusual. Eastern designs probably, de Gier thought. There was a typewriter on the table with a letter in it. De Gier bent down.<br><br>Dear Sirs:<br> I thank you for your letter of the tenth and have to inform you<br><br>No further text. The letterhead looked expensive. hindist society, the address and the telephone number.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They saw a footstool, lying on its side, near the feet of the corpse. They saw a gramophone, a stack of records and a low bed covered with a batik cloth. The woven curtains were closed but allowed enough light to filter through to see every detail of the room.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;What&#x2019;s that?&#x201d; Grijpstra asked, pointing at another low table, covered with red lacquer and serving as a seat for a fairly large statue, a rather fat bald-headed man sitting cross-legged and staring at them with glass eyes.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;An altar of sorts,&#x201d; de Gier answered after some thought. &#x201c;That copper bowl filled with sand must be an incense burner, and the brown spots in the sand are burnt-out incense sticks.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grijpstra raised an eyebrow. &#x201c;You know a lot today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I visit museums,&#x201d; de Gier said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Grijpstra sniffed.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Incense?&#x201d; he asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Gier nodded. The heavy sweet smell gave him a headache.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Who discovered the body?&#x201d; de Gier asked van Met-eren, who was standing near the door.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I did,&#x201d; van Meteren answered. &#x201c;I had to ask Piet something and as he didn&#x2019;t answer when I knocked, I went back to my room. A little later I asked the girls in the kitchen if they had seen him and they said he had gone upstairs. I looked into the other rooms; one of them belongs to his mother, and another is the temple. He wasn&#x2019;t there. I thought he might be asleep and knocked again and then I opened the door and saw him hanging there. I telephoned the police and waited for you downstairs. Nobody knows anything yet.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Why didn&#x2019;t you cut the rope?&#x201d; asked de Gier.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;He was dead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;How did you know?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Van Meteren didn&#x2019;t answer.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Are you a doctor?&#x201d; Grijpstra asked.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;No,&#x201d; van Meteren said, &#x201c;but I have seen a lot of corpses in my life. Piet is dead. Dead is dead. I could feel it. A dead body has no feel.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;Did you touch it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Van Meteren shrugged his shoulders. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t have to feel a corpse to know it is dead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;So why didn&#x2019;t you cut the rope?&#x201d; asked de Gier again.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;I couldn&#x2019;t do it by myself,&#x201d; van Meteren said. &#x201c;Somebody would have had to hold the body. Besides, I wanted you to find it the way it was. Perhaps it will give you a lead.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; De Gier looked again at the corpse. He had an idea that he had seen the man before and searched his memory. De Gier&#x2019;s memory was well organized and he knew his way around his files. After a while he knew that he hadn&#x2019;t seen the man before but that the strong chin, the long hair and the heavy mustache reminded him of a portrait he had seen in a museum in The Hague. A portrait of a Dutch statesman of the sixteenth century, a statesman and a warrior, on his way to do battle. The warrior had been sitting on a horse and had a sword in his hand. A leader. Very likely this man had also been a leader, a boss. A little boss in charge of a small society. Discipline, de Gier thought. That&#x2019;s it. This house and this room reek of discipline. Everything is neat and clean. The girls in the kitchen are clean too, reasonably clean. Van Meteren is clean. There would be some connection between the corpse and van Meteren. Perhaps van Meteren is an employee of the Society. But why do I observe this? de Gier asked. The answer came immediately. He hadn&#x2019;t expected cleanliness when he had read the sign on the door. HINDUIST SOCIETY. He had associated the words with a mess. The new wisdom coming from the East is a messy business. He thought of the dirty doped vague shadowy people he had arrested in the street and interrogated at Police Headquarters. Petty theft, drug dealing in a small silly way, runaway minors, prostitution. All suspects stank. He had made them empty their pockets before locking them up and had been appalled at the dirty rags, the broken trinkets, the lack of money. He had seen the photographs they carried around with them. Pictures of &#x201c;holy men,&#x201d; &#x201c;gurus&#x201d; or &#x201c;yogis.&#x201d; Skeletons with long matted hair and crazy eyes. The masters preaching the way.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He had associated the word hindist with Hinduism or Buddhism. The religions of the East. Before he had begun to arrest the crazy tramps the words had had a different association. Peace and quiet, some form of detachment. Real wisdom. But gradually &#x201c;messiness" had crept in.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And now he had to admit that this place, this nest of nonsensical imitation faith, was, after all, clean. And he had been surprised. De Gier&#x2019;s thoughts took a few seconds only and meanwhile Grijpstra had sighed again. The body was dead, no doubt about it, and they would have to cut the rope. They had to assume that the body was still alive. Only a doctor can determine death. He looked over his shoulder and nodded at de Gier.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#x201c;You can telephone headquarters, if you like.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was no need to say it. De Gier was dialing the number already. He didn&#x2019;t have to say much. At headquarters the machine was already in operation. Within a few minutes they would be arriving. Doctor, ambulance and the experts.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While de Gier telephoned Grijpstra picked up the stool and put it right and climbed on top of it. He cut the rope with his switchblade, an illegal weapon that he carried against all regulations. The rope wasn&#x2019;t thick and the knife very sharp. De Gier wanted to catch the corpse but van Meteren was quicker. He put the corpse down, very carefully, on the bed. No one thought that Piet would start breathing again.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn&#x2019;t.</p><h2>How I Became One of the Invisible, new edition (Semiotext(e) / Native Agents)</h2><p><p><b>The only collection of Rattray's prose: essays that offer a kind of secret history and guidebook to a poetic and mystical tradition.</b></p><p>In order to become one of the invisible, it is necessary to throw oneself into the arms of God... Some of us stayed for weeks, some for months, some forever.<br>&#x2015;from <i>How I Became One of the Invisible</i></p><p>Since its first publication in 1992, David Rattray's <i>How I Became One of the Invisible</i> has functioned as a kind of secret history and guidebook to a poetic and mystical tradition running through Western civilization from Pythagoras to In Nomine music to H�lderlin and Antonin Artaud. Rattray not only excavated this tradition, he embodied and lived it. He studied at Harvard and the Sorbonne but remained a poet, outside the academy. His stories &#x201c;Van&#x201d; and &#x201c;The Angel&#x201d; chronicle his travels in southern Mexico with his friend, the poet Van Buskirk, and his adventures after graduating from Dartmouth in the mid-1950s. Eclipsed by the more mediagenic Beat writers during his lifetime, Rattray has become a powerful influence on contemporary artists and writers.</p><p>Living in Paris, Rattray became the first English translator of Antonin Artaud, and he understood Artaud's incisive scholarship and technological prophecies as few others would. As he writes of his translations in <i>How I Became One of the Invisible</i>, &#x201c;You have to identify with the man or the woman. If you don't, then you shouldn't be translating it. Why would you translate something that you didn't think had an important message for other people? I translated Artaud because I wanted to turn my friends on and pass a message that had relevance to our lives. Not to get a grant, or be hired by an English department.&#x201d;</p><p>Compiled in the months before his untimely death at age 57, <i>How I Became One of the Invisible </i>is the only volume of Rattray's prose. This new edition, edited by Robert Dewhurst, includes five additional pieces, two of them previously unpublished.</p></p><p>David Rattray (1946&#x2013;1993) was a poet, translator and scholar, fluent in most Western languages, Sanskrit, Latin, and Greek. He translated the works of Antonin Artaud, Ren� Crevel, Roger Gilbert-Lecomte, among others.<br><br>Chris Kraus is the author of four novels, including <i>I Love Dick </i>and <i>Summer of Hate</i>; two books of art and cultural criticism; and most recently, <i>After Kathy Acker: A Literary Biography</i>.

Neihardt</h2><p>In <i>Black Elk Speaks</i> and <i>When the Tree Flowered</i>, John C. Neihardt recorded the teachings of the Oglala holy man Black Elk, who had, in a vision, seen himself as the "sixth grandfather," the spiritual representative of the earth and of mankind. Raymond J. DeMallie makes available for the first time the transcripts from Neihardt's interviews with Black Elk in 1931 and 1944, which formed the basis for the two books.

She had woken up without any concept of who, where, or what she was. She awoke to the fundamental, luminous state of being that is without any separation, that experiences itself as pure love. Like great spiritual masters from many traditions, she knew she had reached the end of confusion and suffering. That was the moment she burst into laughter. Determined to give people a way to discover for themselves what she had realized, Katie developed a simple method of self-enquiry that she called The Work, a life-transforming system for discarding the stories we tell ourselves, which are the source of suffering, and replacing them with the truth (&#34;what is&#34;) and a life of total joy. She began teaching The Work wherever she was invited - at first in small, informal gatherings and eventually to packed workshops around the world. The Work consists of only four simple questions that you can apply to any problem. It is so easy and practical - but also profound in its application.</p><p>Remember the phrase "question authority"? <i>Loving What Is</i> is a workbook on questioning authority--but in this case, what is in question is the authority of our own fundamental beliefs about our relationships. <p> Known simply as "The Work," Byron Katie's methods are clean and straightforward. The basis is a series of four questions addressed to your own lists of written assumptions. Whether you're angry with your boss, frustrated with your teen's behavior, or appalled at the state of the world's environment, Katie suggests you write down your most honest thoughts on the matter, and then begin the examination. Starting with, "Is it true?" and continuing with explorations of "Who would you be without that thought?" this method allows you to get through unhelpful preconceptions and find peace. An integral part of the process is "turning the thought around," and at first this can seem like you're simply blaming yourself for everything. Push a little harder, and you'll find a very responsible acceptance of reality, beyond questions of fault and blame.</p><p> The book is filled with examples of folks applying The Work to a variety of life situations, and reading other's examples gets the idea across pretty clearly; chances are you'll find your own frustrations echoed on the pages a few times. Many chapters are divided into specific topics, such as couples, money, addictions, and self-judgments, with one chapter devoted to exploring the method with children. </p><p> Questioning your own authority is never an easy process, but it seems well worth the potential rewards--stress-free choices, peace, and affection for those closest to you. <i>--Jill Lightner</i></p>&#x201c;Good Lord! Where did Byron Katie come from? She&#x2019;s the real McCoy. Her Work is amazingly effective&#x2014;a simple, straightforward antidote to the suffering we unnecessarily create for ourselves. She asks us to believe nothing, but provides a surprisingly effective and simple way to cut through the tangle of delusions we wrap ourselves in. Just reading the exchanges in Loving What Is, I can admit things I didn&#x2019;t want to admit and stop torturing myself in ways I didn&#x2019;t realize I was doing.&#x201d; -- David Chadwick, author of <b>Crooked Cucumber: The Life and Zen Teaching of Shunryu Suzuki</b><br><br>&#x201c;Suppose you could find a simple way to embrace your life with joy, stop arguing with reality, and achieve serenity in the midst of chaos? That is what <b>Loving What Is </b>offers. It is no less than a revolutionary way to live your life. The question is: are we brave enough to accept it?&#x201d; -- Erica Jong, author of <b>Fear of Flying</b><br><br>&#x201c;Byron Katie&#x2019;s Work is a great blessing for our planet. The root cause of suffering is identification with our thoughts, the &#x2018;stories&#x2019; that are continuously running through our minds. Byron Katie&#x2019;s Work acts like a razor-sharp sword that cuts through that illusion and enables you to know for yourself the timeless essence of your being. Joy, peace, and love emanate from it as your natural state. In <b>Loving What Is</b>, you have the key. Now use it.&#x201d; -- Eckhart Tolle, author of <b>The Power of Now</b><br><br>&#x201c;Loving What Is is filled with the essence of wisdom.

He coauthored (with Stephen Cummings)<i> Everbody's Guide to Homeopathic Medicines,</i> which is one of the most popular guidebooks to using homeopathic medicines. Dana is the founder and President of the Foundation for Homeopathic Education and Research, is an elected Board member of the National Center for Homeopathy, and directs Homeopathic Educational Services, a primary distributor of homeopathic books, tapes, and medicine kits in the United States."The important concepts of homeopathy should be studied most seriously not only by those in medicine but in all social sciences. Dana Ullman's book is an eye-opener!"<br>- Robert Muller<br><br>"Too often books on alternative medicine resort to doctor-baiting and mellow-speak psychobabble. This book does neither. The author states his case for homeopathy well by citing numerous double-blind laboratory and clinical studies that merit the attention of medical professionals and the general public alike."<br>- Marvin McMillen</p><h2>Winnicott</h2><p><p>Although he founded no school of his own, D. W. Winnicott (1896&#x2013;1971) is now regarded as one of the most influential contributors to psychoanalysis since Freud. In over forty years of clinical practice, he brought unprecedented skill and intuition to the psychoanalysis of children. This critical new work by Adam Phillips presents the best short introduction to the thought and practice of Winnicott that is currently available.</p><p>Winnicott&#x2019;s work was devoted to the recognition and description of the good mother and the use of the mother&#x2013;infant relationship as the model of psychoanalytic treatment. His belief in natural development became a covert critique of overinterpretative methods of psychoanalysis. He combined his idiosyncratic approach to psychoanalysis with a willingness to make his work available to nonspecialist audiences. In this book Winnicott takes his place with Melanie Klein and Jacques Lacan as one of the great innovators within the psychoanalytic tradition.</p></p><p>Adam Phillips is Principal Child Psychotherapist in the Wolverton Gardens Child and Family Consultation Centre, London.&#x201c;A charming new book...that sums up the work of the British psychoanalyst D. W. Winnicott, the only major therapist I know of whose language would have pleased a poet... [Winnicott&#x2019;s] depiction of the beginning of human life is a kind of wry sublime. The infant&#x2019;s relation to his mother, he says, is one of utter ruthlessness. He uses her in an absolute way, as if this were her destiny. Gradually, by making herself less available to him, the mother &#x2018;disillusions&#x2019; the infant. Then, the wind knocked out of him, he is obliged to <i>reconsider</i> his ruthlessness... According to Mr. Phillips, Winnicott believed that this early experience sets a pattern for life, which is &#x2018;a continual and increasingly sophisticated illusionment&#x2015;disillusionment&#x2015;re-illusionment process.&#x2019; Winnicott suggested that the artist&#x2019;s ruthlessness resembled, even repeated, the infant&#x2019;s. In the absence of a mother, the critic has to disillusion and re-illusion the artist. In therapy, the analyst does it for the patient.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Anatole Broyard</b><b>, </b><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;A distinguished addition to the growing body of literature on the most important native-born English psychoanalyst.

By deftly weaving bits of biographical information into the narrative, the author places Winnicott in historical perspective, illuminating his often tactfully disguised quarrels with his predecessors, Freud and Klein, and suggesting how personal preoccupations became theoretical arguments in Winnicott&#x2019;s intuitive and idiosyncratic mind.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Mary Hayden</b><b>, </b><b><i>Science Books &amp; Films</i></b></p><h2>Death at Whitechapel (Robin Paige Victorian Mysteries, No. 6)</h2><p>Kathryn Ardleigh and her husband, Charles, are called on for help when scandal threatens Jennie Jerome Churchill.

Seventy-four hours later, the Americans controlled the country and one of the most valuable wartime ports: Casablanca.<br>In the years preceding, Casablanca had evolved from an exotic travel destination to a key military target after France's surrender to Germany. Jewish refugees from Europe poured in, hoping to obtain visas and passage to the United States and beyond. Nazi agents and collaborators infiltrated the city in search of power and loyalty. The resistance was not far behind, as shopkeepers, celebrities, former French Foreign Legionnaires, and disgruntled bureaucrats formed a network of Allied spies. But once in American hands, Casablanca became a crucial logistical hub in the fight against Germany--and the site of Roosevelt and Churchill's demand for "unconditional surrender."<br>Rife with rogue soldiers, power grabs, and diplomatic intrigue, <i>Destination Casablanca</i> is the riveting and untold story of this glamorous city--memorialized in the classic film that was rush-released in 1942 to capitalize on the drama that was unfolding in North Africa at the heart of World War II.</p><p><b>Meredith Hindley</b> is a historian and senior writer for <i>Humanities</i>, the quarterly review of the National Endowment for the Humanities. Her work has also appeared in the <i>New York Times, Salon, Christian Science Monitor,</i> and <i>Barnes and Noble Review</i>. Hindley received her PhD from American University. She lives in Washington, DC.<p>"Hindley delivers what could become the definitive account of Casablanca during World War II... The book should prove indispensable to scholars... Expertly researched and absorbing."--<strong><em>Kirkus Reviews</em></strong></p> <p>"Hindley's warm, detailed writing style portrays the determination and resources that America brought to Casablanca, the continuing plight of refugees, the stirrings of Moroccan nationalism, and the moving saga of American singer Josephine Baker's support for a free France. Extensively researched, this account is rife with personal accounts, political and diplomatic insights, and vivid depictions of the military process. Recommended for history buffs who will relish the author's skilled presentation of a little-known theater in World War II."--<strong><em>Library Journal</em></strong></p> <p>"A compelling read, packed with a Casablanca-worthy cast of characters and a penetrating look at the inside workings of Vichy France...History buffs will love the colorful stories and the grand geopolitical scheming. But there's enough action, intrigue, and adventure to make Destination Casablanca a perfect beach read."--<strong><em>Foreign Policy</em></strong></p> <p>"A fulcrum of history-wartime Casablanca-jumps to life in Meredith Hindley's masterful page-turner. Spies, jazz legends, generals, traitors, writers, war icons and assassins light up a tale of high-stakes intrigue in one of the world's great exotic settings."--Jonathan W. Jordan, bestselling author of <strong><em>Brothers, Rivals, Victors: Eisenhower, Patton, Bradley and the Partnership that Drove the Allied Conquest in Europe</em></strong></p> <p>"Meredith Hindley deftly weaves together a history of the city of Casablanca and the events leading to the Anglo-American invasion and conquest of Northwest Africa in 1942-1943. Fascinating characters such as performer Josephine Baker and writer Arthur Koestler, along with a multitude of refugees, spies, and resistance fighters give her account unusual texture and variety. The military successes were capped by the Casablanca summit conference of Franklin Roosevelt and Winston Churchill. A great read."--<strong>Richard Breitman, Distinguished Professor Emeritus, American University</strong></p> <p>"Here is an important, well-researched, and well-written account of a major aspect of World War II that is generally neglected in the existing literature. The reader is offered a convincing picture of the complicated interactions of the Americans and British with the supporters of Vichy and of the Free French, the local Muslim and Jewish leaders and population, and the agents of Germany. This reader does not know of any other successful unravelling of this theater's complexities."--<strong>Gerhard L. Weinberg, Professor Emeritus, University of North Carolina</strong></p> <p>"This is a book for historians, not film buffs...

The weather might have warmed up, but the wind off the East River could still be brutal. It carried with it a faint chemical smell, mixed with the Brooklyn smell of asphalt, gasoline, and burned sugar from the abandoned factory down the street.<br> <br>Simon was waiting for her on the front porch, sprawled in a broken-springed armchair. He had his DS balanced on his blue-jeaned knees and was poking away at it industriously with the stylus. &#x201c;Score,&#x201d; he said as she came up the steps. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m kicking butt at Mario Kart.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary pushed her hood back, shaking hair out of her eyes, and rummaged in her pocket for her keys. &#x201c;Where have you been? I&#x2019;ve been calling you all morning.&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon got to his feet, shoving the blinking rectangle into his messenger bag. &#x201c;I was at Eric&#x2019;s. Band practice.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary stopped jiggling the key in the lock&#x2014;it always stuck&#x2014;long enough to frown at him. &#x201c;Band practice? You mean you&#x2019;re still&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;In the band? Why wouldn&#x2019;t I be?&#x201d; He reached around her. &#x201c;Here, let me do it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary stood still while Simon expertly twisted the key with just the right amount of pressure, making the stubborn old lock spring open. His hand brushed hers; his skin was cool, the temperature of the air outside. She shivered a little. They&#x2019;d only called off their attempt at a romantic relationship last week, and she still felt confused whenever she saw him.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d; She took the key back without looking at him.<br> <br>It was hot in the living room. Clary hung her jacket up on the peg inside the front hall and headed to the spare bedroom, Simon trailing in her wake. She frowned. Her suitcase was open like a clamshell on the bed, her clothes and sketchbooks strewn everywhere.<br> <br>&#x201c;I thought you were just going to be in Idris a couple of days,&#x201d; Simon said, taking in the mess with a look of faint dismay.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am, but I can&#x2019;t figure out what to pack. I hardly own any dresses or skirts, but what if I can&#x2019;t wear pants there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Why wouldn&#x2019;t you be able to wear pants there? It&#x2019;s another country, not another century.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But the Shadowhunters are so old-fashioned, and Isabelle always wears dresses&#x2014;&#x201d; Clary broke off and sighed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s nothing. I&#x2019;m just projecting all my anxiety about my mom onto my wardrobe. Let&#x2019;s talk about something else. How was practice? Still no band name?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It was fine.&#x201d; Simon hopped onto the desk, legs dangling over the side. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re considering a new motto. Something ironic, like &#x2018;We&#x2019;ve seen a million faces and rocked about eighty percent of them.&#x2019;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Have you told Eric and the rest of them that&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That I&#x2019;m a vampire? No. It isn&#x2019;t the sort of thing you just drop into casual conversation.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe not, but they&#x2019;re your friends. They should know. And besides, they&#x2019;ll just think it makes you more of a rock god, like that vampire Lester.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Lestat,&#x201d; Simon said. &#x201c;That would be the vampire Lestat. And he&#x2019;s fictional. Anyway, I don&#x2019;t see you running to tell all your friends that you&#x2019;re a Shadowhunter.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What friends? You&#x2019;re my friend.&#x201d; She threw herself down onto the bed and looked up at Simon. &#x201c;And I told you, didn&#x2019;t I?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because you had no choice.&#x201d; Simon put his head to the side, studying her; the bedside light reflected off his eyes, turning them silver. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you while you&#x2019;re gone.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll miss you, too,&#x201d; Clary said, although her skin was prickling all over with a nervous anticipation that made it hard to concentrate. I&#x2019;m going to Idris! her mind sang. I&#x2019;ll see the Shadow-hunter home country, the City of Glass. I&#x2019;ll save my mother.<br> <br>And I&#x2019;ll be with Jace.<br> <br>Simon&#x2019;s eyes flashed as if he could hear her thoughts, but his voice was soft. &#x201c;Tell me again&#x2014;why do you have to go to Idris? Why can&#x2019;t Madeleine and Luke take care of this without you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;My mom got the spell that put her in this state from a warlock&#x2014;Ragnor Fell. Madeleine says we need to track him down if we want to know how to reverse the spell. But he doesn&#x2019;t know Madeleine. He knew my mom, and Madeleine thinks he&#x2019;ll trust me because I look so much like her. And Luke can&#x2019;t come with me. He could come to Idris, but apparently he can&#x2019;t get into Alicante without permission from the Clave, and they won&#x2019;t give it. And don&#x2019;t say anything about it to him, please&#x2014;he&#x2019;s really not happy about not going with me. If he hadn&#x2019;t known Madeleine before, I don&#x2019;t think he&#x2019;d let me go at all.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But the Lightwoods will be there too. And Jace. They&#x2019;ll be helping you. I mean, Jace did say he&#x2019;d help you, didn&#x2019;t he? He doesn&#x2019;t mind you coming along?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sure, he&#x2019;ll help me,&#x201d; Clary said. &#x201c;And of course he doesn&#x2019;t mind. He&#x2019;s fine with it.&#x201d;<br> <br>But that, she knew, was a lie.<br> <br>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br> <br>Clary had gone straight to the Institute after she&#x2019;d talked to Madeleine at the hospital. Jace had been the first one she&#x2019;d told her mother&#x2019;s secret to, before even Luke. And he&#x2019;d stood there and stared at her, getting paler and paler as she spoke, as if she weren&#x2019;t so much telling him how she could save her mother as draining the blood out of him with cruel slowness.<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not going,&#x201d; he said as soon as she&#x2019;d finished. &#x201c;If I have to tie you up and sit on you until this insane whim of yours passes, you are not going to Idris.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary felt as if he&#x2019;d slapped her. She had thought he&#x2019;d be pleased. She&#x2019;d run all the way from the hospital to the Institute to tell him, and here he was standing in the entryway glaring at her with a look of grim death. &#x201c;But you&#x2019;re going.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, we&#x2019;re going. We have to go. The Clave&#x2019;s called every active Clave member who can be spared back to Idris for a massive Council meeting. They&#x2019;re going to vote on what to do about Valentine, and since we&#x2019;re the last people who&#x2019;ve seen him&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary brushed this aside. &#x201c;So if you&#x2019;re going, why can&#x2019;t I go with you?&#x201d;<br> <br>The straightforwardness of the question seemed to make him even angrier. &#x201c;Because it isn&#x2019;t safe for you there.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, and it&#x2019;s so safe here? I&#x2019;ve nearly been killed a dozen times in the past month, and every time it&#x2019;s been right here in New York.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s because Valentine&#x2019;s been concentrating on the two Mortal Instruments that were here.&#x201d; Jace spoke through gritted teeth. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s going to shift his focus to Idris now, we all know it&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;re hardly as certain of anything as all that,&#x201d; said Maryse Lightwood. She had been standing in the shadow of the corridor doorway, unseen by either of them; she moved forward now, into the harsh entryway lights. They illuminated the lines of exhaustion that seemed to draw her face down. Her husband, Robert Lightwood, had been injured by demon poison during the battle last week and had needed constant nursing since; Clary could only imagine how tired she must be. &#x201c;And the Clave wants to meet Clarissa. You know that, Jace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Clave can screw itself.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace,&#x201d; Maryse said, sounding genuinely parental for a change. &#x201c;Language.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The Clave wants a lot of things,&#x201d; Jace amended. &#x201c;It shouldn&#x2019;t necessarily get them all.&#x201d;<br> <br>Maryse shot him a look, as if she knew exactly what he was talking about and didn&#x2019;t appreciate it. &#x201c;The Clave is often right, Jace. It&#x2019;s not unreasonable for them to want to talk to Clary, after what she&#x2019;s been through. What she could tell them&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll tell them whatever they want to know,&#x201d; Jace said.<br> <br>Maryse sighed and turned her blue eyes on Clary. &#x201c;So you want to go to Idris, I take it?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just for a few days. I won&#x2019;t be any trouble,&#x201d; Clary said, gazing entreatingly past Jace&#x2019;s white-hot glare at Maryse. &#x201c;I swear.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;The question isn&#x2019;t whether you&#x2019;ll be any trouble; the question is whether you&#x2019;ll be willing to meet with the Clave while you&#x2019;re there. They want to talk to you. If you say no, I doubt we can get the authorization to bring you with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No&#x2014;,&#x201d; Jace began.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll meet with the Clave,&#x201d; Clary interrupted, though the thought sent a ripple of cold down her spine. The only emissary of the Clave she&#x2019;d known so far was the Inquisitor, who hadn&#x2019;t exactly been pleasant to be around.<br> <br>Maryse rubbed at her temples with her fingertips. &#x201c;Then it&#x2019;s settled.&#x201d; She didn&#x2019;t sound settled, though; she sounded as tense and fragile as an overtightened violin string. &#x201c;Jace, show Clary out and then come see me in the library. I need to talk to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>She disappeared back into the shadows without even a word of farewell. Clary stared after her, feeling as if she&#x2019;d just been drenched with ice water. Alec and Isabelle seemed genuinely fond of their mother, and she was sure Maryse wasn&#x2019;t a bad person, really, but she wasn&#x2019;t exactly warm.<br> <br>Jace&#x2019;s mouth was a hard line. &#x201c;Now look what you&#x2019;ve done.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I need to go to Idris, even if you can&#x2019;t understand why,&#x201d; Clary said. &#x201c;I need to do this for my mother.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Maryse trusts the Clave too much,&#x201d; said Jace. &#x201c;She has to believe they&#x2019;re perfect, and I can&#x2019;t tell her they aren&#x2019;t, because&#x2014;&#x201d; He stopped abruptly.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because that&#x2019;s something Valentine would say.&#x201d;<br> <br>She expected an explosion, but &#x201c;No one is perfect&#x201d; was all he said. He reached out and stabbed at the elevator button with his index finger. &#x201c;Not even the Clave.&#x201d;<br> <br>Clary crossed her arms over her chest. &#x201c;Is that really why you don&#x2019;t want me to come? Because it isn&#x2019;t safe?&#x201d;<br> <br>A flicker of surprise crossed his face. &#x201c;What do you mean? Why else wouldn&#x2019;t I want you to come?&#x201d;<br> <br>She swallowed. &#x201c;Because&#x2014;&#x201d; Because you told me you don&#x2019;t have feelings for me anymore, and you see, that&#x2019;s very awkward, because I still have them for you. And I bet you know it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because I don&#x2019;t want my little sister following me everywhere?&#x201d; There was a sharp note in his voice, half mockery, half something else.<br> <br>The elevator arrived with a clatter. Pushing the gate aside, Clary stepped into it and turned to face Jace. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m not going because you&#x2019;ll be there. I&#x2019;m going because I want to help my mother. Our mother. I have to help her. Don&#x2019;t you get it? If I don&#x2019;t do this, she might never wake up. You could at least pretend you care a little bit.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace put his hands on her shoulders, his fingertips brushing the bare skin at the edge of her collar, sending pointless, helpless shivers through her nerves. There were shadows below his eyes, Clary noticed without wanting to, and dark hollows under his cheekbones. The black sweater he was wearing only made his bruise-marked skin stand out more, and the dark lashes, too; he was a study in contrasts, something to be painted in shades of black, white, and gray, with splashes of gold here and there, like his eyes, for an accent color&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Let me do it.&#x201d; His voice was soft, urgent. &#x201c;I can help her for you. Tell me where to go, who to ask. I&#x2019;ll get what you need.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Madeleine told the warlock I&#x2019;d be the one coming. He&#x2019;ll be expecting Jocelyn&#x2019;s daughter, not Jocelyn&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jace&#x2019;s hands tightened on her shoulders. &#x201c;So tell her there was a change of plans. I&#x2019;ll be going, not you. Not you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do whatever,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Whatever you want, if you promise to stay here.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br> <br>He let go of her, as if she&#x2019;d pushed him away. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;she&#x2019;s my mother, Jace.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And mine.&#x201d; His voice was cold. &#x201c;In fact, why didn&#x2019;t Madeleine approach both of us about this? Why just you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You know why.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Because,&#x201d; he said, and this time he sounded even colder, &#x201c;to her you&#x2019;re Jocelyn&#x2019;s daughter. But I&#x2019;ll always be Valentine&#x2019;s son.&#x201d;<br> <br>He slammed the gate shut between them. For a moment she stared at him through it&#x2014;the mesh of the gate divided up his face into a series of diamond shapes, outlined in metal. A single golden eye stared at her through one diamond, furious anger flickering in its depths.<br> <br>&#x201c;Jace&#x2014;,&#x201d; she began.<br> <br>But with a jerk and a clatter, the elevator was already moving, carrying her down into the dark silence of the cathedral.<br> <br>*&nbsp;*&nbsp;*<br> <br>&#x201c;Earth to Clary.&#x201d; Simon waved his hands at her. &#x201c;You awake?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, sorry.&#x201d; She sat up, shaking her head to clear it of cobwebs. That had been the last time she&#x2019;d seen Jace. He hadn&#x2019;t picked up the phone when she&#x2019;d called him afterward, so she&#x2019;d made all her plans to travel to Idris with the Lightwoods using Alec as reluctant and embarrassed point person. Poor Alec, stuck between Jace and his mother, always trying to do the right thing. &#x201c;Did you say something?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Just that I think Luke is back,&#x201d; Simon said, and jumped off the desk just as the bedroom door opened. &#x201c;And he is.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Simon.&#x201d; Luke sounded calm, maybe a little tired&#x2014;he was wearing a battered denim jacket, a flannel shirt, and old cords tucked into boots that looked like they&#x2019;d seen their best days ten years ago. His glasses were pushed up into his brown hair, which seemed flecked with more gray now than Clary remembered. There was a square package under his arm, tied with a length of green ribbon. He held it out to Clary. &#x201c;I got you something for your trip.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You didn&#x2019;t have to do that!&#x201d; Clary protested. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve done so much. . . .&#x201d; She thought of the clothes he&#x2019;d bought her after everything she owned had been destroyed. He&#x2019;d given her a new phone, new art supplies, without ever having to be asked. Almost everything she owned now was a gift from Luke. And you don&#x2019;t even approve of the fact that I&#x2019;m going. That last thought hung unspoken between them.<br> <br>&#x201c;I know. But I saw it, and I thought of you.&#x201d; He handed over the box.<br> <br>The object inside was swathed in layers of tissue paper. Clary tore through it, her hand seizing on something soft as kitten&#x2019;s fur. She gave a little gasp. It was a bottle-green velvet coat, old-fashioned, with a gold silk lining, brass buttons, and a wide hood. She drew it onto her lap, smoothing her hands lovingly down the soft material. &#x201c;It looks like something Isabelle would wear,&#x201d; she exclaimed. &#x201c;Like a Shadowhunter traveling cloak.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Exactly. Now you&#x2019;ll be dressed more like one of them,&#x201d; Luke said. &#x201c;When you&#x2019;re in Idris.&#x201d;<br> <br>She looked up at him. &#x201c;Do you want me to look like one of them?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Clary, you are one of them.&#x201d; His smile was tinged with sadness. &#x201c;Besides, you know how they treat outsiders. Anything you can do to fit in . . .&#x201d;<br> <br>Simon made an odd noise, and Clary looked guiltily at him&#x2014;she&#x2019;d almost forgotten he was there. He was looking studiously at his watch. &#x201c;I should go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;But you just got here!&#x201d; Clary protested. &#x201c;I thought we could hang out, watch a movie or something&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You need to pack.&#x201d; Simon smiled, bright as sunshine after rain. She could almost believe there was nothing bothering him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll come by later to say good-bye before you go.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, come on,&#x201d; Clary protested. &#x201c;Stay&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t.&#x201d; His tone was final. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m meeting Maia.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh. Great,&#x201d; Clary said. Maia, she told herself, was nice. She was smart. She was pretty. She was also a werewolf. A werewolf with a crush on Simon. But maybe that was as it should be. Maybe his new friend should be a Downworlder. After all, he was a Downworlder himself now. Technically, he shouldn&#x2019;t even be spending time with Shadowhunters like Clary. &#x201c;I guess you&#x2019;d better go, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I guess I&#x2019;d better.&#x201d; Simon&#x2019;s dark eyes were unreadable. This was new&#x2014;she&#x2019;d always been able to read Simon before. She wondered if it was a side effect of the vampirism, or something else entirely. &#x201c;Good-bye,&#x201d; he said, and bent as if to kiss her on the cheek, sweeping her hair back w...</p><h2>The Sibyl in Her Grave (Hilary Tamar)</h2><p>Julia Larwood's Aunt Regina needs help. She and two friends pooled their modest resources and invested in equities. Now the tax man demands his due, but they've already spent the money. How can they dig themselves out of the tax hole? Even more to the point: Can the sin of capital gains trigger corporeal loss?<br><br>That's one for the sibyl, psychic counselor Isabella del Comino, who has offended Aunt Regina and her friends by moving into the rectory, plowing under a cherished garden, and establishing an aviary of ravens. When Isabella is found dead, all clues point to death by fiscal misadventure.<br><br>So Julia calls in an old friend and Oxford fellow, Professor Hilary Tamar, to follow a money trail that connects Aunt Regina to what appears to be capital fraud &#x2014; and capital crime. The two women couldn't have a better champion than the erudite Hilary, as once again Sarah Caudwell sweeps us into the scene of the crime, leaving us to ponder the greatest mystery of all: Hilary, him &#x2014; or her &#x2014; self.</p><p>For mystery lovers and literary connoisseurs alike, 2000 was a year of loss. Gone are two masters of language, one with over 30 works to his credit (George V. Higgins), the other with only four (Sarah Caudwell). It is some comfort that each gave readers one last glimpse of literary skill before passing on: Higgins (<i>At End of Day</i>) captured the way people really speak; Caudwell captured the way many people would dearly love to speak. Her first three novels (<i>The Shortest Way to Hades</i>, <i>Thus Was Adonis Murdered</i>, <i>The Sirens Sang of Murder</i>) brought readers into the elegant, urbane world of Hilary Tamar, Oxford fellow and mentor to London barristers Cantrip, Selena, Ragwort, and Julia. Caudwell's last work, <i>The Sibyl in Her Grave</i>, continues the intoxicating blend of dry humor and genteel manners that marked her as a successor to Dorothy Sayers. <p> The sibyl of the title is the psychic counselor Isabella del Comino, who descends in a flurry of bad taste to the Sussex village of Parsons Haver. With an aviary of ravens, a frumpy niece, and a penchant for combining divinations and blackmail, her sudden death comes as a relief to the village's disgruntled inhabitants, including Julia's redoubtable Aunt Regina. Regina has enough to worry about: she and two friends pooled their resources and invested in equities--and made a killing. But now the tax man is demanding his share, and the money has already been spent. When she asks Julia for legal advice, Julia and her colleagues discover that both Regina's fiscal success and Isabella's death are connected to an insider-trading scandal brewing with Julia's biggest clients. Unraveling that connection, of course, is a task that falls to Hilary.</p><p> Hilary, who "labors always in the service of Scholarship," is a triumph of authorial ambiguity. After four novels, readers will be left wondering, apparently unto eternity, whether Professor Tamar is a man or a woman. Take it as a political statement if you will--or simply as another little mystery, courtesy of an author who reveled in the power of words to clarify, outline, elucidate, and obscure. <i>--Kelly Flynn</i></p>"Anyone who enjoys an ingenious mystery plot will enjoy Caudwell's."<br>&#x2014; <i>Newsday<br><br></i>A <i>New York Times</i> Notable Book of the Year<br><br>"Marvelous ...

The power flowing from the germanium far exceeded what went in; in that moment the transistor was invented and the Information Age was born. No other devices have been as crucial to modern life as the transistor and the microchip it spawned, but the story of the science and personalities that made these inventions possible has not been fully told until now. <em>Crystal Fire</em> fills this gap and carries the story forward. William Shockley, Bell Labs' team leader and co-recipient of the Nobel Prize with Brattain and Bardeen for the discovery, grew obsessed with the transistor and went on to become the father of Silicon Valley. Here is a deeply human story about the process of invention &#x2015; including the competition and economic aspirations involved &#x2015; all part of the greatest technological explosion in history.&nbsp;The intriguing history of the transistor &#x2015; its inventors, physics, and stunning impact on society and the economy &#x2015; unfolds here in a richly told tale."&#x2015;<em>Science News</em> "Thoroughly accessible to lay readers as well as the techno-savvy. . . . [A] fine book."&#x2015;<em>Publishers Weekly</em> Illustrated</p><p>The microchip at the heart of your computer is a complex device, but its historical origins go back to one crude-looking little gadget made up of a wedge of plastic, a strip of gold foil, a rough-hewn slab of crystallized germanium, some wires, and a bent-up paper clip. Slapped together by two Bell Labs experimenters on December 16, 1947, this invention later came to be known as the transistor, and it is the ancestor of every microchip in operation today.<p> <i>Crystal Fire</i> tells the story of the creation and development of that gadget, demonstrating that very little about the transistor's invention was as simple it seemed. The device put together on that December day was no idle experiment, but the product of decades of high-level research--and the first major practical application of the esoteric quantum mechanics that had emerged from European particle physics at the beginning of the century.</p><p> Just as fascinating as the scientific background, though, is the story of the brains and events behind the invention of the transistor. The collaboration and rivalry of the three men credited with the invention--the brilliant John Bardeen, the likable Walter Brattain, and the appallingly driven William Shockley--hold center stage. However, authors Riordan and Hoddeson make it clear that the unique organizational resources of Bell Labs, the furious course of the war effort, and the random twists and turns of historical accident played equally important roles. The saga makes for a gripping read and a crash course in the dizzying complexity of information-age invention. <i>--Julian Dibbell</i></p><p>Stanford University physicist <strong>Michael Riordan</strong> has written several popular books on science and technology.

What qualities mark the culture that has produced Moses, Christ, Spinoza, Marx, Freud, and Einstein? From ancient Palestine through Europe and the Orient, to America and modern Israel, Max I. Dimont shows how the saga of the Jews is interwoven with the story of virtually every nation on earth. This is a tale of a people escaping annihilation, fighting, falling back, advancing&#x2014;a lively and fascinating look at how the Jews have contributed to humankind&#x2019;s spiritual and intellectual heritage in remarkable ways, and across a remarkable span of history.</p><p>Max I. Dimont, author of <b>The Indestructible Jews, The Jews in America, The Amazing Adventures of the Jewish People,</b> and <b>Appointment in Jerusalem</b>, was born in Helsinki, Finland, and came to the United States in 1930. He taught himself English by reading Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, the Bible, and American plays translated into Finnish. After serving in intelligence with the U.S. Army during World War II, he worked in public relations and employee relations for Edison Brothers Stores in St. Louis. Following the first publication of the bestselling <b>Jews, God and History</b>, he lectured extensively on Jewish history throughout the United States, Canada, South Africa, Brazil, and Finland until his death in 1992.Referencing the Old Testament and Palestine&#39;s influence on world civilization, Finnish-American Dimont&#39;s secular history of the Jewish people was a surprise bestseller when originally published, and it has remained in print for more than twenty years. Deservedly so, for, despite quibbles from historians and religious partisans, the author has turned four thousand years in the life of one people into a lively, canny, authoritative, brainy and informative page-turner. To appreciate this audio, one must accept the kind of trade-offs encountered when a work that exists in space is translated into a work that exists in time. These include the inability to refer to indices, improbabilities of translating charts and graphs to sound, troubles going back and forth with footnotes, the need for heavy concentration to absorb the sheer density of data. On the plus side, one enjoys the accurate pronunciation of foreign words and phrases, as well as the narrator&#39;s animation of concepts and events. Anna Fields does a nice job here. Her listener-friendly cadences express not only the sense of the lines, but also the connections among ideas and the author&#39;s underlying intelligence. Be that as it may, to get the most out of the recording, one must still follow along with the text. Y.R.

In navigating this foreign landscape, Natalie illuminates a pathway through illness that is grounded in the fierce commitment to embrace the suffering directly. In the middle of this, her partner discovers that she too has cancer. The cancer twins, as Natalie calls them, must together and apart grapple with survival, love, and the rawness of human connection.

By not shielding us from her sorrow, we see more clearly our own. <i>Let the Whole Thundering World Come Home </i>is both generous and wise, glorious proof that our darkest moments are also our most illuminating, that being vulnerable is an act of true courage, and that often we are most present and awake when our future is uncertain.

Brilliant.&#x201d;&#x2014;Frank Ostaseski, author of<i> The Five Invitations: Discovering What Death Can Teach Us About Living Fully&nbsp;</i><br><br>&#x201c;In emotionally intense prose, Goldberg skillfully portrays the sorrow that can invade relationships when people are dealing with cancer ('Cancer demanded that I let the whole thundering world come home, that I accept the horror and unknown of human life&#x2014;and death') and recalls her anxiety about death, her fear of the lack of control over her condition, and her desire to avoid acknowledging the impermanence of life.

Or maybe I&#x2019;ve changed. The days when I was a single girl, living in Fulham with Suze and going round the shops every day, seem ages ago now. Yes, I used to spend too much. I&#x2019;ll freely admit it. I&#x2019;ve made mistakes. Like Frank Sinatra, I did it my way.<br><br>(Except &#x201c;my way&#x201d; involved stuffing Visa bills under the bed, which I bet Frank never did.)<br><br>But I&#x2019;ve learned some important lessons, which have genuinely changed the way I go about things. Like, for example:<br><br>1.I don&#x2019;t use carrier bags anymore. They used to be my biggest joy in life. Oh my God, the feel of a new carrier bag . . . the rope handles . . . the rustle of tissue paper . . . (I still sometimes go and swoon over my old collection at the back of the wardrobe.) But now I use a bag for life instead. Because of the planet and everything.<br><br>2.I&#x2019;m totally into ethical shopping. It&#x2019;s like a win-win! You get cool stuff and you&#x2019;re being virtuous.<br><br>3.I don&#x2019;t even spend money anymore. I save money.<br><br>OK. So obviously that&#x2019;s not exactly, actually, literally true. But the point is, I&#x2019;m always looking for a good deal. I see it as my responsibility as a parent to procure all the items that my family needs, at the most cost-effective prices possible. Which is why BargainFamily is the perfect place for me to shop. It&#x2019;s all reduced! Designer labels and everything!<br><br>The only thing is, you have to be a fast shopper, or else your basket expires and you have to start again. I&#x2019;m at �62.97 already, so all I need is another item around 12 quid. Come on, quick, there must be something I need. I click on an orange cardigan, �13.99, RRP �45, but when I zoom in, I see a horrible lacy border.<br><br>White shirt?<br><br>No, I bought a white shirt last week (100 percent linen, �29.99, RRP �99.99. I must remember to wear that, actually).<br><br>I click on my basket to double-check on what I&#x2019;ve already got, and a pop-up window bursts forth, announcing, You&#x2019;ve Saved �284 Today, Becky!<br><br>I feel a flash of pride as I survey my items. I&#x2019;ve saved a whole �284! I&#x2019;ve got an adorable bunny rabbit dressing gown for Minnie and a fantastic DKNY jacket, down from �299 to �39.99 in clearance, and a huge rubber ring shaped like a flamingo, which we can use next time we go on holiday.<br><br>And OK, yes, I could theoretically check out now and pay �5.95 for delivery. But that&#x2019;s not prudent. I&#x2019;m not a former financial journalist for nothing; I know these things. It&#x2019;s far more economically sound to find yourself something else that you need and get the free delivery.<br><br>Come on, there must be something. Tights? Everyone needs tights.<br><br>Oh, but I&#x2019;m always bumping up orders with tights. I have so many black opaques, they&#x2019;ll last me till I&#x2019;m 105. And those tartan-patterned ones I clicked on last week were a big mistake.<br><br>I click on Homewares and scroll down the items quickly. Silver antelope sculpture, was �79.99, now �12.99? Hmm, not sure. Scented candle? Oh God. No. I can&#x2019;t buy another one. Our whole house is like one big scented candle. In fact, Luke said the other day, &#x201c;Becky, is there any chance of buying a candle called Fresh Air?&#x201d;<br><br>I&#x2019;m just squinting at a bread bin shaped like Big Ben when a pop-up appears in front of my eyes&#x2014;Your Time Is Running Out, Becky!&#x2014;and my heart jumps in fright.<br><br>I wish they wouldn&#x2019;t do that. I know my time is running out.<br><br>&#x201c;I know!&#x201d; I hear myself saying out loud. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t stress me out!&#x201d;<br><br>Just to reassure myself, I click back on my basket again&#x2014;and my heart stops. The flamingo ring is sold out!<br><br>Sold out!<br><br>Noooo! I was too slow! Argh. The trouble with discount websites is, you can&#x2019;t see the people snatching bargains away from you. Now my heart really is thumping. I&#x2019;m not losing my jacket, nor Minnie&#x2019;s dressing gown. I need to fill this basket and check out, pronto.<br><br>&#x201c;Mummeee!&#x201d; Minnie&#x2019;s voice hails me from outside the door, immediately followed by Luke saying, &#x201c;Minnie! Darling, leave Mummy alone when she&#x2019;s doing her mindfulness. Sorry, Becky,&#x201d; he calls through the door. &#x201c;Didn&#x2019;t mean to disturb you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Er . . . that&#x2019;s OK!&#x201d; I call back, feeling a tiny stab of guilt.<br><br>I know Luke thinks I&#x2019;m sitting here peacefully doing my mindfulness meditation. And I was. In fact, it&#x2019;s still running in the corner of the screen, so in a way I am doing it, except I turned the volume down so I could concentrate on shopping.<br><br>It&#x2019;s become a bit of a routine, my mindfulness. I come into the study and turn on the meditation and it keeps me mentally well balanced. And just occasionally I log on to a shopping site too.<br><br>The thing is, the stock on the BargainFamily site changes every day, so it makes sense to check out Deals of the Day. Minnie needs a new dressing gown, so I started with that&#x2014;and then how could I not buy a DKNY jacket for �39.99? I mean, that&#x2019;s an insanely good bargain and it&#x2019;ll last me forever. Which meant that obviously I had to add some other items to get the free delivery. That&#x2019;s when I turned down the volume of the mindfulness guy. He&#x2019;s nice, but he&#x2019;s a bit serious and he distracts you from the task at hand.<br><br>Anyway, shopping is mindfulness, if you ask me. I&#x2019;ve forgotten about all my other worries right now. I&#x2019;m in the moment. I&#x2019;m in the zone.<br><br>I glance at the timer and my stomach flips over. Two mins thirty-four before my basket expires. Come on, Becky . . . <br><br>Hastily, I click on Accessories. That&#x2019;s the answer. You can&#x2019;t have too many accessories, can you? And I could always give one as a present.<br><br>I swiftly scroll down a page of boring clutch bags, weird hats, and nasty-looking gold necklaces. Every time a page loads, I feel a burst of optimism, but then my spirits fall. There&#x2019;s nothing. What&#x2019;s wrong with me? Am I that fussy?<br><br>I&#x2019;m starting to think I&#x2019;ll have to admit defeat and pay the delivery charge for the first time in my life, when the next page loads. And something catches in my throat. Can that be . . . <br><br>Are my eyes playing tricks on me?<br><br>I&#x2019;m staring at a turquoise printed gossamer silk scarf. Surely it can&#x2019;t be . . . <br><br>Denny and George? On BargainFamily? Seriously?<br><br>Blinking in disbelief, I read the description. Silk scarf, was �239, our price �30.<br><br>Thirty quid for a Denny and George scarf? Thirty quid?<br><br>I scroll down and there are two more underneath. All 100 percent silk. All stunning. All Limited stock. Shit. I need to hurry!<br><br>Without pausing to consider further, I start clicking. Buy. Buy. Buy. View Basket. Check Out. I feel like a virtuoso pianist, hitting all the right notes, on top of her game. And I&#x2019;ve made it with twenty seconds to spare! My basket is intact! My credit-card details are stored; this should take no time. . . .<br><br>Your password is not secure.<br><br>A pop-up has stopped me in my tracks, and I stare at it breathlessly. What&#x2019;s the problem now? I peer at the screen, reading the rest of the message.<br><br>Would you like to change your password? We suggest C?/x887dau.<br><br>I bet they do. Well, they can just sod off. My password is fine. Carefully, I type in Ermintrude2 and click a final Complete.<br><br>I lean back in my chair, panting as a new message appears on the screen. Congratulations! You saved �879 today!<br><br>I mean, it just shows. A penny saved is a penny earned, which means I&#x2019;ve effectively earned �879. In one online shopping session! If I made that every day, it would be . . . I shut my eyes, trying to calculate. Well, anyway, a six-figure salary. I think sometimes Luke doesn&#x2019;t appreciate this fact about me: that I&#x2019;m quietly generating our family thousands of pounds, all the time.</p><h2>Penguin Lost</h2><p>Viktor - last seen in Death and the Penguin fleeing Mafia vengeance on an Antarctica-bound flight booked for Penguin Misha - seizes a heaven-sent opportunity to return to Kiev with a new identity. Clear now as to the enormity of abandoning Misha, then convalescent from a heart-transplant, Viktor determines to make amends. Viktor falls in with a Mafia boss who engages him to help in his election campaign, then introduces him to men who might further his search for Misha, said to be in a private zoo in Chechnya. What ensues is for Viktor both a quest and an odyssey of atonement, and, for the reader, an experience as rich, topical and illuminating as Death and the Penguin.</p><p>In this sequel to the acclaimed <b>Death and the Penguin</b>, Viktor searches for Misha in what for him is both a quest and an odyssey of atonement; for the reader, it is a rich, topical and black humouredly illuminating experience.Andrey Kurkov, born in St Petersburg in 1961, now lives in Kiev.

The text is very user-friendly: casual writing style, logical presentation of material, balance of theoretical and practical, entertaining information, and lots of ideas and activities to put what you learn to use right away. The first chapter gives you the basics such as how to define language, new ways to look at grammar, your innate knowledge about language. Later chapters address core linguistics areas in depth (phonetics and phonology, morphology, syntax, and semantics). Many innovative and varied activities help you review and practice the content and apply the knowledge immediately. Special features throughout the book demystify common curiosities about how language works.</p><p>Kristin Denham is an associate professor at Western Washington University in Bellingham; she earned a Ph.D. at the University of Washington.

Their projects often involve research into the visual aspects of historical settings and characters. Christina is a theater set and costume designer and contributed advice on the period clothing for the illustrations.<br><br>Scott created these drawings in scratchboard � an engraving medium which evokes the look of popular art from the period of these stories. Scratchboard is an illustration board with a specifically prepared surface of hard white chalk. A thin layer of black ink is rolled over the surface, and lines are drawn by hand with a sharp knife by scraping through the ink layer to expose the white surface underneath. The finished drawings are then scanned and the color is added digitally.<br><br>Every child loves a story about a horse, and Black Beauty remains one of the finest, most touching ever written. Set in Victorian London, the novel follows the shifting fortunes of a horse as he moves from owner to owner. Narrated by the noble Black Beauty himself, the tale offers an animal&#x2019;s perspective of the world, and highlights the thoughtless, even cruel treatment animals endured during that period.<br></p><p>"A horse is a horse of course unless of course the horse is Black Beauty. Animal-loving children have been devoted to Black Beauty throughout this century, and no doubt will continue through the next. Although Anna Sewell's classic paints a clear picture of turn-of-the-century London, its message is universal and timeless: animals will serve humans well if they are treated with consideration and kindness.<p>Black Beauty tells the story of the horse's own long and varied life, from a well-born colt in a pleasant meadow to an elegant carriage horse for a gentleman to a painfully overworked cab horse. Throughout, Sewell rails--in a gentle, 19th-century way--against animal maltreatment. Young readers will follow Black Beauty's fortunes, good and bad, with gentle masters as well as cruel. Children can easily make the leap from horse-human relationships to human-human relationships, and begin to understand how their own consideration of others may be a benefit to all. (Ages 9 to 12)"</p>Black Beauty's tale, as told by himself, is the fascinating story of the life of a horse a hundred years ago, when horseswere a part of everyone's life.<p></p><p>Although his colthood and early life were happy, Black Beauty tastes the bitterness of cruel grooms and indifferent masters as he passes from hand to hand, progressing from the country to London and back again.</p><p></p><p>This, the most famous horse story ever written, is a must on everyone's reading list.</p></p><h2>The Art of Bible Translation</h2><p><p><b>An award-winning biblical translator reflects on the art of capturing the literary power of the Bible in English</b></p><p>In this brief book, award-winning biblical translator and acclaimed literary critic Robert Alter offers a personal and passionate account of what he learned about the art of Bible translation over the two decades he spent completing his own English version of the Hebrew Bible.</p><p>Alter&#x2019;s literary training gave him the advantage of seeing that a translation of the Bible can convey the text&#x2019;s meaning only by trying to capture the powerful and subtle literary style of the biblical Hebrew, something the modern English versions don&#x2019;t do justice to. The Bible&#x2019;s style, Alter writes, &#x201c;is not some sort of aesthetic embellishment of the &#x2018;message&#x2019; of Scripture but the vital medium through which the biblical vision of God, human nature, history, politics, society, and moral value is conveyed.&#x201d; And, as the translators of the King James Version knew, the authority of the Bible is inseparable from its literary authority.</p><p>For these reasons, the Bible can be brought to life in English only by re-creating its literary virtuosity, and Alter discusses the principal aspects of style in the Hebrew Bible that any translator should try to reproduce: word choice, syntax, word play and sound play, rhythm, and dialogue. In the process, he provides an illuminating and accessible introduction to biblical style that also offers insights about the art of translation far beyond the Bible.</p></p><p><b>Robert Alter</b> is professor of the Graduate School and emeritus professor of Hebrew and comparative literature at the University of California, Berkeley.

Watts offers a new history of the fall of the Roman Republic that explains why Rome exchanged freedom for autocracy. For centuries, even as Rome grew into the Mediterranean's premier military and political power, its governing institutions, parliamentary rules, and political customs successfully fostered negotiation and compromise. By the 130s BC, however, Rome's leaders increasingly used these same tools to cynically pursue individual gain and obstruct their opponents. As the center decayed and dysfunction grew, arguments between politicians gave way to political violence in the streets. The stage was set for destructive civil wars--and ultimately the imperial reign of Augustus. <br> The death of Rome's Republic was not inevitable. In <i>Mortal Republic</i>, Watts shows it died because it was allowed to, from thousands of small wounds inflicted by Romans who assumed that it would last forever. <br><br></p><p><b>Edward J. Watts</b> holds the Alkiviadis Vassiliadis endowed Chair and is professor of history at the University of California, San Diego. The author and editor of several prize-winning books, including <i>The Final Pagan Generation, </i>he lives in Carlsbad, California.<b></b>"[An] incisive history...Watts describes how the rise of an economic �lite and increasing inequality brought about populist sentiment that was easily exploited by nefarious politicians. The parallels to the present day are striking."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>New Yorker</b></i></i></b><br><br>"If the central analogy that animates Mortal Republic is correct, the current challenge to America's political system is likely to persist long after its present occupant has left the White House."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Times Book Review</i> (Editor's Choice)</b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Mortal Republic</i> provides excellent insights into how the Republic became the Empire, and more broadly it speaks to the ever-present threat of centralized power. The more a civilization centralizes, the more powerful a central government becomes."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Journal of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Watts chronicles the ways the republic, with a population once devoted to national service and personal honor, was torn to shreds by growing wealth inequality, partisan gridlock, political violence and pandering politicians, and argues that the people of Rome chose to let their democracy die by not protecting their political institutions, eventually turning to the perceived stability of an emperor instead of facing the continued violence of an unstable and degraded republic."&#x2015;<b><i><i><b>Smithsonian</b></i></i></b><br><br>"Readers will find many parallels to today's fraught political environment: the powerful influence of money in politics, a 'delegitimized establishment,' and 'the emergence of a personality-driven, populist politicking.' Watts ably and accessibly...covers a lot of ground in a manner accessible to all readers, including those with little knowledge of Roman history. This well-crafted analysis makes clear the subject matter's relevance to contemporary political conversations."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Publishers Weekly</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In a timely book of ancient history, an eminent classicist looks at Rome's decline from representative government to corrupt empire.... Given that mistrust of institutions is a key ingredient in the collapse of republican rule, as we are witnessing daily, the lesson is pointed. An engaging, accessible history that, read between the lines, offers commentary on today's events as well as those of two millennia past."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Kirkus</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Lucid, fast-paced, and well informed. Edward Watts's history of the failure of the Roman Republic is the tale of how greed and self-interest undermined the ancient world's most successful democratic superpower and caused Rome's people to vote in a dictatorship. Beginning with Rome's confrontations with Pyrrhus and Carthage, and a relatively simple state based on reasonable equity, Watts takes us into a world of the super-rich who undermined the very system that gave them their wealth, driving it downwards into civil war and mass murder. The elective tyranny of Augustus proved to be the only answer. This is both a splendid introduction to one of the most dramatic periods of history and a book for our times."&#x2015;<b>David Potter</b>, <b><i><b>author of <i>Constantine the Emperor</i></b></i></b><br><br>"<i>Mortal Republic</i> retells the familiar story of how one of history's most famous and long-lived republics became a monarchy.

Previous histories have rarely recognized that the battle for independence was also a woman's war. The "women of the army" toiled in army hospitals, kitchens, and laundries. Civilian women were spies, fund raisers, innkeepers, suppliers of food and clothing. Recruiters, whether patriot or tory, found men more willing to join the army when their wives and daughters could be counted on to keep the farms in operation and to resist enchroachment from squatters. "I have Don as much to Carrey on the warr as maney that Sett Now at the healm of government," wrote one impoverished woman, and she was right.<br><br><i>Women of the Republic</i> is the result of a seven-year search for women's diaries, letters, and legal records. Achieving a remarkable comprehensiveness, it describes women's participation in the war, evaluates changes in their education in the late eighteenth century, describes the novels and histories women read and wrote, and analyzes their status in law and society. The rhetoric of the Revolution, full of insistence on rights and freedom in opposition to dictatorial masters, posed questions about the position of women in marriage as well as in the polity, but few of the implications of this rhetoric were recognized. How much liberty and equality for women? How much pursuit of happiness? How much justice?<br><br>When American political theory failed to define a program for the participation of women in the public arena, women themselves had to develop an ideology of female patriotism. They promoted the notion that women could guarantee the continuing health of the republic by nurturing public-spirited sons and husbands. This limited ideology of "Republican Motherhood" is a measure of the political and social conservatism of the Revolution. The subsequent history of women in America is the story of women's efforts to accomplish for themselves what the Revolution did not.<br><br></p><p>"A foundation text in women's history, <i>Women of the Republic</i> fuses innovation with centrality, clarity of style with sophistication of analysis. It demonstrates the centrality of women's history to political history, of Republican Mothers to the world the Founding Fathers thought they built alone."--Carroll Smith-Rosenberg, University of Michigan <br>Linda K. Kerber presents a groundbreaking analysis of the role of women during the Revolutionary Era. Drawn from the direct testimony provided by women in their letters, diaries, and legal records, Women of the Republic describes women&#39;s participation in the war, evaluates changes in their education in the late eighteenth century, and analyzes their status in law and society. It also traces the development of the ideology of &#39;Republican Motherhood, &#39; which urged women to direct their patriotism toward the nurturing of the next generation of public-spirited citizens.</p><h2>The End Of Reform: New Deal Liberalism in Recession and War</h2><p>At a time when liberalism is in disarray, this vastly illuminating book locates the origins of its crisis. Those origins, says Alan Brinkley, are paradoxically situated during the second term of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, whose New Deal had made liberalism a fixture of American politics and society. The End of Reform shows how the liberalism of the early New Deal&#x2014;which set out to repair and, if necessary, restructure America&#x2019;s economy&#x2014;gave way to its contemporary counterpart, which is less hostile to corporate capitalism and more solicitous of individual rights. Clearly and dramatically, Brinkley identifies the personalities and events responsible for this transformation while pointing to the broader trends in American society that made the politics of reform increasingly popular. It is both a major reinterpretation of the New Deal and a crucial map of the road to today&#x2019;s political landscape.</p><p>Advance comments on The End Of Reform<p>"An eloquent book that will transform our understanding of what the New Deal did and did not accomplish -- and how its fate continues to shape our politics. This is a landmark history of liberalism by the most perceptive liberal historian since Richard Hofstadter."</p><p>-- Michael Kazin, author of The Populist Persuasion</p><p>"We commonly think of today's American liberal as the ideological heir of the New Deal. But Alan Brinkley shows that contemporary liberalism, largely concerned with rights and entitlements, is actually a distant and diminished cousin of New Deal reform. Those who would rejuvenate liberalism in our time have much to learn from this superb reconstruction of our recent political past."</p><p>-- Michael J. Sandel, author of Liberalism and the Limits of Justice</p><p>"Alan Brinkley's probing, thoughtful, elegantly written analysis of what happened to liberalism in Franklin D. Roosevelt's second term and in World War II challenges readers to recast their thinking not only of the New Deal but also of the entire modern age."</p><p>-- William E. Leuchtenburg, author of Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal</p><p>In praise of Alan Brinkley's Voices Of Protest</p><p>"It is not often that we get a book as good as this one about demagogic public figures like Huey Long and Father Coughlin...a sensitive and subtle work moderated by grace and restraint."</p><p>-- C. Vann Woodward, The New York Review of Books</p><p>"This uncommonly good book helps to mark the maturation of twentieth-century American historiography."</p><p>-- David M. Kennedy, The New Republic</p>rinkley brings his magnificent skills as a writer, historian, and original thinker to bear on a fascinating story -- the transformation of New Deal liberalism from the late '(3)os to the end of World War II. No one has a finer grasp of the intellectual, social, and political currents of this transforming era than Alan Brinkley. His book is a triumph." -- Doris Kearns Goodwin<br><br>When Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Democratic party won a landslide victory in the 1936 elections, the way seemed open for the New Deal to complete the restructuring of American government it had begun in 1933. But, as Alan Brinkley makes clear, no sooner were the votes counted than the New Deal began to encounter a series of crippling political and economic problems that stalled its agenda and forced an agonizing reappraisal of the liberal ideas that had shaped it -- a reappraisal still in progress when the United States entered World War II.<br><br>The wartime experience helped complete the transformation</p><h2>Brain: The Complete Mind: How It Develops, How It Works, and How to Keep It Sharp</h2><p>Did you know that listening to music tunes up your brain?

From a consideration of the individual instruments and their technical problems the author skillfully develops his analysis of orchestration, covering his analysis of orchestration, covering instrumentation of primary and secondary melodies, part-writing, chords, and contrapuntal techniques. Finally, he discusses typical problems in orchestration together with some examples of their solutions.<br><br><em>Orchestration</em> is profusely illustrated with hundreds of musical examples and with drawings of the various musical instruments that make up the modern orchestra.</p><p>Walter Piston was Professor of Music at Harvard University.

He has extensive experience in China and has been a senior advisor on China affairs on the National Security Council. Professor Lieberthal is the author of many books on Chinese politics and a long-time teacher of the Chinese politics course at Michigan.University of Michigan political science professor Lieberthal here presents a devastating critique of Mao's rule and its disastrous legacy. In the Maoist movement's peasant-based, military path to power, he perceives the roots of many characteristics of post-1949 China--for example, the close interlocking of party and army, repeated attacks on intellectuals, and mass political campaigns. Lieberthal credits Deng Xiaoping of the late 1970s and early '80s as an innovative reformer, an improvisational genius who effected a conscious reduction in the government's control of social and economic activity. This engrossing text also provides an amazingly detailed blueprint of modern China's power elite, their propaganda and coercive systems. Lieberthal, an adviser to the State Department and the World Bank, details the clash of China's new generation of technocrats and its stagnant gerontocracy as he discusses such issues as political succession, managing the economy and limiting environmental damage. China, which now has the world's largest armed forces, will remain authoritarian in the foreseeable future, he believes, even as it makes enormous economic advances. <p></p><p>Copyright 1995 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Basic &amp; Applied Concepts of Blood Banking and Transfusion Practices</h2><p><p><b>Basic &amp; Applied Concepts of Blood Banking and Transfusion Practices, 4th Edition</b><i> </i>combines logically organized and updated content in a highly readable way that makes difficult concepts easy to understand.

Appropriate for university students and for the general reader, it teaches forms of behavior modification ranging from helping children learn necessary life skills to training pets, to solving personal behavior problems. It teaches practical "how-to" skills, including: discerning long-term effects; designing, implementing, and evaluating behavioral programs; interpreting behavioral episodes; observing and recording behaviors; and recognizing instances of reinforcement, extinction, and punishment. </p><i> </i><p><i>Behavior Modification</i> is ideal for courses in Behavior Modification, Applied Behavior Analysis, Behavior Therapy, the Psychology of Learning, and related areas; and for students and practitioners of various helping professions (such as clinical psychology, counselling, education, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychiatric nursing, psychiatry, social work, speech therapy, and sport psychology) who are concerned directly with enhancing various forms of behavior development. The material is presented in an interesting, readable format that assumes no prior knowledge of behavior modification or psychology.

He had done his military service and now came to the Russian Monastery of St Panteleimon, to embark on long years of spiritual combat lasting until his death in 1938. Although he was unlearned and ignorant in the ordinary sense, tireless inner strivings gave him authentic personal experience of Christianity identical with that of many of the early ascetic Desert Fathers. The first part of this book is a remarkable account of St Silouan&#39;s life, personality and teaching by his spiritual disciple Archimandrite Sophrony. Archimandrite Sophrony went to Mt Athos in 1925 and there at the Monastery of St Panteleimon became amanuensis to Staretz Silouan. Part two comprises the writings of Silouan, originally penciled in laborious, unformed characters on odd scraps of paper. The Lord said, &#39;Every one that is of the truth hears my voice&#39; (John 18:37). And according to Father Sophrony, &#39;these words are applicable to Staretz Silouan&#39;s notes ... [That] whoever has received from God the mind and wisdom to know him will be aware in the Staretz&#39; words of the breath of the Holy Spirit.&#39; In 1988 Staretz Silouan was placed in the canon of saints by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of the Orthodox Church.</p><p>Archimandrite Sophrony an outstanding Christian ascetic, monk, and mystic of the twentieth century studied at the Orthodox Theological Institute in Paris.

Millions of refugees were dispersed across the continent. Food and fuel were scarce. Britain was bankrupt, while Germany had been reduced to rubble. In July of 1945, Harry Truman, Winston Churchill, and Joseph Stalin gathered in a quiet suburb of Berlin to negotiate a lasting peace: a peace that would finally put an end to the conflagration that had started in 1914, a peace under which Europe could be rebuilt.<br><br>The award-winning historian Michael Neiberg brings the turbulent Potsdam conference to life, vividly capturing the delegates' personalities: Truman, trying to escape from the shadow of Franklin Roosevelt, who had died only months before; Churchill, bombastic and seemingly out of touch; Stalin, cunning and meticulous. For the first week, negotiations progressed relatively smoothly. But when the delegates took a recess for the British elections, Churchill was replaced-both as prime minster and as Britain's representative at the conference-in an unforeseen upset by Clement Attlee, a man Churchill disparagingly described as "a sheep in sheep's clothing." When the conference reconvened, the power dynamic had shifted dramatically, and the delegates struggled to find a new balance. Stalin took advantage of his strong position to demand control of Eastern Europe as recompense for the suffering experienced by the Soviet people and armies. The final resolutions of the Potsdam Conference, notably the division of Germany and the Soviet annexation of Poland, reflected the uneasy geopolitical equilibrium between East and West that would come to dominate the twentieth century.<br><br>As Neiberg expertly shows, the delegates arrived at Potsdam determined to learn from the mistakes their predecessors made in the Treaty of Versailles. But, riven by tensions and dramatic debates over how to end the most recent war, they only dimly understood that their discussions of peace were giving birth to a new global conflict.<br></p><p><b>Michael Neiberg</b> is a professor of history and the Henry L.

Ambrose, comes the definitive telling of the war in Europe, from D-Day, June 6, 1944, to the end, eleven months later, on May 7, 1945.<br><br>This authoritative narrative account is drawn by the author himself from his five acclaimed books about that conflict, most particularly from the definitive and comprehensive <i>D-Day</i> and <i>Citizen Soldiers,</i> about which the great Civil War historian James McPherson wrote, &#x201c;If there is a better book about the experience of GIs who fought in Europe during World War II, I have not read it. <i>Citizen Soldiers</i> captures the fear and exhilaration of combat, the hunger and cold and filth of the foxholes, the small intense world of the individual rifleman as well as the big picture of the European theater in a manner that grips the reader and will not let him go. No one who has not been there can understand what combat is like but Stephen Ambrose brings us closer to an understanding than any other historian has done.&#x201d;<br> <br><i>The Victors</i> also includes stories of individual battles, raids, acts of courage and suffering from <i>Pegasus Bridge,</i> an account of the first engagement of D-Day, when a detachment of British airborne troops stormed the German defense forces and paved the way for the Allied invasion; and from <i>Band of Brothers,</i> an account of an American rifle company from the 506th Parachute Infantry Regiment who fought, died, and conquered, from Utah Beach through the Bulge and on to Hitter's Eagle&#x2019;s Nest in Germany.<br> <br>Stephen Ambrose is also the author of <i>Eisenhower,</i> the greatest work on Dwight Eisenhower, and one of the editors of the Supreme Allied Commander's papers. He describes the momentous decisions about how and where the war was fought, and about the strategies and conduct of the generals and officers who led the invasion and the bloody drive across Europe to Berlin.<br> <br>But, as always with Stephen E. Ambrose, it is the ranks, the ordinary boys and men, who command his attention and his awe. <i>The Victors</i> tells their stories, how citizens became soldiers in the best army in the world. Ambrose draws on thousands of interviews and oral histories from government and private archives, from the high command&#x2014;Eisenhower, Bradley, Patton&#x2014;on down through officers and enlisted men, to re-create the last year of the Second World War when the Allied soldiers pushed the Germans out of France, chased them across Germany, and destroyed the Nazi regime.</p><p><i>The Victors</i> is like a compilation of Stephen E. Ambrose's greatest hits, drawing heavily from his biography of General Dwight D. Eisenhower and several military histories that recount the events of the Allied push across the European continent in 1944 and 1945 from the frontline trooper's perspective. The narrative is vintage Ambrose, full of engaging yet workmanlike prose that conveys the epic scope of its subject while paying careful attention to the details of the often inglorious lives of the GIs. Eisenhower looms large over this book, but it's the ordinary soldiers and their experiences who give the story real life. Readers who have already dipped into the Ambrose library may find sections of <i>The Victors</i> redundant, but for those who want an adept overview of what Ike and his men accomplished, this is a great place to start. <i>--John J. Miller</i>Stephen E. Ambrose was a renowned historian and acclaimed author of more than&nbsp;thirty books.

The struggle for freedom (the wind) within containment (the box) is the unifying motif as Hayes explores how identity is shaped by race, heritage, and spirituality.

It&#39;s a ridiculous separation says marital and sex therapist David Schnarch, who believes sex is the all-telling barometer of a love relationship. Schnarch&#39;s fundamental lesson is differentiation--the often threatening process of defining yourself as separate from your partner, which inevitably draws you closer to your partner than you ever dreamed possible. Schnarch uses dramatic therapy sessions to illustrate how differentiation doesn&#39;t just cure sexual dysfunction; it helps couples reach the mind-blowing heights of their sexual potential. A groundbreaking and truly erotic discussion of adult sexuality.As renowned sex and marital therapist David Schnarch reveals in this revolutionary book, keeping passion and intimacy alive requires facing the anxiety of defining yourself while getting closer to your partner, a process called differentiation. In his sexual crucible approach, you don&#39;t have to compromise or give up your desires; instead, you have to stand on your own, stay close to your partner, and be prepared to soothe yourself when you don&#39;t get what you want. Sexual encounters provide perfect opportunities to differentiate and develop the strength of love deeply. Mixing humor and compassion, Schnarch describes couples&#39; explicit sexual encounters and dramatic therapy sessions to demonstrate how they found personal, marital, and sexual fulfillment far greater than they ever dreamed possible. In this respectful, erotic, uplifting, and spiritual guide to sexual and emotional fulfillment, David Schnarch seeks to bring out the best in each of us, to help us love on life&#39;s terms, and to revel in invigorating adult sexuality.</p><h2>On the Clock: What Low-Wage Work Did to Me and How It Drives America Insane</h2><p><b>"<i>Nickled and Dimed </i>for the Amazon age," (Salon) the bitingly funny, eye-opening story of finding work in the automated and time-starved world of hourly low-wage labor</b><br>After the local newspaper where she worked as a reporter closed, Emily Guendelsberger took a pre-Christmas job at an Amazon fulfillment center outside Louisville, Kentucky. There, the vending machines were stocked with painkillers, and the staff turnover was dizzying. In the new year, she travelled to North Carolina to work at a call center, a place where even bathroom breaks were timed to the second. And finally, Guendelsberger was hired at a San Francisco McDonald's, narrowly escaping revenge-seeking customers who pelted her with condiments.<br><br>Across three jobs, and in three different parts of the country, Guendelsberger directly took part in the revolution changing the U.S. workplace. ON THE CLOCK takes us behind the scenes of the fastest-growing segment of the American workforce to understand the future of work in America - and its present. Until robots pack boxes, resolve billing issues, and make fast food, human beings supervised by AI will continue to get the job done. Guendelsberger shows us how workers went from being the most expensive element of production to the cheapest - and how low wage jobs have been remade to serve the ideals of efficiency, at the cost of humanity.<br><br>ON THE CLOCK explores the lengths that half of Americans will go to in order to make a living, offering not only a better understanding of the modern workplace, but also surprising solutions to make work more humane for millions of Americans.</p><p>Emily Guendelsberger has worked at <i>Philadelphia City Paper</i>, the <i>Onion's A.V.

Guendelsberger's journey 'in the weeds' of low-wage America is mordantly funny, devastating and rigorous, a broadside against the exploitation of the many by the few and a warning of how easily our sociopathic economy could all come crashing down, leaving even C-suite executives to subsist on ketchup packets and worthless stock options."&#x2015;<b><i>Jessica Bruder, author of <i>Nomadland</i>: Surviving America in the Twenty-First Century</i></b><br><br>"When former <i>Onion</i> editor Emily Guendelsberger explores how the non-college majority scrapes by, she uncovers a Darwinian hellscape where the richest man on earth munificently bestows painkillers upon his warehouse serfs, telemarketers pitch products to the newly bereaved, and the customer is always right-even when she's lobbing McNugget sauce at your head.

A single nation, they suggest, slowly emerged from the rivalries and fluctuating fortunes of separate kingdoms like Mercia, Wessex and East Anglia. Major figures such as Offa, Alfred, Edgar and Cnut are discussed in detail, while the stunning illustrations convey the immense achievements of Anglo-Saxon centuries were 'simply a barbarous prelude to better things'.</p><p></p><h2>The Global Age: Europe 1950-2017 (The Penguin History of Europe)</h2><p><b><b>The final chapter in the Penguin History of Europe series from the acclaimed scholar and author of </b><b><i>To Hell and Back</i></b></b><br><br>After the overwhelming horrors of the first half of the twentieth century, described by Ian Kershaw in his previous book as being 'to Hell and back,' the years from 1950 to 2017 brought peace and relative prosperity to most of Europe.

It was the beginning of a completely changed era in the continent&#x2019;s history, one of unprecedented insecurity. It was an era intrinsically shaped by the division that the war had left as its overriding legacy &#x2013; and by the appalling threat of nuclear annihilation.<br><br> For more than four decades the Cold War was to drive the two halves of Europe apart. The largely separate development took place, however, with one vital feature in common: the primacy of military power. This military power, the dominant feature of post-war Europe on both sides of the Iron Curtain, was now controlled by only two countries: the United States of America and the Soviet Union. Both were preoccupied with security. Both were determined to prevent the enemy dominating Europe. The novelty in their tense relationship was that it rested ultim- ately on weaponry of such fearful destructiveness that neither side dared use it. Within the space of only a few years it became the power of com- plete destruction. Both the United States and the Soviet Union &#x2013; one already a superpower, the other on the verge of becoming one &#x2013; had built atomic bombs by 1949. Four years later both the USA and the USSR had acquired the immensely more powerful hydrogen bombs and were soon in possession of nuclear arsenals capable of destroying civilized life on the planet several times over. <br><br> During the years 1950 to 1962 the Cold War was at its most intense, and most dangerous. For much of this period Europe was the centre of the Cold War &#x2013; though in a nuclear age superpower confrontation anywhere on the globe could have had the direst repercussions for the European continent.<br> &nbsp;<br><br> THE HEAT OF THE COLD WAR<br>The emerging conflict between the United States and the Soviet Union in the immediate post-war years had been threatening at times but had avoided disaster. No sooner had the new decade begun, however, than a dangerous crisis threatened to have grave consequences. That the crisis erupted over distant Korea was the most obvious indicator that Europe could not avoid being part of a global conflict between the superpowers. Whereas before 1945 the United States had been reluctantly drawn into European affairs to fight intwo world wars, Western Europe now became in essence an appendage &#x2013; if an important one &#x2013; of American foreign policy. Meanwhile the eastern bloc (apart from Yugoslavia, which had in the aftermath of the war successfully asserted its independence from Moscow) was even more directly committed to support of the USSR in its worldwide confrontation with the USA.<br><br> Korea had been annexed by the Japanese in 1910 and ruled by them until the end of the Second World War. The Korean peninsula was then divided more or less in half at a demarcation line on the 38th parallel by an agreement between the Americans and Soviets to split the administra- tion of the country temporarily. By 1948 expectations of a reunited Korea had disappeared. The division congealed into a communist republic in the north, effectively a Soviet satellite and seen by Moscow as part of the Soviet sphere of influence, and a vehemently anti-communist republic in the south, dominated by American interests. But the victory of communism in China in September 1949, after more than two decades of bitter civil war with Chiang Kai- shek&#x2019;s Nationalists (which had run alongside the immensely bloody war against the Japanese invaders between 1937 and 1945), had left the Korean peninsula exposed. The south remained a non- communist enclave in a vast region of communist dominance. When, on 25 June 1950, the North Koreans crossed the demarcation line and&nbsp;attacked the south of the partitioned country, superpower confrontation escalated dangerously. The United States, committed to the containment of Soviet power and highly allergic to the prospects of further expansion of communism, in Southeast Asia as well as in Europe, could not con- template the loss of South Korea and the evident threat that Japan would then face.<br><br>The Americans correctly presumed that the North Koreans would not have attacked without Stalin&#x2019;s authorization. The Soviet dictator had, in fact, given a green light some weeks earlier, though he was unwilling to send combat forces, looking to the Chinese to provide military assis- tance, if necessary. The American leadership took the view that communist expansion had to be halted there and then if a domino effect were to be prevented. If the fall of Korea were not arrested, argued President Harry Truman, then the Soviets would &#x2018;swallow up one piece of Asia after another&#x2019;. And &#x2018;if we were to let Asia go, the Near East would collapse and [there was] no telling what would happen in Europe&#x2019;. Not for the last time in post-war Europe, the failed appeasement policy of the 1930s was cited as a motive for military action. The appeasers had failed to stop Hitler. If the communist advance were not now stopped in its tracks, it would lead to a third world war.<br><br> The United States gained the backing of the United Nations, estab- lished in October 1945, to use force to defend a member nation under attack. This was the first time that this had happened, and it arose from a Soviet mistake. Both Stalin and the United States leadership were satisfied, when it was agreed at the Yalta Conference in February 1945 to create the United Nations Organization, that they would have the right of veto in any vote in the envisaged Security Council, whose five perman- ent members would also include Britain, France and China. Through a Security Council controlled by the great powers, it was imagined that the United Nations would prove far more effective than the League of Nations had been. The fallacy of such a presumption was to be repeatedly demonstrated during the Cold War when the use of the veto by one or the other superpower almost invariably produced stalemate on the Security Council. The exception was in 1950 when a temporary Soviet boycott of the Security Council in protest at the refusal to give a seat to Communist China enabled approval for the aid necessary to repel the invasion of South Korea and to re-establish peace and security. Stalin quickly realized his error and the Soviets again took their seat on the Security Council. But it was too late to stop a United Nations Command force, dominated by the USA, being sent to support the South Korean military. By the time the war ended the United Nations Command, which had incorporated the South Koreans, totalled almost 933,000 troops. The overwhelming majority of them were South Koreans (591,000) and Americans (302,000). A number of European countries &#x2013; Britain and, with far smaller contingents, France, Belgium, Greece and the Nether- lands, along with a tiny contribution from Luxembourg &#x2013; sent combat troops.<br><br> The Americans took the initiative throughout, expelling the North Koreans from the south, then pushing on beyond the demarcation line and into the north. Fearful of outright hostilities with the United States, Stalin rejected North Korean requests for Soviet intervention. The Chinese leader, Mao Zedong, however, was not prepared to see Korea fall wholly under American control, perhaps offering a gateway to an attack on a future date on China itself (whose relations with the Soviet Union were already less than harmonious). In autumn 1950 Mao had dispatched a sizeable force, eventually numbering about 300,000 troops, and forced the US Eighth Army into panicky retreat. It was a first indication that the West would have to reckon with China as a major military power. Within two months, the whole of North Korea was again under communist control and the South Korean capital, Seoul, had fallen. An alarmed Washington considered dropping an atomic bomb.<br><br> The United States still possessed a huge supremacy &#x2013; 74 to 1, according to some estimates &#x2013; in operational atomic bombs, compared with the Soviet Union. But what, exactly, would be the targets? In a war fought overwhelmingly in the Korean countryside, this was not obvious. And the prospects of a massive retaliatory escalation of what was a regional war, possibly extending to a Soviet invasion of Western Europe, or even atomic bombs dropped on European cities, had to be contemplated. Towards the end of 1950 the prospect of the widening of the conflict lead- ing to a third world war was a very real one. The American military leadership had drawn up a list of Russian and Chinese cities as targets and considered delivering an ultimatum to China to retreat beyond the Yalu river. If necessary there would be a resort to &#x2018;prompt use of the atomic bomb&#x2019;.<br> &nbsp;<br> Wiser counsels prevailed. And by spring 1951, by which time the Chinese offensive had been blocked with much bloodshed, the Americans had regained the initiative, and the UN Command troops had eventually forced back the communist army. For the next two years both sides remained mired in a horrible war of attrition. In the armistice con- cluded in July 1953 the Korean War ended much as it had started, with each side behind the demarcation line at the 38th parallel. The three-year bitter war had cost the lives of nearly three million dead and wounded &#x2013; the vast majority of them Koreans from both sides of the divide. American casualties numbered almost 170,000, over 50,000 dead, and those of the European contingents over 8,000, the majority of them British.<br><br> Although far away and not primarily involving Europeans, the Korean War had significant consequences for Europe, resulting from the dram- atic rise in American defence expenditure. The first test explosion of a Soviet atomic bomb in August 1949, before the Korean War, at the Semi- palatinsk test site in modern-day Kazakhstan, had already concentrated American minds on the need to advance the development of nuclear technology to keep ahead of the Soviets. President Truman had commissioned not just the accelerated production of atomic bombs but also, on 31 Jan- uary 1950, the building of a &#x2018;super-bomb&#x2019;. Military spending was already set to escalate by the time the outbreak of the Korean War sent it soaring. Within a year the US defence budget more than quadrupled. By 1952 military expenditure was consuming little short of one-fifth of American gross domestic product, up from less than a twentieth only three years earlier. On 1 November that year the Americans carried out the first test of their &#x2018;super-bomb&#x2019; &#x2013; a hydrogen bomb that &#x2018;blotted out the whole horizon&#x2019; and obliterated the Pacific island (Eniwetok Atoll) where the explosion had taken place. Only nine months later, on 12 August 1953, the Soviets followed suit with their own test in a Central Asian desert. Winston Churchill later aptly spoke of a &#x2018;new terror&#x2019; that brought &#x2018;equal- ity in annihilation&#x2019;.<br><br> Unsurprisingly, the Americans felt obliged to review not just their expenditure but also their overseas commitments in the light of a policy of global containment of a Soviet threat that was perceived to be a rap- idly growing menace. This obviously affected Europe. The Americans thought increasingly of aid to Europe in military terms. The Marshall Plan, established in 1947 to stimulate European economic recovery after the war through the provision of around $13 million over four years, was wound down. But by the end of 1951 American military aid to Europe had amounted to almost $5 billion. By 1952, as the build-up of arms increased in the wake of the Korean War, up to 80 per cent of American aid to Western Europe was directed at military purposes rather than civilian reconstruction.<br><br> In April 1949 the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) had been established as a pact that bound, initially, twelve countries &#x2013; the United States, Canada, Britain, France, Italy, Denmark, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Portugal and Iceland (extended in 1952 to include Greece and Turkey) &#x2013; to the defence of Western Europe. But it was plain to American leaders from the start that NATO&#x2019;s armed strength was inadequate. And they felt European countries needed to contribute more to their own defence costs; that the United States, starting to see itself as the world&#x2019;s policeman, could not continue to carry a hugely disproportionate burden of European defence. Each of NATO&#x2019;s European partners accordingly increased defence expenditure. West Germany, prohibited from the manufacture of arms but producing military machinery, tools and vehicles in ever greater numbers, benefited greatly from the demand for steel, increasing output by over 60 per cent between 1949 and 1953 &#x2013; a boost to its burgeoning &#x2018;economic miracle&#x2019;. Expenditure had to be turned into military strength. So at a NATO meeting in Lisbon in 1952, members determined to raise at least ninety- six new divisions within two years.<br><br> However, the elephant in the room could not be ignored for much longer. Strengthening NATO could make little progress without the rearming of West Germany. Such a short time after it had taken a mighty alliance to crush Germany&#x2019;s military power, once and for all it was thought, the prospect of a resurgent German militarism not surprisingly held scant appeal for her European neighbours (as well, understandably, as terrifying the Soviets). The Americans had raised the question of West German rearmament already in 1950, not long after the outbreak of the Korean War. They continued to press, and Western European NATO partners had to acknowledge that there was logic in their case. Why should the Americans continue to foot the lion&#x2019;s share of the bill for the defence of Europe if the Europeans were prepared to do so little? From the European point of view, there was always the lingering fear that the United States might even retreat from Europe, as it had done after 1918 and had initially been envisaged following the end of the Second World War. And there was also the need to ensure that West Germany remained bound to the Western alliance, something that Stalin was prepared to test with an overture in 1952 &#x2013; rejected outright by Western leaders &#x2013; that dangled before German eyes the inducement of a unified, neutral Germany. Stalin&#x2019;s initiative was interpreted in the West as an attempt to press the Americans to leave Europe. It also plainly aimed to head off the closer incorporation of the Federal Republic in the Western alliance (which the West German government, under its Chancellor, Konrad Adenauer, was keen&nbsp; to&nbsp; attain).&nbsp; This was by now closely bound up with the question of a West German armed force.<br><br> Already in 1950 a proposal that appeared to offer a potential break- through in the conundrum of how to make West Germany a military power while not alienating European countries vehemently opposed to such a step had, surprisingly perhaps, come from the French. The French proposal, advanced in October 1950 by the Prime Minister Ren� Pleven, was intended to avoid the accession of West Germany to NATO, the step sought by the Americans, by the formation of a European defence organization th...</p><h2>Standard Bridge Bidding for the 21st Century</h2><p>..an easy recommendation for all but experts as the new 2/1 reference manual.

It begins with a curious geometric pattern that inspires two theoretical physicists to propose a radically new type of matter&#x2014;one that raises the possibility of new materials with never before seen properties, but that violates laws set in stone for centuries.

He is the author of&nbsp;<i>The Second Kind of Impossible</i>, and the coauthor of&nbsp;<i>Endless Universe</i>&nbsp;with Neil Turok, which describes the two competing ideas in cosmology to which he contributed. With his student, Dov Levine, Steinhardt first invented the theoretical concept of quasicrystals before they were synthesized in a laboratory. More than three decades later, with Luca Bindi, he guided the team that led to the discovery of three different natural quasicrystals in the Kamchatka Peninsula. In 2014, the International Mineralogical Association named a new mineral &#x201c;steinhardtite&#x201d; in his honor.The Second Kind of Impossible<br><br> PREFACE<br> MIDDLE OF NOWHERE, KAMCHATKA PENINSULA, JULY 22, 2011:<br><br> I held my breath as the blue behemoth lurched its way down the steep incline. It was my first day in the mad contraption, a weird-looking vehicle with what looked like a Russian army tank on bottom and a beat-up moving van on top.<br><br> To my amazement, our driver, Viktor, managed to make it all the way down the hill without toppling over. He hit the brakes, and our truck shuddered and shook to a halt at the edge of a riverbed. He turned off the ignition, and muttered a few words in Russian.<br><br> &#x201c;Viktor says this is a good place to stop,&#x201d; our translator announced.<br><br> I peered out the front window, but could not for the life of me see what was so good about it.<br><br> Climbing out of the cab, I stood atop the enormous tank treads to get a better view. It was a cool summer evening, approaching midnight. But it was still light out, a reminder of how far I was from home. The summer sky never gets very dark so close to the Arctic Circle. The earthy, pungent smell of decaying vegetation filled the air, the unmistakable smell of the Kamchatka tundra.<br><br> I jumped off the tank treads into the thick, spongy muck to stretch my legs when, suddenly, I was attacked from all sides. Millions and millions of ravenous mosquitoes were springing up from the muck, drawn to the carbon dioxide I was exhaling. I swiped frantically with my arms and turned this way and that to escape them. Nothing helped. I had been warned about the tundra and its perils. Bears, insect swarms, unpredictable storms, endless miles of muddy swells and ruts. But these weren&#x2019;t just stories anymore. This had become all too real.<br><br> My critics were right, I realized. I had no business leading this expedition. I was neither a geologist nor an outdoorsman. I was a theoretical physicist who belonged back home in Princeton. I should be working on calculations, with notebook in hand, not trying to lead a team of Russian, Italian, and American scientists on what was probably a hopeless quest in search of a rare mineral that had traveled billions of years through space.<br><br> How could this have happened? I asked, as I struggled against the ever-growing swarm. Unfortunately, I knew the answer: The crazy expedition had been my idea, the fulfillment of a scientific fantasy that had been occupying my mind for nearly three decades. The seed was planted in the early 1980s when my student and I developed a theory showing how to create novel forms of matter long thought to be &#x201c;impossible,&#x201d; atomic formations explicitly forbidden by venerable scientific principles.<br><br> I had learned early on to pay close attention whenever an idea is dismissed as &#x201c;impossible.&#x201d; Most of the time, scientists are referring to something that is truly out of the question, like violating the conservation of energy or creating a perpetual motion machine. It never makes sense to pursue those kinds of ideas. But sometimes, an idea is judged to be &#x201c;impossible&#x201d; based on assumptions that could be violated under certain circumstances that have never been considered before. I call that the second kind of impossible.<br> &nbsp;<br> If one can expose the underlying assumptions and find a long-overlooked loophole, the second kind of impossible is a potential gold mine that can offer a scientist the rare opportunity, perhaps a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, to make a transformational discovery.<br><br> In the early 1980s, my student and I discovered a scientific loophole in one of the most well-established laws of science and, exploiting that, realized it was possible to create new forms of matter. In a remarkable coincidence, just as our theory was being developed, an example of the material was accidentally discovered in a nearby laboratory. And soon, a new field of science was born.<br><br> But there was one question that kept bothering me: Why hadn&#x2019;t this discovery been made long ago? Surely nature had made these forms of matter thousands, or millions, or perhaps even billions of years before we had dreamed them up. I could not stop myself from wondering where the natural versions of our material were being hidden and what secrets they might hold.<br><br> I did not realize at the time that this question would lead me down the road to Kamchatka, an almost thirty-year-long detective story with a dizzying array of improbable twists and turns along the way. So many seemingly insurmountable barriers had to be conquered that it sometimes felt like an unseen force was guiding me and my team step by step toward this exotic land. Our entire investigation had been so . . . impossible.<br><br> Now we were in the middle of nowhere, with everything we had achieved up to this point at risk. Success would depend on whether we were lucky enough and skillful enough to conquer all of the unexpected obstacles, some of them terrifying, that we were about to confront.</p><h2>What the Heart Knows: Chants, Charms, and Blessings</h2><p><i>What the Heart Knows: Chants, Charms, and Blessings&nbsp;</i>is&nbsp;a&nbsp;collection of poems to provide comfort, courage, and humor at difficult or daunting moments&nbsp;in life.&nbsp;It conjures forth laments, spells, invocations, chants, blessings, promises, songs, and charms.

In 8th century Baghdad, Arab discoveries augmented Greek learning. Exchange within the thriving Muslim world brought that knowledge to Cordoba, Spain. Toledo became a famous center of translation from Arabic into Latin, a portal through which Greek and Arab ideas reached Western Europe. Salerno, on the Italian coast, was the great center of medical studies, and Sicily, ancient colony of the Greeks, was one of the few places in the West to retain contact with Greek culture and language.

She received a PhD in intellectual history from Edinburgh University, where she wrote her dissertation on the library of a sixteenth century scholar. She has written three pop reference books for the publishing arm of the Bodleian Library. <i>The Map of Knowledge</i> is her first narrative history.<b>Preface</b><br><br>In early 1509, the young artist Raffaello Sanzio (1483&#x2013;1520) began painting a series of frescoes on the walls of Pope Julius II&#x2019;s private library, deep inside the Vatican. Next door, in the Sistine Chapel, Raphael&#x2019;s great rival, Michelangelo, lay on his back on a huge scaf�fold, hundreds of feet in the air, painting onto the ceiling a monu�mental image of God giving life to Adam. The Renaissance was in full swing in Rome and, under the patronage of Pope Julius, the great city was being returned to the glory of its ancient imperial past. Raphael&#x2019;s frescoes on the four walls of the Stanza della Segna�tura illustrated the four categories of books that were shelved below them: theology, philosophy, law and poetry. In the philosophy fresco, which we now call <i>The School of Athens</i>, Raphael painted three huge vaulted arches receding into the distance, with statues of the Roman gods Minerva and Apollo on either side and broad marble steps leading down to a geometrically tiled floor. The architecture is decidedly Roman&#x2014;bold, imperious, monumental&#x2014;but the culture and ideas represented by the fifty-eight figures carefully grouped across the painting are emphatically and almost without exception Greek; it is a celebration of the rediscovery of ancient ideas that were central to the intellectual milieu of sixteenth-century Rome. Plato and Aristotle stand in the very centre, under a huge arch, silhouetted against the blue sky, which Plato points up to, while Aristotle ges�tures to the earth below him, neatly representing their philosophical tendencies&#x2014;the former&#x2019;s preoccupation with the ideal and the heavenly, the latter&#x2019;s determination to understand the physical world around him. The full scope of ancient philosophy as inherited by Italian humanism is triumphantly rendered in glowing colour.<br><br> No one knows exactly who all the other figures in the fresco are, and arguments over their identities have kept scholars occupied for centuries. Most people agree that the bald man in the front right, busy demonstrating geometrical theory with a compass, is Euclid, while the crowned man next to him, holding a globe, is certainly Ptolemy, who at this point was far more famous for his work on geography than astronomy.* All the figures identified lived in the ancient world, at least a thousand years before Raphael began paint�ing the fresco&#x2014;except for one. On the left of the painting, a man wearing a turban is leaning over Pythagoras&#x2019; shoulder to see what he is writing. He is the Muslim philosopher Averroes (1126&#x2013;1198)&#x2014;the single identifiable representative of the thousand years between the last of the ancient Greek philosophers and Raphael&#x2019;s own time, and the single representative of the vital, vibrant tradition of Arab scholarship that had flourished in this period. These scholars, who were of various faiths and origins, but were united by the fact that they wrote in Arabic, had kept the flame of Greek science burning, combining it with other traditions and transforming it with their own hard work and brilliance&#x2014;ensuring its survival and transmis�sion down through the centuries to the Renaissance.<br><br> I studied Classics and history throughout my time at school and university, but at no point was I taught about the influence of the medieval Arab world, or indeed any other external civilization, on European culture. The narrative for the history of science seemed to say, &#x201c;There were the Greeks, and then the Romans, and then there was the Renaissance,&#x201d; glibly skipping over the millennium in between. I knew from my medieval-history courses that there wasn&#x2019;t much scientific knowledge in Western Europe in this period, and I began to wonder what had happened to the books on mathemat�ics, astronomy and medicine from the ancient world. How did they survive? Who recopied and translated them? Where were the safe havens that ensured their preservation?<br><br> When I was twenty-one, a friend and I drove from England to Sicily in her old Volvo. We were researching Graeco-Roman tem�ples for our third-year dissertations. It was a great adventure. We got lost in Naples, hot in Rome, we were pulled over by the police and asked out on a date, we gaped at Pompeii and ate milky balls of buffalo mozzarella in Paestum, and finally, after weeks on the road and a short ferry trip across the Straits of Messina, we arrived in Sicily. The island immediately felt different from the rest of Italy: exotic, complicated, compelling. Its layers of history enveloped us; the marks left by succeeding civilizations, like strata in a rock face, were striking. In Syracuse Cathedral, we saw the columns of the original Greek Temple of Athena, built in the fifth century bc, still standing 2,500 years after they were erected. We learned how the cathedral had been converted into a mosque in 878, when the city came under Muslim control, and how it became a Christian church again two centuries later, when the Normans took power. It was clear that Sicily had been a meeting point for cultures over hun�dreds of years, a place where ideas, traditions and words had been exchanged and transformed, where worlds had collided. The focus of our trip was the relationship between Greek and Roman religion and architecture, but the contribution of later cultures&#x2014;Byzantine, Islamic, Norman&#x2014;was remarkable. I began to wonder about other places that had played a similar role in the history of ideas, and how those places had developed.<br><br> These questions resurfaced when I was researching my PhD on intellectual knowledge in early modern England, viewed through the library of Dr. John Dee (the man Elizabeth I called her philosopher). A strange and captivating character, Dee was my constant companion for several years. He took me on an unforgettable journey through the intellectual world of the late sixteenth century. During his extraordinary career, he amassed the first truly universal collec�tion of books in England, helped plan voyages of discovery to the New World, initiated the concept of a British Empire, reformed the calendar, searched for the philosopher&#x2019;s stone, attempted to conjure angels and travelled all over Europe with his wife, servants, several children and hundreds of books in tow. He also wrote extensively on a wide range of subjects: history, mathematics, astrology, navigation, alchemy and magic. One of his most significant achievements was helping to produce the first English translation of Euclid&#x2019;s <i>Elements</i>, in 1570. But where had this text been and who had looked after it in the 2,000 years between Euclid writing it in Alexandria and Dee publishing it in London? Studying the catalogue Dee made of his library in 1583, I noticed that a great many of his books, especially those that touched on scientific subjects, were written by Arab schol�ars. This tied in with the things I had seen in Sicily and gave me a taste of what had been going on in the Islamic world in the Middle Ages, expanding my view of history beyond the traditional Western scheme. I began to realize that the history of ideas is not constrained by boundaries of culture, religion or politics, and that, in order to fully appreciate it, a more far-reaching approach is necessary.<br><br> These ideas remained at the back of my mind, gradually crys�tallizing into a plan for a book that would follow ancient scientific ideas on their journey through the Middle Ages. As it is an enormous subject, I decided to concentrate on a few specific texts and plot their progress as they passed through the major centres of learn�ing. With my focus on the history of science and, more precisely, &#x201c;the exact sciences,&#x201d; three subjects were clearly delineated: mathematics, astronomy and medicine. Within them, three geniuses stand out: in mathematics, Euclid; in astronomy, Ptolemy and, in medicine, Galen. Euclid and Ptolemy both wrote comprehensive surveys of their subjects&#x2014;<i>The Elements </i>and <i>The Almagest</i>&#x2014;but Galen was a more complex proposition. He wrote hundreds of texts, so I decided to concentrate on those that formed the medical curriculum in Alexan�dria, in addition to the general areas of anatomy and pharmacology. All three of these remarkable men defined the structure and con�tent of their individual subjects. They created the framework within which future scholars would work for hundreds of years. Many of the theories of Ptolemy and Galen have since been disproved and replaced, but their influence and legacy is incontrovertible. Galen&#x2019;s theory of the humours still survives in traditional Tibetan medicine and also in modern complementary medicine. Ptolemy&#x2019;s survey of the fixed stars endured, as did his &#x201c;idea that the physical world is dependable and can be understood with mathematics.&#x201d;<br><br> In contrast, Euclid&#x2019;s <i>Elements </i>has stood the test of time, almost in its entirety. It was still being taught in classrooms in the twen�tieth century, and the geometrical theories it contains remain as true and relevant today as they were in the fourth century bc. The same applies to Euclid&#x2019;s demonstrative method, which uses a con�cise technical vocabulary, suppositions and proofs (diagrams), and which has remained a template for scientific writing ever since. Euclid, Galen and Ptolemy pioneered the practice of science based on observation, experimentation, accuracy, intellectual rigour and clear communication&#x2014;the cornerstones of what is now known as &#x201c;scientific method.&#x201d;<br><br> When I began to research in earnest, I was surprised how neatly the story unfolded in front of me. The year 500 was an obvious moment to begin&#x2014; a time when the intellectual traditions of antiquity were evolving into those of the Middle Ages, when scholarship was entering a different era. Subsequent chapters each centre on a different city, first of all doubling back to Alexandria to see when and how the texts were written. From here, they were dispersed across the Eastern Mediterranean to Syria and Constantinople, where they remained until the ninth century, when scholars from the new city of Baghdad, capital of the vast Muslim Empire, began seeking them out to translate them into Arabic and use the ideas contained in them as the foundation for their own scientific discoveries. Bagh�dad was the first true centre of learning since antiquity, and over time it inspired cities across the Arab world to build libraries and fund science. The most important of these was C�rdoba, in southern Spain, ruled over by the Umayyad dynasty, under whose patronage the works of Euclid, Ptolemy and Galen were studied and where their ideas were questioned and improved upon by generations of scholars. From C�rdoba, they were taken to other cities in Spain and, when the Christians began to reconquer the peninsula, Toledo became an important centre of translation and the place where they entered the Latin, Christian world.<br><br> This was the major route the texts took, but there were other places in the Middle Ages where ancient Greek, Arabic and Western culture collided. Salerno, in Southern Italy, was a place where medi�cal texts (in Arabic, but derived from Galen) were taken from North Africa and translated into Latin, and, as a result, Salerno became the centre of European medical studies for centuries, playing a vital role in the dissemination of medicine. Then, in Palermo, Ptolemy and Euclid take centre stage from Galen, as scholars translated cop�ies of <i>The Elements </i>and <i>The Almagest </i>directly from Greek to Latin, bypassing the Arabic versions in the hope of achieving greater accu�racy. The three divergent strands came together in Venice, where manuscripts began to arrive in the last half of the fifteenth century, ready to be printed for the first time.<br><br> There were, of course, other cities I could have included, but sticking to those in which copies of the key texts were studied and translated seemed the best way to avoid getting lost in this huge story. Choosing them threw up some interesting questions about what constitutes a centre of learning. Constantinople was a major repository of ancient texts, but not somewhere that science was stud�ied with any degree of originality or rigour. Nor was it a place where translation (and therefore transmission) happened on any kind of scale and, for these reasons, it only features in a supporting role&#x2014;the place to which scholars and caliphs came when searching for copies of Euclid, Ptolemy and Galen. The city on the Golden Horn might have taken over from Alexandria in terms of power and status, but it was a pale shadow when it came to scientific learning&#x2014; a centre of preservation rather than innovation. Toledo, Salerno and Palermo were the places where Arabic culture came into closest contact with Christian Europe, but there was also a degree of exchange in Syria during the Crusades. I have not discussed this in much detail, how�ever, because there is no evidence that <i>The Elements</i>, <i>The Almagest </i>or Galen&#x2019;s major works were among the books translated there.<br><br> While the underlying narrative for this story was easy to follow, finding a way through the dense, tangled undergrowth of manu�script history was not. Because they were so significant, several editions of each text were produced&#x2014;teasing out their relationship to one another and finding a clear path through was often challenging. Until the introduction of the printing press, every single text was copied out by hand, so each one was different, with its own pecu�liarities and mistakes. The study of complex textual traditions is a discipline all of its own within history, and not one to which I can claim expertise. In order to stay true to the narrative, I have had to be selective and produce simplified versions of the rich manuscript histories of these great books.<br><br> For me, the history of ideas has always been the most fascinating aspect of our past. Discovering how people approached the funda�mental questions about our planet and the universe, how they passed their theories on to future generations and expanded the frontiers of intellectual knowledge, is compelling. Much of this type of his�tory is obscured in erudite books on the shelves of research libraries, but this should not be the case. By taking a broad view and writing about the characters and stories, rather than focusing on the scientific content and historical minutiae found in academic books, it is pos�sible to bring the history of ideas to life. For example, understanding Ptolemy&#x2019;s model of the universe is above and beyond anyone with�out detailed knowledge of astronomy, but appreciating its impor�tance and following its progress is both meaningful and fascinating. Doing so takes us on a sweeping journey through the Middle Ages, zooming in on certain places at certain moments to discover exactly how and why scientific ideas were transmitted and transformed. In this way, the boundaries of the traditional Western historical narra�tive are expanded by shining a light on the profound contribution of both the Islamic world and medieval Christian scholars, filling in the millennium between &#x201c;the Romans&#x201d; and &#x201c;the Renaissance.&#x201d; This made it possible to include theories from other cultures which were gradually incorporated into the canon of mathematical, astronomical and medical thought. Ideas like the Hindu-Arabic numerals and positional notation system that came from India, via the Muslim Empire, and are used all over the world today.<br><br> When you step back and look at history from a wider angle, the intricate web of connections between different cultures comes into focus, giving us a broader, more nuanced and ultimately more vivid view of our intellectual heritage.</p><h2>Soliloquies: Augustine&#39;s Inner Dialogue (Works of Saint Augustine)</h2><p>Soliloquies is a work from Augustine&#39;s early life, shortly after his conversion, in which are visible all the seeds contained in his future writings.

Powerful and haunting, this thrilling final installment of Suzanne Collins's groundbreaking <i>The Hunger Games</i> trilogy promises to be one of the most talked about books of the year.<br> <br> <br> <p><b>A Q&amp;A with Suzanne Collins, Author of <i>Mockingjay (The Final Book of The Hunger Games)</i></b><br> </p><p></p> <b>Q:</b> You have said from the start that The Hunger Games story was intended as a trilogy. Did it actually end the way you planned it from the beginning? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Very much so. While I didn't know every detail, of course, the arc of the story from gladiator game, to revolution, to war, to the eventual outcome remained constant throughout the writing process. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> We understand you worked on the initial screenplay for a film to be based on <i>The Hunger Games</i>. What is the biggest difference between writing a novel and writing a screenplay?<p></p> <b>A:</b> There were several significant differences. Time, for starters. When you're adapting a novel into a two-hour movie you can't take everything with you. The story has to be condensed to fit the new form. Then there's the question of how best to take a book told in the first person and present tense and transform it into a satisfying dramatic experience. In the novel, you never leave Katniss for a second and are privy to all of her thoughts so you need a way to dramatize her inner world and to make it possible for other characters to exist outside of her company. Finally, there's the challenge of how to present the violence while still maintaining a PG-13 rating so that your core audience can view it. A lot of things are acceptable on a page that wouldn't be on a screen. But how certain moments are depicted will ultimately be in the director's hands. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> Are you able to consider future projects while working on <i>The Hunger Games</i>, or are you immersed in the world you are currently creating so fully that it is too difficult to think about new ideas?<p></p> <b>A:</b> I have a few seeds of ideas floating around in my head but--given that much of my focus is still on <i>The Hunger Games</i>--it will probably be awhile before one fully emerges and I can begin to develop it. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> The Hunger Games is an annual televised event in which one boy and one girl from each of the twelve districts is forced to participate in a fight-to-the-death on live TV. What do you think the appeal of reality television is--to both kids and adults? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Well, they're often set up as games and, like sporting events, there's an interest in seeing who wins. The contestants are usually unknown, which makes them relatable. Sometimes they have very talented people performing. Then there's the voyeuristic thrill&#x2014;watching people being humiliated, or brought to tears, or suffering physically--which I find very disturbing. There's also the potential for desensitizing the audience, so that when they see real tragedy playing out on, say, the news, it doesn't have the impact it should.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> If you were forced to compete in the Hunger Games, what do you think your special skill would be? <p></p> <b>A:</b> Hiding. I'd be scaling those trees like Katniss and Rue. Since I was trained in sword-fighting, I guess my best hope would be to get hold of a rapier if there was one available. But the truth is I'd probably get about a four in Training.<p></p> <b>Q:</b> What do you hope readers will come away with when they read The Hunger Games trilogy?<p></p> <b>A:</b> Questions about how elements of the books might be relevant in their own lives. And, if they're disturbing, what they might do about them. <p></p> <b>Q:</b> What were some of your favorite novels when you were a teen?<p></p> <b>A:</b> <i>A Tree Grows in Brooklyn</i> by Betty Smith <br> <i>The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter</i> by Carson McCullers <br> <i>Nineteen Eighty Four</i> by George Orwell <br> <i>Anna Karenina</i> by Leo Tolstoy <br> <i>Slaughterhouse-Five</i> by Kurt Vonnegut <br> <i>A Wrinkle in Time</i> by Madeleine L&#x2019;Engle <br> <i>Lord of the Flies</i> by William Golding <br> <i>Boris</i> by Jaapter Haar <br> <i>Germinal</i> by Emile Zola <br> <i>Dandelion Wine</i> by Ray Bradbury <br> <p>(Photo � Cap Pryor)</p> <br> <br>Suzanne Collins is the author of the groundbreaking Hunger Games trilogy for young adults: The Hunger Games, Catching Fire, and Mockingjay.

Vollmann is the author of ten novels, including <i>Europe Central</i>, which won the National Book Award.&nbsp; He has also written four collections of stories, including <i>The</i> <i>Atlas</i>, which won the PEN Center USA West Award for Fiction, a memoir, and six works of nonfiction, including <i>Rising Up and Rising Down</i> and <i>Imperial</i>, both of which were finalists for the National Book Critics Circle Award.

In short, self-contained chapters, Vollman tells the story of Jimmy the Vietnam vet, down-and-out and surviving on his disability check in a series of flophouses. Jimmy is searching for Gloria, the whore he loves, but Gloria remains elusive--indeed, she may not exist--so Jimmy, an alcoholic and general all-around troubled soul, decides to re-create Gloria himself. Each night he goes out and finds a local whore who can give him something ``to help Gloria along with a splash of light on the ocean and everything moving and rocking and shining in the sun so God help me now because Gloria is the great sea those whore-fish swim in.'' One, Nicole, may have deliberately given Jimmy AIDS; another, Melissa, gives him her childhood memories; and Dinah, whose pimp spends her money on dope, gives him a lock of hair. As Jimmy continues his search, he meets up with old friends like Phyllis the transvestite, and Code Six, a fellow vet, while, in the Tenderloin district, girls like Candy and Peggy tell him their life stories. But Jimmy, like all losers, is doomed. Gloria, according to Code Six, materializes and ``drills'' Jimmy ``right on Turk Street. That's where he got lit up.'' The terrain's been surveyed before, and Vollman's fierce writing seems often more designed to shock than to elucidate, but poor Jimmy does have some credibility, even if it at times strained. Not for the fainthearted. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Reprint. <i>PW. </i></p><p>Elizabeth Jane Howard was the author of fifteen highly acclaimed novels. The Cazalet Chronicles - The Light Years, Marking Time, Confusion, Casting Off and All Change - have become established as modern classics and have been adapted for a major BBC television series and for BBC Radio 4. In 2002 Macmillan published Elizabeth Jane Howard&#39;s autobiography, Slipstream. In that same year she was awarded a CBE in the Queen&#39;s Birthday Honours List. She died, aged ninety, at home in Suffolk on 2 January 2014.Lush, sprawling escapist fiction of the first order, the third installment of the Cazalet Chronicle opens in the spring of 1942 and continues the saga begun in The Light Years and Marking Time. Set in London and the English countryside, much of the story focuses on the eldest Cazalet cousins, Louise, Polly and Clary, as they exit their teens and take their first steps into adulthood. Former acting student Louise has been swept into a brilliant but chilly marriage to Michael Hadleigh, a glamorous portrait painter and aspiring Member of Parliament whose life is controlled by his powerful mother. Best friends Polly and Clary leave the cozy confines of the Cazalet's country home to begin what they hope will be terribly grown-up lives in London. While Polly mourns the recent death of her mother, Clary keeps a journal that she hopes to give to her father, who has been missing since the invasion of Normandy. Alternating with the cousins' stories are chapters devoted to the rest of the Cazalet clan, their friends and lovers, bringing readers up to date on the doings of adulterous Edward, his dutiful spinster sister Rachel, her loving best friend Margot Sidney and others. Howard creates a nearly palpaple world, peopled with the sort of well-conceived characters that linger long in the reader's mind. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Big Orange Splot</h2><p>Shy Mr. Plumbean introduces elephants, baobabs, onions, lemonade, and steamshovels into the life of what was once a quiet and neat street where all the houses looked the same</p><p></p><h2>Lady Knight: Book 4 of the Protector of the Small Quartet</h2><p><b><i>Protector of the Small #4<br><br></i></b>Keladry of Mindelan has finally achieved her life-long dream of being a knight. But it&#x2019;s not turning out as she imagined at all. With the land of Tortall at war with the Scanrans, she has been assigned to oversee a refugee camp. But Kel has had a vision in the Chamber&#x2014;a vision of the man behind the horrific battle machines that her fellow knights and friends are now fighting without her. She is torn between a duty she has sworn and a quest that she feels could turn the tide of the war. . .</p><p>In the final thrilling installment of Tamora Pierce's Protector of the Small series (<i> First Test</i>, <i>Page</i>, and <i>Squire</i>), our sturdy young heroine, Keladry of Mindelan (a.k.a. Kel), has finally been knighted. Never one to rest on her laurels, Kel champs at the bit, ready to tackle the horrific magic killing devices she was shown in the Chamber of the Ordeal during her knighthood initiation. The huge, insectlike machines, "made of iron-coated giants' bones, chains, pulleys, dagger-fingers and -toes, and a long whiplike tail," feed on the souls of dead children and are systematically killing off the citizens and warriors of Tortall. <p> Thoroughly disgusted to discover that not only is she not going to be assigned a combat post, but she has been placed in charge of a refugee camp instead, Kel, in her usual noble, stoic way, swallows her disappointment and sets out being the best refugee camp commander possible. Of course, destiny has a way of sneaking up on a young woman like Kel, and soon she is fulfilling the ordeal the Chamber set out for her... and then some.</p><p> Tamora Pierce once again draws her legions of fans into her story, blending humor, pathos, exhilarating battles, and gripping drama with a very real, very appealing protagonist. It's easy to make war appear black and white, a matter of good versus evil. Pierce finds the shades of gray. (Ages 12 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>In the sixth grade, Tamora Pierce was encouraged by her father to start writing and she immediately got hooked. Once she discovered fantasy and science fiction, she tried to write the same kind of stories she read, only with teenaged girl heroines who were usually missing from the 1960s stories. <br><br>Before her junior year at the University of Pennsylvania where she studied psychology, Pierce rediscovered writing when she wrote her first original short story since tenth grade. She sold her first story a year later and then enrolled in a fiction writing course during her senior year. When her teacher suggested that she tackle a novel, her childhood ideas came back to her and she began her first sword and sorcery novel. <br><br>Pierce then worked as a housemother in an Idaho group home for teenaged girls, who loved hearing Alanna&#x2019;s story from the in-progress quartet, Song of the Lioness. As Pierce continued to write and send out manuscripts, she moved to Manhattan to get her publishing career off the ground. <br><br>Pierce still lives in Manhattan with her husband, writer/filmmaker Tim, and their three cats, two parakeets, plus a floating population of rescued wildlife. She enjoys her hectic life as a full-time writer and she hopes that her books leave her readers with the feeling that they can achieve anything if they want it badly enough.<br><br>Tamora Pierce is a popular author of fantasy books for teenagers.

Now, drawing on rarely consulted archives, Frederick Crews has assembled a great volume of evidence that reveals a surprising new Freud: a man who blundered tragicomically in his dealings with patients, who in fact never cured anyone, who promoted cocaine as a miracle drug capable of curing a wide range of diseases, and who advanced his career through falsifying case histories and betraying the mentors who had helped him to rise. The legend has persisted, Crews shows, thanks to Freud&#x2019;s fictive self-invention as a master detective of the psyche, and later through a campaign of censorship and falsification conducted by his followers.</p><p>A monumental biographical study and a slashing critique, <i>Freud: The Making of an Illusion</i> will stand as the last word on one of the most significant and contested figures of the twentieth century.</p></p><p><b>Frederick Crews</b> is the author of many books, including the bestselling satire <i>The Pooh Perplex</i> and <i>Follies of the Wise</i>, which was a finalist for a National Book Critics Circle award.

Bittersweet is the idea that in all things there is both something broken and something beautiful, that there is a moment of lightness on even the darkest of nights, a shadow of hope in every heartbreak, and that rejoicing is no less rich even when it contains a splinter of sadness. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the practice of believing that we really do need both the bitter and the sweet, and that a life of nothing but sweetness rots both your teeth and your soul. Bitter is what makes us strong, what forces us to push through, what helps us earn the lines on our faces and the calluses on our hands. Sweet is nice enough, but bittersweet is beautiful, nuanced, full of depth and complexity. Bittersweet is courageous, gutsy, audacious, earthy. "This is what I&#x2019;ve come to believe about change: it&#x2019;s good, in the way that childbirth is good, and heartbreak is good, and failure is good. By that I mean that it&#x2019;s incredibly painful, exponentially more so if you fight it, and also that it has the potential to open you up, to open life up, to deliver you right into the palm of God&#x2019;s hand, which is where you wanted to be all long, except that you were too busy pushing and pulling your life into exactly what you thought it should be. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve learned the hard way that change is one of God&#x2019;s greatest gifts, and most useful tools. Change can push us, pull us, rebuke and remake us. It can show us who we&#x2019;ve become, in the worst ways, and also in the best ways. I&#x2019;ve learned that it&#x2019;s not something to run away from, as though we could, and that in many cases, change is a function of God&#x2019;s graciousness, not life&#x2019;s cruelty.&#x201d; Niequist, a keen observer of life with a lyrical voice, writes with the characteristic warmth and honesty of a dear friend: always engaging, sometimes challenging, but always with a kind heart. You will find Bittersweet savory reading, indeed. &#x201c;This is the work I&#x2019;m doing now, and the work I invite you into: when life is sweet, say thank you, and celebrate. And when life is bitter, say thank you, and grow.&#x201d;</p></p><p><p>Shauna Niequist is the author of <em>Cold Tangerines</em>, <em>Bittersweet</em>, <em>Bread &amp; Wine</em> and <em>Savor</em>. She is married to Aaron, and they have two wild and silly and darling boys, Henry and Mac. They live outside Chicago, where Aaron leads The Practice and is recording a project called A New Liturgy. Shauna also writes for the Storyline Blog, and for IF:Table, she is a member of the Relevant podcast, and a guest teacher at her church. Shauna&#x2019;s three great loves are her family, dinner parties, and books, and she believes that vulnerable storytelling, hard laughter, and cold pizza for breakfast can cure almost anything.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p>Niequist (Cold Tangerines) returns with an often humorous and always contemplative series of personal essays on bittersweet experiences, illustrating through her own life that 'rejoicing is no less rich even when it contains a splinter of sadness.' Spiritually, the book bravely sets out to decipher the paradoxically co-dependent nature of happiness and grief. But Niequist's title should not be seen as simply a convenient theological metaphor; it is also a literary device. Impressively, many of Niequist's perfectly concocted chapters weave in culinary themes, evoking the sensory, physical experience of the bittersweet along with the spiritual sense of it. When writing of deep friendship and the loss that sometimes accompanies it, her narrative often revolves around a dinner table, a cooking club, or a farmer's market. Niequist's ability to describe the sensation of eating a peppery arugula salad punctuated with sweet blueberries is just as evocative as her ability to express the intricacies of love, loss, hope, and doubt. Readers of all faiths will find this book courageous, sincere, poetic, and profound. There's nothing bitter in this sweet treat of a spiritual memoir. (July) -- Publishers Weekly, starred review (Publishers Weekly ) (<i>Publishers Weekly</i>)<br><br>Writing with another tasty theme in mind, Niequist (Cold Tangerines) sees bittersweetness as 'the idea that in all things there is both something broken and something beautiful, that there is a sliver of lightness on even the darkest of nights, a shadow of hope in every heartbreak.' In Bittersweet: Thoughts on Change, Grace, and Learning the Hard Way, she shines light in that darkness, thanks to her own journey through change and heartbreak and questions and doubt, through her struggle to find good and God in the messiness of life. Niequist and her husband faced job changes, a move and miscarriages, all rendered here in the smooth language and deep honesty that defines her style as a writer. She's honest, too, about the good things---food, friends, family. Her short essays allow a glimpse into her life, but, more importantly, her heart. Readers searching for an honest look at the bitter and sweet of life will find it here; those looking for fine writing and God in the day to day will experience that here as well. (<i>Christian Retailing</i>)<br><br>This very personal book offers a modest, gentle, and, yes, bittersweet reflection on life and life-changing moments. In a collection of interweaving essays, Niequist provides &#x201c;an ode to all things bittersweet, to life at the edges, a love letter to what change can do in us.&#x201d; To Niequist, change is a good thing even if &#x201c;incredibly painful.&#x201c; In a short period of time, she became pregnant, lost a job she loved, had a baby, and wrote a book. She didn&#x2019;t lose her faith as much as lost track of it. These short pieces capture moments when her world seemed to be spiraling out of control. Stunned by the loss of her beloved grandmother, she discovers that the best way to honor her life is to live in simplicity and kindness. Bittersweet is full of such small but important lessons of daily living, about how to live life again &#x201c;after the brokenness.&#x201d; Niequist firmly believes that it is the stories of ordinary people that can make a difference in people&#x2019;s lives. &#x201c;There is nothing small or inconsequential about our stories,&#x201d; she concludes. &#x201c;There is, in fact, nothing bigger.&#x201d; (<i>Booklist</i>)<br><br>BITTERSWEET: THOUGHTS ON CHANGE, GRACE, AND LEARNING THE HARD WAY provides an outstanding survey which maintains that to live a balanced life, we need both the bitter and the sweet. Bittersweet contains depth and complexity: it's offered in change and in recognition of spiritual gifts, and is presented here as a positive, moving force in any life.

There is nary a second to pause and linger: page after page describes the period, its defining elements of style, and its famous artisans and books and offers historical time lines and a collection of sample chairs, tables, case pieces, desks, and the like. The 3,000 photographs are superb, each with brief description, date of manufacture, dimensions, provenance (when known), occasional price (from $200 to more than $450,000), and sometimes the dealer code.

He's got plenty of work. In this version of America, slavery continues in four states called "the Hard Four." On the trail of a runaway known as Jackdaw, Victor arrives in Indianapolis knowing that something isn't right--with the case file, with his work, and with the country itself. <br> As he works to infiltrate the local cell of a abolitionist movement called the Underground Airlines, tracking Jackdaw through the back rooms of churches, empty parking garages, hotels, and medical offices, Victor believes he's hot on the trail. But his strange, increasingly uncanny pursuit is complicated by a boss who won't reveal the extraordinary stakes of Jackdaw's case, as well as by a heartbreaking young woman and her child--who may be Victor's salvation. <br> Victor believes himself to be a good man doing bad work, unwilling to give up the freedom he has worked so hard to earn. But in pursuing Jackdaw, Victor discovers secrets at the core of the country's arrangement with the Hard Four, secrets the government will preserve at any cost. <br> <i>Underground Airlines </i>is a ground-breaking novel, a wickedly imaginative thriller, and a story of an America that is more like our own than we'd like to believe.</p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of July 2016:</strong> A powerful look what might have been, Ben Winters creates an alternate reality based on the absence one of our most important historical events: The Civil War.

While Darwinian natural selection has successfully explained the evolution of much of life on earth, it has never seemed fully adequate to explain the aspects of our minds that seem most uniquely and profoundly human--art, morality, consciousness, creativity, and language. Nor has natural selection offered solutions to how the human brain evolved so quickly--in less than 2 million years--and why such a large brain remains unique to our species.<br><br>Now, in <b>The Mating Mind</b>, a pioneering work of evolutionary science, these aspects of human nature are at last explored and explained. Until fairly recently most biologists have ignored or rejected Darwin's claims for his other great theory of evolution--sexual selection through mate choice, which favors traits simply because they prove attractive to the opposite sex. But over the last two decades, biologists have taken up Darwin's insights into how the reproduction of the sexiest is as much a focus of evolution as the survival of the fittest.<br><br>In this brilliantly ambitious and provocative book, evolutionary psychologist Geoffrey Miller shows the evolutionary power of sexual choice and the reasons why our ancestors became attracted not only to pretty faces and healthy bodies, but to minds that were witty, articulate, generous, and conscious. The richness and subtlety of modern psychology help to reveal how the human mind evolved, like the peacock's tail and the elk's antlers, for courtship and mating.<br><br>Drawing on new ideas from evolutionary biology, economics, and psychology, Miller illuminates his arguments with examples ranging from natural history to popular culture, from the art of New Guinea's bowerbirds to the sexual charisma of <i>South Park</i>'s school chef. Along the way, he provides fascinating insights into the inarticulacy of teenage boys, the diversity of ancient Greek coins, the reasons why Scrooge was single, the difficulties of engaging with modern art, and the function of sumo wrestling.<br><br>Witty, powerfully argued, and continually thought-provoking, Miller's cascade of ideas bears comparison with such pivotal books as Richard Dawkins's <b>The Selfish Gene</b> and Steven Pinker's <b>The Language Instinct</b>. It is a landmark in our understanding of our own species.</p><p>Evolutionary psychology has been called the "new black" of science fashion, though at its most controversial, it more resembles the emperor's new clothes. Geoffrey Miller is one of the Young Turks trying to give the phenomenon a better spin. In <i>The Mating Mind</i>, he takes Darwin's "other" evolutionary theory--of sexual rather than natural selection--and uses it to build a theory about how the human mind has developed the sophistication of a peacock's tail to encourage sexual choice and the refining of art, morality, music, and literature.<p> Where many evolutionary psychologists see the mind as a Swiss army knife, and cognitive science sees it as a computer, Miller compares it to an entertainment system, evolved to stimulate other brains. Taking up the baton from studies such as Richard Dawkins' <i>The Selfish Gene</i>, it's a dizzyingly ambitious project, which would be impossibly vague without the ingenuity and irreverence that Miller brings to bear on it. Steeped in popular culture, the book mixes theories of runaway selection, fitness indicators, and sensory bias with explanations of why men tip more than women and how female choice shaped (quite literally) the penis. It also extols the sagacity of Mary Poppins. Indeed, Miller allows ideas to cascade at such a torrent that the steam given off can run the risk of being mistaken for hot air).</p><p> That large personalities can be as sexually enticing as oversize breasts or biceps may indeed prove comforting, but denuding sexual chemistry can be a curiously unsexy business, akin to analyzing humor. As a courting display of Miller's intellectual plumage, though, <i>The Mating Mind</i> is formidable, its agent-provocateur chest swelled with ideas and articulate conjecture. While occasionally his magpie instinct may loot fool's gold, overall it provides an accessible and attractive insight into modern Darwinism and the survival of the sexiest. <i>--David Vincent, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>Follow me on twitter @matingmind</p><h2>Picture Me with My Grandma</h2><p>Book by McCafferty, Catherine</p><p></p><h2>Frost: A Novel (Vintage International)</h2><p>Thomas Bernhard combined a searing wit and an unwavering gaze into the human condition. His debut novel, <i>Frost,</i> marked the beginning of one of the century&#x2019;s most provocative literary careers.<br><br>Visceral, raw, singular, and unforgettable, <i>Frost </i>is the story of a friendship between a young man beginning his medical career and a painter in his final days. The youth has accepted an unusual assignment, to travel to a miserable mining town in the middle of nowhere in order to clinically&#x2014;and secretly&#x2014;observe and report on his mentor&#x2019;s reclusive brother, the painter Strauch. Carefully disguising himself as a law student with a love of Henry James, he befriends the aging artist and attempts to carry out his mission, only to find himself caught up in his subject&#x2019;s apparent madness.</p><p>Thomas Bernhard was born in Holland in 1931 and grew up in Austria. His interest in music and theater led him to study at the Akademie Mozarteum in Salzburg. He published nine novels, an autobiography, one volume of poetry, four collections of short stories, and six volumes of plays. He died in Austria in 1989.First DayA medical internship consists of more than spectating at complicated bowel operations, cutting open stomach linings, bracketing off lungs, and sawing off feet; and it doesn't just consist of thumbing closed the eyes of the dead, and hauling babies out into the world either. An internship is not just tossing limbs and parts of limbs over your shoulder into an enamel bucket. Nor does it just consist of trotting along behind the registrar and the assistant and the assistant's assistant, a sort of tail-end Charlie. Nor can an internship be only the putting out of false information; it isn't just saying: "The pus will dissolve in your bloodstream, and you'll soon be restored to perfect health." Or a hundred other such lies. Not just: "It'll get better"&#x2014;when nothing will. An internship isn't just an academy of scissors and thread, of tying off and pulling through. An internship extends to circumstances and possibilities that have nothing to do with the flesh. My mission to observe the painter Strauch compels me to think about precisely such non-flesh-related circumstances and issues. The exploration of something unfathomably mysterious. The making of sometimes very far-reaching discoveries. The way you might investigate a conspiracy, say. And it is perfectly possible that the non-flesh-related, by which I don't mean the soul&#x2014;that what is non-flesh-related, without being the soul, of which I can't say for certain whether it exists, though I must say I assume it does, that this thousand-year-old working assumption is a thousand-year-old truth&#x2014;but it is perfectly possible that the non-flesh-related, which is to say, the non-cell-based, is the thing from which everything takes its being, and not the other way round, nor yet some sort of interdependence. Second Day I took the earliest train at four thirty. Passed through sheer rock. When I boarded the train, I was shivering. Gradually I warmed up. Further, the voices of the workers coming home off the night shift. I felt for them right away. Men and women, old and young, but all with the same voices of utter exhaustion, from their heads and their breasts and their balls down to their boot soles. The men in gray caps, the women in red headscarves. They wrapped their legs in scraps of loden cloth; that's the only way they know of keeping the cold at bay. I knew at once that they were a group of snow-shovelers who had got on at Sulzau. It felt as warm as in a cow's belly: the air felt as if it was being pumped from body to body with incredible pressure from some collective muscle. Doesn't bear thinking about! I pressed my back hard against the wall of the compartment. Because I hadn't slept all night, I dropped off. When I woke up, I saw again the trail of blood that trickled unevenly along the wet floor of the wagon, like a stream threading its way between mountains, ending up between the window and the window frame, under the emergency brake. It originated from a crushed bird that had been cut in half by a sudden jerk of the window. Maybe days ago. Shut so hard, there wasn't the trace of a draft. The conductor, going by in performance of his dismal duty, had taken no notice of the dead bird. But he must have seen it. I knew that. Suddenly I heard the story of a lineman who had been asphyxiated in a snowstorm, which ended: "He never cared about anything." I don't know if it was my exterior, or something inside me, finding some expression, the aura of my thoughts, of my task, energetically preparing itself in me--but no one sat down near me, even though over time every seat became precious. The train wheezed through the river valley. In my thoughts, I was once briefly at home. Then I was far away again, in some city I once walked through. Then I saw specks of dust on my left sleeve, which I tried to brush off with my right arm. The workers pulled out knives, and cut bread. They choked down great thick lumps of bread, and ate pieces of meat and wurst with them. Great chunks that no one would ever eat at a table. Only on their laps. They all drank ice-cold beer, and were evidently too enfeebled to laugh at themselves, even though they felt they were worth laughing at. They were so tired, it didn't even occur to them to do up their flies or wipe their mouths. I thought: When they get home, they'll fall straight into bed. And at five in the afternoon, when everyone else knocks off, they'll start again. The train rattled and plunged down, like the river running beside it. If anything, it seemed to be getting darker. The room is as small and uncomfortable as my intern's room in Schwarzach. If it's the roar of the river that's unbearable there, here it's the silence. At my request, the landlady took down the curtains. (It's always like that with me: I don't like having curtains in rooms that frighten me.) The landlady is disgusting to me. It's the same disgust I felt when I was a child and had to vomit outside the open doors of the slaughterhouse. If she were dead I would, today, feel no disgust--dead bodies on the dissecting table never remind me of live bodies--but she's alive, and living in a moldy ancient reek of inn kitchens. Apparently she likes me, though, because she lugged my suitcase upstairs, and offered to bring me breakfast in bed every morning, which is absolutely at variance with her normal practice. "The painter's an exception," she said. He was another long-stay guest, and long-stay guests enjoyed certain privileges. Even though, as far as innkeepers were concerned, they were "more trouble than they were worth." How had I happened to wind up at her inn? "By chance," I said. I wanted to recuperate quickly, and return home, where a mountain of work was waiting for me. She seemed understanding. I told her my name and showed her my passport. So far I haven't seen anyone but the landlady, even though I heard a lot of noise in the inn in the interval. At lunchtime, when I stayed in my room, I asked the landlady about the painter, and she said he was in the forest. "He's almost always in the forest," she said. He wouldn't be back before supper. Was I acquainted with the painter? she asked. "No," I said. Silently standing in the doorway, she seemed to pose an urgent question, as woman to man. I was startled, and&#x2014;without a word, though not without an edge of nausea&#x2014;refused her offer. Weng is the most dismal place I have ever seen. Far more dismal than in the assistant doctor's description. Doctor Strauch had spoken about it in the sort of veiled terms one might use to describe a dangerous path to a friend who has to go there. The assistant stuck to intimations. He tied me more and more tightly to the task with invisible ropes, creating an unbearable tension between him and me, while I felt the arguments he remorselessly advanced against me like nails being driven into my brain. He did at least manage not to irritate me. Confined himself rigidly to points I had to observe. I really was frightened by this landscape, in particular this one spot, which is populated by small, fully grown people whom one can certainly call cretins. No taller than five feet on average, begotten in drunkenness, they pass in and out through cracks in the walls and corridors. They seem typical of this valley. Weng is at a considerable elevation, but still stuck at the bottom of a gorge. It's impossible to get out up the cliff walls. The only way out is by train. It's so ugly that it's characterful; far prettier landscapes have no character. Everyone there has tipsy children's voices, scraped away to a high C, which they drill into you as you pass by. Jab into you. Jab from the shadows, I have to say, because in truth I have only seen shadows of people so far, human shadows, in poverty and in a dank tremor of frenzy. And those voices, jabbing at me out of the shadows, first of all confused me, and then drove me faster on my way. But these realizations were nonetheless sober ones; they didn't depress me. Actually all I felt was annoyance, because it was all so incredibly inhospitable. On top of everything, I had to lug my cardboard suitcase, with its contents jumbling together. The way up to Weng from the train station, where the industrial park is and where the big power plant is being built, can only be covered on foot. Five kilometers, which can't be shortened in any way, least of all in this season. Barking, howling dogs everywhere. I could imagine people being driven mad in the long run, if they were compelled to experience uninterruptedly the sort of thing I had to experience on the way up to Weng, and in Weng itself, if they weren't distracted by their work or by pleasure or other appropriate activities, as for instance whores, or church, or drinking, or all three at once. What brings a man like the painter Strauch to such a place, and to such a place at such a time, that it must be like a repeated slap in the face? My assignment is highly confidential, and I think it was deliberately entrusted to me suddenly, from one day to the next. The assistant must have spent some time nursing the idea of charging me with the observation of his brother. And why me? Why not one of the others, interns like myself? Because I often came to him with difficult questions, and the others didn't? He specifically told me on no account to arouse the least suspicion in the painter Strauch that there had been any communication between himself, the surgeon Strauch his brother, and myself. That's why I am also to say, if asked, that I am studying law, so as to divert attention from medicine. The assistant paid for my travel and board. He gave me a sum of money that seemed ample to him to cover everything. He demands precise observation of his brother, nothing more. Description of his behavior, of the course of his typical day; information about his opinions, intentions, expressions, judgments. A report on his walk. On his way of gesticulating, flying off the handle, "keeping people at bay." On the way he handled his walking stick. "Watch the way my brother holds his stick, I want a precise description of it." It's twenty years since the surgeon last saw the painter. Twelve years since their last letters. The painter describes the relationship as hostile. "Even so, as a doctor, I will make an effort," said the assistant. For which he needed my help. My observations would be extremely useful to him, more than anything he had yet undertaken. "My brother," he told me, "is unmarried, as I am. He lives, as they say, in his head. But he's terminally confused. Haunted by vice, shame, awe, reproach, examples&#x2014;my brother is a walker, a man in fear. And a misanthrope." This assignment is a private initiative on the part of the assistant, but I am to view it as part of my apprenticeship in Schwarzach. It's the first time that observation has presented itself to me as work. I had intended to take with me Koltz on diseases of the brain, divided into "hyper-activity" and "lesions" of the brain, but in the end I didn't. Instead I took along a book of Henry James's, which I had started in Schwarzach. At four o'clock I left the inn. In the sudden massive quiet I was seized by a feeling of unease. My sensation&#x2014;of having put on the room like a straitjacket, and now needing to take it off&#x2014;made me charge down the stairs. I went into the public bar. When, after several shouts, no one came, I went outside. I stumbled over a chunk of ice, picked myself up, and found an objective: a tree stump some twenty yards away. There I stopped. Now I could see lots of similar stumps sticking out of the snow, as if shredded by shelling, dozens and dozens of them. It occurred to me that, sitting on my bed for a couple of hours, I had been asleep. My arrival and the new setting had taken it out of me. Must be the F�hn, I thought. Then I saw a man emerging from the piece of forest a hundred yards ahead of me: undoubtedly it was the painter Strauch. All I could see of him was a torso; his legs were concealed in deep snowdrifts. I was struck by his big black hat. Reluctantly, as it appeared to me, the painter made his way from one stump to the next. Propped himself on his stick, and then pushed off with it, as if he were drover, stick, and animal bound for the slaughterhouse, all at the same time. But such an impression faded immediately, and I was left with the question of how to get to him as quickly and correctly as I could. What should I say to him? I thought. Do I go up to him and ask him a question, in other words, do I follow the traditional method of asking about the time or the place? Yes? No? For a while I vacillated. I decided I would cut him off. "I'm looking for the inn," I said. And that was it. He scrutinized me, because my sudden appearance was more alarming than inspiring of confidence&#x2014;and took me with him. He was a long-term resident at the inn, he said. Anyone coming to stay in Weng had to be either an eccentric or mistaken. Anyone looking for a holiday. "In<i> that </i>inn?" It wasn't possible to be so callow as to fail to see immediately that that was absurd. "In this area?" Such a thing could only occur to a fool. "Or a prospective suicide." He asked me who I was, what I was studying, because surely I was "still studying" something or other, and I answered, as if it were the most natural thing in the world: "Law." That was enough for him. "You go on ahead. I'm an old man," he said. The way he looked frightened me for long moments, forcing me back into myself, the way I saw him the first time, so helpless.</p><h2>The Cross and its Shadow</h2><p>This is a reprint of an important early Advent book, which explains the sanctuary and its services.

Bix offers the first complete, unvarnished look at the enigmatic leader whose sixty-three-year reign ushered Japan into the modern world. Never before has the full life of this controversial figure been revealed with such clarity and vividness. Bix shows what it was like to be trained from birth for a lone position at the apex of the nation's political hierarchy and as a revered symbol of divine status. Influenced by an unusual combination of the Japanese imperial tradition and a modern scientific worldview, the young emperor gradually evolves into his preeminent role, aligning himself with the growing ultranationalist movement, perpetuating a cult of religious emperor worship, resisting attempts to curb his power, and all the while burnishing his image as a reluctant, passive monarch. Here we see Hirohito as he truly was: a man of strong will and real authority.</p><p>Supported by a vast array of previously untapped primary documents, <em>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan </em>is perhaps most illuminating in lifting the veil on the mythology surrounding the emperor's impact on the world stage. Focusing closely on Hirohito's interactions with his advisers and successive Japanese governments, Bix sheds new light on the causes of the China War in 1937 and the start of the Asia-Pacific War in 1941. And while conventional wisdom has had it that the nation's increasing foreign aggression was driven and maintained not by the emperor but by an elite group of Japanese militarists, the reality, as witnessed here, is quite different. Bix documents in detail the strong, decisive role Hirohito played in wartime operations, from the takeover of Manchuria in 1931 through the attack on Pearl Harbor and ultimately the fateful decision in 1945 to accede to an unconditional surrender. In fact, the emperor stubbornly prolonged the war effort and then used the horrifying bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, together with the Soviet entrance into the war, as his exit strategy from a no-win situation. From the moment of capitulation, we see how American and Japanese leaders moved to justify the retention of Hirohito as emperor by whitewashing his wartime role and reshaping the historical consciousness of the Japanese people. The key to this strategy was Hirohito's alliance with General MacArthur, who helped him maintain his stature and shed his militaristic image, while MacArthur used the emperor as a figurehead to assist him in converting Japan into a peaceful nation. Their partnership ensured that the emperor's image would loom large over the postwar years and later decades, as Japan began to make its way in the modern age and struggled -- as it still does -- to come to terms with its past.</p><p>Until the very end of a career that embodied the conflicting aims of Japan's development as a nation, Hirohito remained preoccupied with politics and with his place in history. <em>Hirohito and the Making of Modern Japan</em> provides the definitive account of his rich life and legacy. Meticulously researched and utterly engaging, this book is proof that the history of twentieth-century Japan cannot be understood apart from the life of its most remarkable and enduring leader.</p></p><p>To many, Emperor Hirohito of Japan is remembered as a helpless figurehead during Japan's wars with China and the U.S. According to the received wisdom, he knew nothing of the plan to bomb Pearl Harbor and had no power to stop atrocities like the Rape of Nanking. The emperor was the mild-mannered little man who traipsed with Mickey Mouse in Disneyland and who brought peace through surrender, certainly not "one of the most disingenuous persons ever to occupy the modern throne." Herbert Bix's charged political biography, however, argues that such accepted beliefs are myths and misrepresentations spun by both Japanese and Americans to protect the emperor from indictment. Since Hirohito's death in 1989, hundreds of documents, diaries, and scholarly studies have been published (and subsequently ignored) in Japan. Historian Bix used these sources to develop this shocking and nuanced portrait of a man far more shrewd, activist, and energetic than previously thought. Caught up in the fever of territorial expansion, Hirohito was the force that animated the war system, who, acting fully as a military leader and head of state, encouraged the belligerency of his people and pursued the war to its disastrous conclusion. To the very end, Hirohito refused to acknowledge any responsibility for his role in the death of millions as well as the brutalities inflicted by his forces in China, Korea, and the Philippines. In fact, he worked with none other than General MacArthur to select his fall guys and fix testimony at the Tokyo War Crimes Trials--the emperor trying to protect the throne at all cost, the U.S. acting to ensure control of the Japanese population and the military by retaining Hirohito as a figurehead. <p> Not surprisingly, this hefty work of scholarship is making waves, as Americans and Japanese reconsider their roles in WWII and its aftermath. By placing Hirohito back in the center of the picture and puncturing the myths that surround him, Bix has effectively asked the Japanese to come out of their half-century repression of the past and face their wartime responsibility. Without doing so, he implies, the monarchy will forever impede the development of democracy. For those interested in Japan's wartime past and its influence on the present, this is fascinating, if lengthy, reading. <i>--Lesley Reed</i></p>Herbert P.

The author, who is a home economist and a granddaughter of Anne's creator, L. M. Montgomery, has selected recipes inspired by passages from the Anne books. The result is a delightful match of captivating quotations to appropriate delicacies. Anne's lament, ``I wish people could live on pudding. Why can't they, Marilla? I want to know,'' accompanies a butterscotch pudding recipe which could surely prove life-sustaining. Strategic cooking tips and definitions of essential culinary terms precede the simple but appealing recipes, all of which include lists of utensils needed. Novice cooks (and their parents) will welcome MacDonald's step-by-step procedures and selection of inexpensive ingredients. The emphasis is on sweets, with two-thirds of the recipes being for desserts. Delicate illustrations, some in full color, capture the essence of the series. Librarians who purchase this book can anticipate a rush on their Montgomery collections.

Although Jean Jacques Dozy&#39;s Ertsberg was the largest above-ground copper deposit ever found, it was so remote, he said, that it may as well have been &#34;on the moon.&#34; But after World War II, his dusty report reached Freeport Sulphur exploration chief Forbes Wilson, who was instantly captivated by this unlikely deposit. After pioneering a near-impossible road through the swamps and mountains of Irian Jaya, and negotiating the first foreign contract with Indonesia&#39;s Suharto government, the company shipped its first Ersberg copper in 1972. Fifteen years later, just a few kilometers from the original mine, Freeport geologists found Grasberg, a deposit with the largest gold reserves and third-largest copper reserves in the world.</p><p></p><h2>Mad About the Sixties: The Best of the Decade</h2><p>An illustrated compilation of the craziest humor published in the 1960s in the nation&#39;s craziest--and most popular--humor magazine includes movie parodies, political satire, memorable MAD covers, classic features, and much more. Original. QPB.</p><p>When American kids of a certain vintage--Bill Clinton, for example, but not Bob Dole--put down their childish things, they picked up <i>MAD</i> magazine. It didn't leave their hands until adulthood hit, and maybe after. The magazine ain't what it used to be, so it's easy to forget how keen it once was. <i>MAD About the Sixties</i> is a long-overdue collection of material from that seminal humor magazine's salad days. It's a welcome reminder that when <i>MAD</i> was good, it was very, very good: it featured solid writing coupled with great art, month after month. The movie and television parodies ("Bats-Man," "Star Blech") are sure to be a hit, whether you saw the originals the first time around or as reruns. While it helps to have lived through the era--particularly for the ad parodies--there's enough generic daffiness in <i>MAD About the Sixties</i> to satisfy the reader who never saw Wings, much less Paul McCartney's other band.Grade 7 Up&#x2013;<i>MAD</i> magazine works in much the same way as a Bugs Bunny cartoon&#x2013;the humor operates on several levels. Unfortunately, today's teens won't be able to get some of the jokes. For example, Ringo Starr's BLECCH shampoo ad makes more sense if you actually remember the Breck Girl ads. The book also features people who may be unfamiliar to YAs, including Adlai Stevenson and Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. Still, the volume is bound to find an appreciative audience, and <i>MAD</i> fans will be delighted to see the first-ever Snappy Answers to Stupid Questions, as well as the first <i>MAD</i> fold-in (featuring Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton). Readers will also enjoy early versions of the magazine's staples like Spy vs. Spy and The Lighter Side. This volume features parodies of popular television programs like (Holy Kinsey Report!) <i>Batman</i>, <i>Mod Squad</i>, <i>The Fugitive</i>, and <i>Star Trek</i>. Teens won't know that Uptight Is a Dry Sugar Cube is a spoof on Happiness Is a Warm Puppy, but they won't need to in order to laugh about their parents' and grandparents' generations.<i>&#x2013;Andrea Lipinski, New York Public Library</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

He should know. Hazel's father is Jack Nash, the host of America's favorite conspiracy TV show, The House of Secrets. Even as a child, she loved hearing her dad's tall tales, especially the one about a leather book belonging to Benedict Arnold that was hidden in a corpse. Now, years later, Hazel wakes up in the hospital and remembers nothing, not even her own name. She's told she's been in a car accident that killed her father and injured her brother. But she can't remember any of it, because of her own traumatic brain injury. Then a man from the FBI shows up, asking questions about her dad-and about his connection to the corpse of a man found with an object stuffed into his chest: a priceless book that belonged to Benedict Arnold. Back at her house, Hazel finds guns that she doesn't remember owning. On her forehead, she sees scars from fights she can't recall. Most important, the more Hazel digs, the less she likes the person she seems to have been. Trying to put together the puzzle pieces of her past and present, Hazel Nash needs to figure out who killed this man-and how the book wound up in his chest. The answer will tell her the truth about her father, what he was really doing for the government-and who Hazel really is. Mysteries need to be solved. Especially the ones about yourself. <br></p><p><b>Brad Meltzer </b>is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of <i>The Inner Circle</i>, <i>The Book of Fate</i>, and seven other bestselling thrillers.

She lives in a suburb of St. Louis with her family.<b><i>1</i> <br><br>I&#x2019;d fallen asleep cuddled between two of the men I loved most, with one arm flung across their naked bodies so I could touch the third. All three of them were warm when I fell asleep, but when my phone woke me hours later, only two of the bodies in the bed were still warm. The only vampire in the bed had died when the sun came up a mile over our heads in our nice safe cave of a bedroom. It was great for vampires, but if you were afraid of the dark or didn&#x2019;t like the idea of tons of stone pressing down on your head, well, you couldn&#x2019;t sleep with us.<br><br>I scrambled over Nathaniel&#x2019;s almost fever-hot body for my phone, which was plugged in on the bedside table, but when the screen came on it was his phone, not mine, because his lock screen was a picture of the three of us and mine was a close-up of our hands entwined with the new engagement rings. I finally got my phone and hit the button, but it had already gone to voice mail.<br><br>Micah asked in a voice thick with sleep, &#x201c;Who was it?&#x201d;<br><br>I squinted at the bright screen in the very dark room and said, &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recognize the number, or hell, the area code. I think it&#x2019;s international. Who the hell would be calling me from out of the country?&#x201d;<br><br>Nathaniel snuggled against the front of my body, burying his face between my breasts, as he tucked himself lower under the covers. He mumbled something, but since he was both the heaviest sleeper and the most likely to talk in his sleep, I didn&#x2019;t pay much attention.<br><br>&#x201c;What time is it?&#x201d; Micah asked, his voice less sleep-filled and closer to awake.<br><br>&#x201c;Five a.m.,&#x201d; I said. I clicked my phone to black and tried to put it back on the bedside table, but Nathaniel had pinned me and I couldn&#x2019;t quite reach.<br><br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve only been asleep for three hours,&#x201d; he said in a voice that was starting to sound aggrieved.<br><br>&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; I said. I was still trying to push my phone back on the edge of the table with a now firmly asleep Nathaniel weighing me down.<br><br>Micah wrapped his arm around my waist and Nathaniel&#x2019;s back and pulled us both closer to him. &#x201c;Sleep, must have more sleep,&#x201d; he said with his face buried between my shoulders. If I didn&#x2019;t slide down into the covers soon, they&#x2019;d both be asleep and I&#x2019;d be pinned with my arms and shoulders bared. The bedroom at night was about fifty degrees; I wanted my shoulders covered. I gave one last push to my phone, which fell to the floor, but it didn&#x2019;t light back up, which meant it was still plugged in, so I was good with it on the floor. Screw it, I was going back to sleep.<br><br>I had to force both men to give me enough room to slide down between them so we were all covered and warm again. I was just starting to drift back to sleep to the sounds of their even breathing when my phone rang again, but this time it played a different song, George Thorogood&#x2019;s &#x201c;Bad to the Bone.&#x201d; It was the personalized ringtone for one of my best friends, Edward, assassin to the undead and fellow U.S. Marshal Ted Forrester. Interestingly, Edward and Ted were the same person; think Clark Kent and Superman.<br><br>I flung the covers off all of us and scrambled, falling to the floor and fumbling for the phone that was glowing in the pile of clothes beside the bed. I hit the button and said, &#x201c;Here, I&#x2019;m here!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Anita, are you all right?&#x201d; Edward&#x2019;s voice was too cheerful, which was all the clue I needed that he was with other police officers who would be overhearing everything.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m good. You sound awfully chipper for five a.m.,&#x201d; I said, trying not to sound like I was already getting cold outside the body heat of the bed. I started to fumble in the clothes pile for something that was mine but kept coming up with just the guys&#x2019; clothes.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s eleven a.m. here,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>He wasn&#x2019;t home in New Mexico then, so I asked, &#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dublin.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Dublin what?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Ireland,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>I sat naked and shivering on the floor, scooping through the pile of clothes around me like a bird trying to make a nest, and tried to think. I failed, so I asked, &#x201c;Why are you in Dublin, Ireland?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;For the same reason I&#x2019;m calling you, Anita.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Which is?&#x201d; I tried not to get irritated at him, because it usually amused him, and Ted usually took longer to tell anything. Edward was far more abrupt. Yes, they were the same person, but Edward was more of a method actor, and trying to get him to break character wasn&#x2019;t a good idea.<br><br>&#x201c;Vampires.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;There aren&#x2019;t any vampires in Ireland. It&#x2019;s the only country in the world that doesn&#x2019;t have them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what we all thought until about six weeks ago.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What happened six weeks ago?&#x201d; I asked, trying to burrow myself into the clothes on the floor for warmth.<br><br>Someone from the bed above me threw my robe on top of me. I told whichever of my partners had done it, &#x201c;Thanks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They had their first vampire victim,&#x201d; Edward said.<br><br>I slipped into the robe, using my chin to hold the phone against my shoulder. The black silk robe was better than being naked, but silk isn&#x2019;t really very warm. I kept meaning to buy something with a little more heat retention, but it was hard to find sexy and warm at the same time. &#x201c;Vampire victim, so dead?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, just a little drained.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, if it was nonconsensual blood donation here in the States the vampire would be up on charges, but if it was consensual it&#x2019;s not even a crime.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Vampire gaze wiped her memory of it,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;If the vampire and blood donor had agreed that the vamp could use their gaze so the donor could get the whole vampire experience, then it&#x2019;s treated like you let someone drink too much at a party and then let them walk home drunk, again it&#x2019;s not even a crime here, just bad judgment.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Vic can&#x2019;t remember, so we&#x2019;ll never know if consent was given or&nbsp;not.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If they took a swab of the bite for genetics and he, or she, is in the system, they can find the vampire in question.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Nobody believed it was a vampire bite, so they didn&#x2019;t treat it like an attack. They thought she&#x2019;d been slipped a date-rape drug.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;The fang marks weren&#x2019;t a clue?&#x201d; I asked.<br><br>&#x201c;You said it yourself, Anita: there are no vampires in Ireland. In thousands of years of history, there&#x2019;s never been a vampire here. They noted the fang marks as possible needle marks for the drug they thought had been used on the vic; if they hadn&#x2019;t been hunting for needle marks and other signs of drug use, they wouldn&#x2019;t have even found them. They are some of the tiniest, neatest marks I&#x2019;ve ever seen.&#x201d;<br><br>I sat up a little straighter, both to tie my robe tighter and because that meant something. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen almost as many vampire bites as I have.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yep,&#x201d; he said in his best Ted Forrester drawl. He was probably playing the full American cowboy, accent and all, for the Irish police. He could be the ultimate undercover person and blend in damn near anywhere, but when he was Ted, it was like he enjoyed just how thick he could play the part. I wondered if he&#x2019;d packed Ted&#x2019;s cowboy hat and brought it on the airplane. The thought of him wearing it in Ireland was either fun or cringeworthy. I wasn&#x2019;t sure which yet.<br><br>&#x201c;How tiny? Do you think it&#x2019;s a child vampire?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve seen female vamps that had a bite this small, but that one could be a child.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, that one?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have at least three different bite radiuses.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So three different vamps,&#x201d; I said.<br><br>&#x201c;At the very least, maybe more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, maybe more?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got permission to share photos with you if you can get to a computer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;My phone is a computer. Can&#x2019;t you just text me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I could, but you&#x2019;ll want a bigger screen to look at some of these.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, I&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. I can get to a computer. I just need someone to help me log on, or something.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You have a secure email account, because I&#x2019;ve sent you things to it before,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>&#x201c;I know, I know. I just don&#x2019;t use the computers here much.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Where are you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Circus of the Damned.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Tell Jean-Claude howdy for me?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Howdy? Even Ted doesn&#x2019;t say <i>Howdy</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m American, Anita. We&#x2019;re all cowboys; didn&#x2019;t you know that, darling?&#x201d; he said in a drawl so thick it sounded like you should be able to do a Texas two-step on it.<br><br>&#x201c;Yeah, like all the Irish are leprechauns and go around saying <i>Top of the morning to you</i>.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;If I had my way, you&#x2019;d be here seeing all the leprechauns.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What do you mean, if you had your way?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Go to the computer so you can see the pictures, Anita,&#x201d; and the out-West accent lost some of its thickness, fading into what was Edward&#x2019;s normal &#x201c;middle of nowhere,&#x201d; maybe Midwestern accent. I&#x2019;d known him for over six years before I&#x2019;d learned that Theodore (Ted) Forrester was his actual birth name and the one that both the military and the Marshals Service knew him by. He&#x2019;d just been Edward to me.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay, but what did you mean, if you had your way?&#x201d; I got to my feet and my lower body was instantly colder in just the silk robe without the nest of other clothes around me. I looked down at the bed, because both Micah and Nathaniel were better with the computers down the hallway than I was; hell, Nathaniel was still occasionally sneaking new ringtones for people into my phone. Some of them had been embarrassing when they sounded at work with the other marshals, but &#x201c;Bad to the Bone&#x201d; for Edward had worked so well, I kept it.<br><br>&#x201c;When you&#x2019;re at the computer, call me back,&#x201d; he said, and hung up. That was more like Edward.<br><br>Once the phone screen stopped glowing, the room was pitch-black, cave dark, so that you could touch your own eyeball because you couldn&#x2019;t see your finger coming to flinch away. We usually left the bathroom door open, so the night light inside could give some illumination, but whoever had gone in last had forgotten. The only thing that let me walk to the bathroom door without bumping anything was familiarity&nbsp;with the layout. I opened the door and it was so damn bright that for a second I thought the overhead lights had been left on; but as I blinked and adjusted to the glow, I realized it was just the night light. It looked ungodly bright because my eyes had adjusted to the thick darkness of the other room, but as my eyes readjusted to the light it was just the night light like normal.<br><br>I&#x2019;d have liked to let the men in my life sleep, but I needed help with the computers. I was really going to have to take notes the next time someone showed me how to do all this because I never seemed to remember it the way that they did. I stared down at the bed. Nathaniel had curled down into the covers so that only the top of his head and the thick braid of his nearly ankle-length hair showed. The light was just bright enough to gleam red in the brown of his auburn hair. He was curled up on his side so that his broad shoulders rose like a hunky mountain above the rest of the bed. It was impossible to tell with him curled up like that, but he was five-nine. Micah lay just out of arm&#x2019;s reach from him; they were leaving my space in the middle of them empty, waiting for me to crawl back in and sleep, which I so wanted to do, but duty called. Micah&#x2019;s curls had spilled across his face so the most skin I saw was the darker skin of his slender shoulders and one arm that showed muscles, but he would never bulk up the way Nathaniel did. Genetics had made our very dominant and commanding Nimir-Raj, leopard king, my size, five-three. You couldn&#x2019;t see it under the covers, but he was built like a swimmer with that upside-down triangle of shoulders to slender waist and hips. Nathaniel was built not only more muscular but more lush, the man&#x2019;s version of curves. �Jean-Claude lay on his back. He could sleep on his side but he preferred to sleep on his back, and since he died at dawn so he couldn&#x2019;t keep cuddling as we moved during our sleep, it wasn&#x2019;t as big a deal that he didn&#x2019;t spoon as well as the three of us, who were all side sleepers.<br><br>Jean-Claude was the tallest of us at six feet even. Lying on his back, he looked every inch of it. His long black curls fell almost to his waist now, as did mine. We both had truly black hair, me because my mother&#x2019;s family had been Mexican, and his because it just was; his skin was paler than mine, but not by much thanks to my German father. I was pretty sure that if Jean-Claude hadn&#x2019;t been a vampire I&#x2019;d have been paler than he was, but no one is paler than a vampire. Even literally dead to the world he was still one of the most beautiful men I&#x2019;d ever seen, and that was with Nathaniel and Micah to compare to, though admittedly both their faces were currently covered, but I knew what everyone looked like. I was told that I was beautiful and some days I believed it, but looking down at the three of them I was still amazed that everyone and everything in the bed was mine, and I was theirs. I caught a gleam in Micah&#x2019;s hair and realized it was his eyes open and watching me through the tangle of his rich brown curls.<br><br>I whispered, &#x201c;Were you just pretending to sleep?&#x201d;<br><br>He started to sit up and nodded.<br><br>I <i>tsk-tsk</i>ed at him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s police business.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then get a policeman to help you with the computer,&#x201d; he said, but he was already climbing out of the covers, carefully trying not to uncover the other two men.<br><br>&#x201c;Get my gun,&#x201d; I whispered.<br><br>He reached into the specially made holster attached to the headboard and my Springfield EMP, and crawled to the foot of the bed to hand it to me so that he didn&#x2019;t cross Nathaniel&#x2019;s body with it. He was nowhere near the trigger, and he was being careful, but he knew the rules for gun safety. Treat every gun as if it&#x2019;s loaded and lethal, and never, ever cross someone&#x2019;s body with it unless you mean to shoot them. I took the gun and put it in the pocket, wondering if it would hold the weapon. The gun fit, but my robe was seriously hanging crooked from the weight. I tied the sash at my waist even tighter and tried to see if my hand would fit into the pocket well enough for me to draw the gun if I had to; it wasn&#x2019;t perfect, but it worked.<br></b></p><h2>Forgotten Fifteenth: The Daring Airmen Who Crippled Hitler&#39;s War Machine</h2><p><b>November 1943 May 1945</b> The U.S. Army Air Forces waged an unprecedentedly dogged and violent campaign against Hitler&#x2019;s vital oil production and industrial plants on the Third Reich&#x2019;s southern flank.

A heat wave in the middle of the school holidays, exactly where it belonged. Every morning the sun was up long before they were, making a mockery of the flimsy summer curtains that hung limply at their bedroom windows, a sun already hot and sticky with promise before Olivia even opened her eyes. Olivia, as reliable as a rooster, always the first to wake, so that no one in the house had bothered with an alarm clock since she was born three years ago. <br>Olivia, the youngest and therefore the one currently sleeping in the small back bedroom with the nursery-rhyme wallpaper, a room that all of them had occupied and been ousted from in turn. Olivia, as cute as a button, they were all agreed, even Julia who had taken a long time to get over being displaced as the baby of the family, a position she had occupied for five satisfying years before Olivia came along.<br><br>Rosemary, their mother, said that she wished Olivia could stay at this age for ever because she was so <i>lovable</i>. They had never heard her use that word to describe any of them. They had not even realized that such a word existed in her vocabulary, which was usually restricted to tedious commands &#x2014; <i>come here, go away, be quiet,</i> and &#x2014; most frequent of all &#x2014; <i>stop that</i>. Sometimes she would walk into a room or appear in the garden, glare at them and say, <i>whatever it is you're doing, don't</i>, and then simply walk away again, leaving them feeling aggrieved and badly done by, even when caught red-handed in the middle of some piece of mischief &#x2014; devised by Sylvia usually.<br><br>Their capacity for wrongdoing, especially under Sylvia's reckless leadership, was apparently limitless. The eldest three were (everyone agreed) 'a handful', too close together in age to be distinguishable to their mother so that they had evolved into a collective child to which she found it hard to attribute individual details and which she addressed at random &#x2014; <i>Julia- Sylvia- Amelia- whoever you are</i> &#x2014; said in an exasperated tone as if it was their fault there were so many of them. Olivia was usually excluded from this weary litany; Rosemary never seemed to get her mixed up with the rest of them.<br><br>They had supposed Olivia would be the last to occupy the small back bedroom and that one day the nursery-rhyme wallpaper would finally be scraped off (by their harassed mother because their father said hiring a professional decorator was a waste of money) and be replaced by something more grown-up &#x2014; flowers or perhaps ponies, although anything would be better than the Elastoplast pink adorning the room that Julia and Amelia shared, a colour that had looked so promising to the two of them on the paint chart and proved so alarming on the walls and which their mother said she didn't have the time or money (or <i>energy</i>) to replace.<br><br>Now it transpired that Olivia was going to be undertaking the same rite of passage as her older sisters, leaving behind the &#x2014; rather badly aligned &#x2014; Humpty-Dumptys and Little Miss Muffets to make way for an <i>afterthought</i> whose advent had been announced, in a rather offhand way, by Rosemary the previous day as she dished out a makeshift lunch of corned-beef sandwiches and orange squash on the lawn.<br><br>'Wasn't Olivia the afterthought?' Sylvia said to no one in particular, and Rosemary frowned at her eldest daughter as if she had just noticed her for the first time. Sylvia, thirteen and until recently an enthusiastic child (many people would have said overenthusiastic), promised to be a mordant cynic in her teenage years. Gawky, bespectacled Sylvia, her teeth recently caged in ugly orthodontic braces, had greasy hair, a hooting laugh and the long, thin fingers and toes of a creature from outer space. Well-meaning people called her an 'ugly duckling' (said to her face, as if it was a compliment, which was certainly not how it was taken by Sylvia), imagining a future Sylvia casting off her braces, acquiring contact lenses and a bosom, and blossoming into a swan. Rosemary did not see the swan in Sylvia, especially when she had a shred of corned beef stuck in her braces. Sylvia had recently developed an unhealthy obsession with religion, claiming that God had spoken to her. Rosemary wondered if it was a normal phase that adolescent girls went through, if God was merely an alternative to pop stars or ponies. Rosemary decided it was best to ignore Sylvia's t�te-�-t�tes with the Almighty. And at least conversations with God were free, whereas the upkeep on a pony would have cost a fortune.<br><br>And the peculiar fainting fits that their GP said were on account of Sylvia 'outgrowing her strength' - a medically dubious explanation if ever there was one (in Rosemary's opinion). Rosemary decided to ignore the fainting fits as well. They were probably just Sylvia's way of getting attention.<br><br>Rosemary married their father Victor when she was eighteen years old &#x2014; only five years older than Sylvia was now. The idea that Sylvia might be grown-up enough in five years' time to marry anyone struck Rosemary as ridiculous and reinforced her belief that her own parents should have stepped in and stopped her marrying Victor, should have pointed out that she was a mere child and he was a thirty-six-year-old man. She often found herself wanting to remonstrate with her mother and father about their lack of parental care, but her mother had succumbed to stomach cancer not long after Amelia was born and her father had remarried and moved to Ipswich, where he spent most of his days in the bookies and all of his evenings in the pub.<br><br>If, in five years' time, Sylvia brought home a thirty-six-year-old, cradle-snatching fianc� (particularly if he claimed to be a great mathematician) then Rosemary thought she would probably cut his heart out with the carving knife. This thought was so agreeable that the <i>afterthought</i>'s annunciation was temporarily forgotten and Rosemary allowed them all to run out to the ice-cream van when it declared its own melodic arrival in the street.<br><br>The Sylvia-Amelia-Julia trio knew that there was no such thing as an <i>afterthought</i> and the 'foetus', as Sylvia insisted on calling it (she was keen on science subjects), that was making their mother so irritable and lethargic was probably their father's last-ditch attempt to acquire a son. He was not a father who doted on daughters, he showed no real fondness for any of them, only Sylvia occasionally winning his respect because she was 'good at maths'. Victor was a mathematician and lived a rarefied life of the mind where his family were allowed no trespass. This was made easy by the fact that he spent hardly any time with them: he was either in the department or in his rooms in college and when he was home he shut himself in his study, occasionally with his students but usually on his own. Their father had never taken them to the open-air pool on Jesus Green, played rousing games of Snap or Donkey, never tossed them in the air and caught them or pushed them on a swing, had never taken them punting on the river or walking on the Fens or on educational trips to the Fitzwilliam. More like an absence than a presence, everything he was &#x2014; and was not &#x2014; was represented by the sacrosanct space of his study.<br><br>They would have been surprised to know that the study had once been a bright parlour with a view of the back garden, a room where previous occupants of the house had enjoyed pleasant breakfasts, where women had whiled away the afternoons with sewing and romantic novels, and where in the evenings the family had gathered to play cribbage or Scrabble while listening to a radio play. All of these activities had been envisaged by a newly married Rosemary when the house was first bought &#x2014; in 1956, at a price way beyond their budget &#x2014; but Victor immediately claimed the room as his own and somehow managed to transform it into a sunless place, crammed with heavy bookshelves and ugly oak filing cabinets, and reeking of the untipped Capstans that he smoked. The loss of the room was as nothing to the loss of the way of life that Rosemary had planned to fill it with.</p><h2>The Tipping Point: How Little Things Can Make a Big Difference</h2><p>The tipping point is that magic moment when an idea, trend, or social behavior crosses a threshold, tips, and spreads like wildfire. Just as a single sick person can start an epidemic of the flu, so too can a small but precisely targeted push cause a fashion trend, the popularity of a new product, or a drop in the crime rate. This widely acclaimed bestseller, in which Malcolm Gladwell explores and brilliantly illuminates the tipping point phenomenon, is already changing the way people throughout the world think about selling products and disseminating ideas.</p><p>"The best way to understand the dramatic transformation of unknown books into bestsellers, or the rise of teenage smoking, or the phenomena of word of mouth or any number of the other mysterious changes that mark everyday life," writes Malcolm Gladwell, "is to think of them as epidemics. Ideas and products and messages and behaviors spread just like viruses do." Although anyone familiar with the theory of memetics will recognize this concept, Gladwell's <i>The Tipping Point</i> has quite a few interesting twists on the subject.<p> For example, Paul Revere was able to galvanize the forces of resistance so effectively in part because he was what Gladwell calls a "Connector": he knew just about everybody, particularly the revolutionary leaders in each of the towns that he rode through. But Revere "wasn't just the man with the biggest Rolodex in colonial Boston," he was also a "Maven" who gathered extensive information about the British. He knew what was going on and he knew exactly whom to tell. The phenomenon continues to this day--think of how often you've received information in an e-mail message that had been forwarded at least half a dozen times before reaching you.</p><p> Gladwell develops these and other concepts (such as the "stickiness" of ideas or the effect of population size on information dispersal) through simple, clear explanations and entertainingly illustrative anecdotes, such as comparing the pedagogical methods of <i>Sesame Street</i> and <i>Blue's Clues</i>, or explaining why it would be even easier to play Six Degrees of Kevin Bacon with the actor Rod Steiger. Although some readers may find the transitional passages between chapters hold their hands a little too tightly, and Gladwell's closing invocation of the possibilities of social engineering sketchy, even chilling, <i>The Tipping Point</i> is one of the most effective books on science for a general audience in ages. It seems inevitable that "tipping point," like "future shock" or "chaos theory," will soon become one of those ideas that everybody knows--or at least knows by name. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p>Malcolm Gladwell is also the author of the #1 bestselling &#34;Blink: The Power of Thinking Without Thinking. &#34;He was a reporter for the &#34;Washington Post&#34; from 1987 to 1996, working first as a science writer and then as New York City bureau chief.

While acknowledging the many women whose contributions to visual culture since the Middle Ages have often been neglected, Whitney Chadwick's survey reexamines the works themselves and the ways in which they have been perceived as marginal, often in direct reference to gender. In her discussion of feminism and its influence on such a reappraisal, the author also addresses the closely related issues of ethnicity, class, and sexuality.<br><br> This expanded edition incorporates recent developments in contemporary art. Chadwick addresses the turn toward autobiography in much recent women's art. She considers issues such as the personal versus the political and the private versus the public, and analyzes the differences between women's art today and the seminal feminist work of the 1970s and 1980s. 325 illustrations, 90 in color</p><p>Whitney Chadwick is an art historian. She is the author of Women Artists and the Surrealist Movement and Women, Art and Society.Like many women artists of the time, Gentileschi and Sirani were the daughters of painters. Orazio Gentileschi was one of the most important of Caravaggio&#39;s followers; Giovanni Andrea Sirani a pupil and follower of Reni, and an artist of considerably less interest than his daughter. Gentileschi is the first woman artist in the history of Western art whose historical significance is unquestionable. In the case of Sirani, her early death has prevented a full evaluation of her career despite her evident fame during her life. Sirani&#39;s father took all of her income from a body of work which she herself, following a custom gaining favor during the seventeenth century, catalogued at 150 paintings, a figure now considered too low. Despite her catalogue, no monograph exists and her reputation has suffered from an over-attribution of inferior works in Reni&#39;s style to her.</p><h2>From The Mixed-up Files Of Mrs. Basil E.

Considerable evidence points to the likeliest author as one Sir Thomas Malory or Maleore of Newbold Revell in Warwickshire, who was born in the first quarter of the fifteenth century. A member of the gentry, he became a soldier in the service of Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, with whom he fought in the siege of Calais in 1436. In records of the period he is accused of various crimes--including armed robbery, attempted murder, and rape--and he is said to have executed several dramatic escapes from prison. <br>Several things about Malory seem indisputable. As in Arthur's time when post-Roman Britain was in a state of fierce tribal war, he lived in an age of great unrest. Europe was still recovering from the Black Plague and a century of war. In England, two powerful families fought for the throne. Although he may have been a scoundrel, Malory was also, it seems clear, a man of ideals who believed in courage and loyalty, and who mourned the passing of chivalry. Incarcerated for long periods, he had many hours to fill his imagination with French romances and tales of chivalry, volumes of which were readily at hand. It is thought that Le Morte d'Arthur was written during his imprisonment. <br>Malory referred to himself as a 'knight-prisoner.' With a military man's passion for the details of conquest, a prisoner's sense of injustice, and a penitent's desire for redemption, he dedicated himself wholeheartedly to this retelling of the Arthurian legends. Sir Thomas Malory died, it is presumed, around 1471.</p><h2>THE Unbound (The Archived)</h2><p><br><em>Imagine a place where the dead rest on shelves like books.<br></em><br>Each body has a story to tell, a life seen in pictures that only Librarians can read. The dead are called Histories, and the vast realm in which they rest is the Archive.<br><br>Last summer, Mackenzie Bishop, a Keeper tasked with stopping violent Histories from escaping the Archive, almost lost her life to one. Now, as she starts her junior year at Hyde School, she's struggling to get her life back. But moving on isn't easy -- not when her dreams are haunted by what happened. She knows the past is past, knows it cannot hurt her, but it feels so real, and when her nightmares begin to creep into her waking hours, she starts to wonder if she's really safe. <br><br>Meanwhile, people are vanishing without a trace,and the only thing they seem to have in common is <em>Mackenzie</em>. She's sure the Archive knows more than they are letting on, but before she can prove it, she becomes the prime suspect. And unless Mac can track down the real culprit, she'll lose everything, not only her role as Keeper, but her memories, and even her life. Can Mackenzie untangle the mystery before she herself unravels? <br><br>With stunning prose and a captivating mixture of action, romance, and horror, <em>The Unbound</em> delves into a richly imagined world where no choice is easy and love and loss feel like two sides of the same coin.</p><p><br><strong>Victoria Schwab</strong> (www.VictoriaSchwab.com) is the author of several novels, including, <i>The Near Witch</i>-which <i>Kirkus</i> praised for its "shivery horror tang" and "extraordinary sense of place"-and <i>The Archived</i>, of which <i>The Horn Book</i> said "[Schwab] writes of death, sorrow, and family love with a light, intelligent touch and inventive vigor, and provides romance with a pleasing edge of unpredictability." When she is not wandering through foreign countries, Victoria can usually be found tucked in the corner of a coffee shop in Nashville, sipping tea and dreaming of monsters.<br>Mackenzie transfers to an exclusive school for her junior year, but acceptance is the least of her worries. As a Keeper, Mackenzie serves the Archive by returning wandering ghosts (Histories) to the Library shelves, thus preserving the equilibrium between the dead and the living. At the last book's conclusion, she was almost killed by a History and now struggles with anxiety and nightmares. Meanwhile, Archive leadership questions her competence, and she finds herself falling for enigmatic, loyal fellow Keeper. While there's more focus on action than character development, Schwab continues to explore themes of loss, grief, and recovery, contrasting Mackenzie's physical dangers with her PTSD. Several surprises prime readers for future titles. - Debbie Carton Booklist Online"<br><br>In The Archived (rev. 1/13), the dead are Histories, each a body of memories to be catalogued by the Archive's Librarians. Mackenzie is a Keeper, whose job is to put wakeful Histories in their proper place. That's what she has done with Owen, a renegade History-but now, in this second volume, it seems she hasn't quite managed to shelve him. He terrifies her in nightmares and even appears in her waking life, disrupting her efforts to adapt to her swish private school and keep up with her Archive work-and her relationship with caring, mysterious Wesley, also a Keeper. Then Mackenzie becomes associated with a series of deaths and disappearances. Are sleeplessness and memory driving her mad? Schwab intensifies terror and threat here, at the same time offering loving relationships and intelligent plotting. Although she leans on characterization and interest created in The Archived, the sharpness of her prose and plot give this action-intense story abundant energy. Mackenzie has lost none of her impulse for analysis ("I've always thought of [people] more as formulas-full of variables, but always the sum of their parts"), and although the story depends more on action and less on emotional subtlety than its predecessor, it's smart and engaging. deirdre f. baker Horn Book"<br><br>Gr 8 Up In this sequel to The Archived (Hyperion, 2013), sleep eludes Mackenzie Bishop. She's traumatized by violent nightmares of Owen and later theorizes that the sadistic History might not be confined solely to her fraying mind. People with whom Mac has limited contact start disappearing, and voids crop up where they were last seen. Mac suspects someone is trying to create evidence that will get her relieved of duty as a Keeper. When her concerned parents justifiably hover, making trips to the Archive and the Narrows difficult, Mac has trouble keeping up with the Histories assigned to her. Fortunately, charming Wesley also attends Mac's new prep school, offering more than friendship and backup. But can Mac risk getting closer to Wes with danger already her companion? An exciting climax carefully ties up certain threads, while a well-executed final chapter promises a further installment. Schwab's characters are distinct, and she has a talent for conveying the connections between them. The mystery and waiting-for-the-other-shoe-to-drop sense of foreboding is sustained throughout. Wesley and Mac's romantic tension is palpable, and their dialogue is natural, with plenty of entertaining banter. While Schwab includes bits of explanation and flashbacks, readers will be better served reading this suspenseful and engrossing supernatural series in order.

This is a satirical fantasy about ecclesiastical and other kinds of politics. The author has also written &#34;The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie&#34; and &#34;Girls of Slender Means&#34;.</p><p>Published in 1974 and inspired by Watergate, Muriel Spark's <i>Abbess of Crewe</i> is much more amusing and infinitely drier. It transpires that Alexandra, the title character, has bugged and videotaped the Abbey--except for the confessionals and chapel--with electronic "devices fearfully and wonderfully beyond the reach of a humane vocabulary." After her only rival decamps for London and the arms of a Jesuit, police and newspapers swoop in. All the while, the Abbess (an adherent of Machiavelli, The Art of War, and the Modernist poets) keeps her cool, sacrificing her confederates as necessary and trying to assure herself of helicopter-hopping Gertrude's loyalty. (Gertrude is off curing cannibals of their customs and calls in occasionally from places whose unpronounceable names will soon be replaced by other equally unpronounceable names.) Spark's nuns on the run are more than stand-ins for the sweaty American President and his operatives; the satire extends to Anglo-snobbism and -Catholicism. The Abbess explains to the Pope that "electronic surveillance (even if a convent were one day to practise it) does not differ from any other type of watchfulness, the which is a necessity of a Religious Community; we are told in the Scriptures 'to watch and to pray,' which is itself a paradox."An elegant fable about intrigue, corruption, and electronic surveillance, &#39;The Abbess of Crewe&#39; (1974) is set in an English Benedictine convent. Steely and silky Abbess Alexandra has bugged the convent, and rigged her election. But the cat gets out of the bag, and--plunged into scandal--the serene Abbess faces a Vatican inquiry.</p><h2>I&#39;ve Never Met an Idiot on the River: Reflections on Family, Fishing, and Photography</h2><p>In this delightful collection of humorous anecdotes and heartfelt observations, Henry Winkler shares the joy and wisdom he&#x2019;s accumulated while honing his skills as a fly fisherman. A accomplished sportsman who meticulously records the measurements of every fish he hooks, Winkler has learned that his yearly trips to the river are not just about catching trout. More importantly, they&#x2019;re about adopting the proper perspective on life. Or, as Winkler puts it, when he&#x2019;s fly fishing, the river acts like a washing machine for my brain,&#x201d; recharging him and reminding him that anything is possible.

Now the story has found yet another life in this enchanting illustrated edition.<br><br>It begins with a writer's dilemma: he's been asked by <i>The New York Times</i> to write a story that will appear in the paper on Christmas morning. The writer agrees, but he has a problem: How to write an unsentimental Christmas story? He unburdens himself to his friend at his local cigar shop, a colorful character named Auggie Wren. "A Christmas story? Is that all?" Auggie counters. "If you buy me lunch, my friend, I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. And I guarantee every word of it is true."<br><br>And an unconventional story it is, involving a lost wallet, a blind woman, and a Christmas dinner. Everything gets turned upside down. What's stealing? What's giving? What's a lie? What's the truth? It's vintage Auster, and pure pleasure: a truly unsentimental but completely affecting tale.<br><br></p><p><br>Paul Auster is the bestselling author of <i>Sunset Park, Invisible, Man in the Dark, Travels in the Scriptorium, The Brooklyn Follies</i>, and <i>Oracle Night</i>. <i>I Thought My Father Was God</i>, the NPR National Story Project anthology, which he edited, was also a national bestseller. In 2006, he was elected to the American Academy of Arts and Letters for Literature. His work has been translated into thirty-five languages. He lives in Brooklyn, New York.&nbsp;<br>ISOL is a celebrated Argentinian illustrator whose work has been featured internationally. She lives in Buenos Aires<br><br>Auster fans will recognize Auggie Wren as the proprietor of a Brooklyn cigar store in the film <i>Smoke</i> (1995), written by Auster and starring Harvey Keitel as Auggie. But before <i>smoke</i> came a burning dilemma: the <i>New York Times</i> invites Auster to write a Christmas story, and he is at a total loss. So he confides in Auggie, who says, in the best fairy-tale mode, "If you buy me lunch, my friend, I'll tell you the best Christmas story you ever heard. And I guarantee that every word of it is true." And so the writer listens carefully to the smoke-shop owner's tale of a young shoplifter, a lonely blind woman, and an impromptu Christmas dinner. And even if readers have heard the tale before, they will be enraptured anew, because that's how Christmas stories work. We want to read them over and over again. And this little volume is a jewel, not only because Auster is such a dazzling and canny storyteller but also because of Argentine artist ISOL's superbly jazzy illustrations. <i>Donna Seaman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

From his very first crisis assignment as point man for Lee Iaccoca's rescue team at Chrysler, Miller built an international reputation while fixing major problems in such varied industries as steel, construction, and health care. Most recently, as chairman and CEO of the bankrupt automotive parts manufacturer Delphi Corporation, he has confronted head-on the major issues threatening the survival of Detroit's Big Three. </p><p>A battle is being fought in the heart of industrial America&#x2014;or what is left of it&#x2014;Miller observes. In the auto industry as well as every manufacturing corporation, management and labor are at loggerheads over wages and the skyrocketing costs of employee benefits. The way out of this battle is often painful and Miller is deeply aware of the high price individual workers and many communities have had to pay as a result.</p><p>In this frank and unsparing memoir, Miller reveals a rarely seen side of American management. Miller recounts the inside story of the many turnaround jobs that have led to his renown as Mr. Fix It. But he also paints an intimate picture of his relationship with Maggie Miller, his wife of forty years, with whom Miller shares the credit for his success. Described by Miller as "my mentor and tormentor," Maggie served as his most trusted adviser and kept him focused on what truly matters until her death from brain cancer in 2006. </p><p>A deeply moving personal story and timely snapshot of the state of American manufacturing and what it will take to restore it to profitability, <em>The Turnaround Kid</em> is Steve Miller's fascinating look at his education as an American executive. </p></p><p><p>Robert S.

Narrator Dick Hill is an experienced narrator who knows his way around a story and offers a firm, believable reading that will engage listeners. As Miller provides a genuine-sounding account of his life, Hill captures his voice, both in personal and professional settings. The death of Miller's wife, Maggie, is a profound occurrence that affects the story from start to finish, and Hill captures the despair and heartache that permeates Miller's existence following her death. The material offers a good balance between the two worlds of Steve Miller--his professional life and his most intimate moments.

Robert Forester, a depressed but fundamentally decent man, liked to watch Jenny through her kitchen window a harmless palliative, as he saw it, to his lonely life and failed marriage. As he is drawn into her life, however, the recriminations of his simple pleasure shatter the deceptive calm of this small Pennsylvania town. With striking clarity and horrible inevitability, Forester is caught up in a series of deaths in which he is the innocent bystander, presumed guilty. Highsmith has once again, as Graham Greene wrote, created a world of her own a world claustrophobic and irrational which we enter each time with a sense of personal danger.&#x201d; And that sense of danger grows from the first page to the sinister and chilling conclusion.</p><p>Patricia Highsmith was born in Fort Worth, Texas in 1921. Her parents moved to New York when she was six, and she attended the Julia Richmond High School and Barnard College.

Her first novel, Strangers on a Train, was made into a famous film by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951.

The first volume covered 12 plays, primarily the more familiar. This one has only nine, and several are unusual fare for young readers. They have mature and often jaded perspectives, which, if not incomprehensible to adolescents, we can hope might seem a bit remote. But Antony and Cleopatra is an interesting follow-up to Julius Caesar; Measure for Measure offers complex fare for morality discussions; and the peculiar magical aspects of Winter's Tale offer an interesting contrast to The Tempest. Reading such enriched retellings of plays students might miss in high school will enhance those they do study. For the guaranteed curriculum basics, such as Julius Caesar, here is an alternative to yellow study guides, one in which explication is subliminally available in the graceful prose. The romances are appealing, and Garfield's seamless movement between his own descriptive language and Shakespeare's has never worked better. Foreman's vibrant watercolors, particularly the mesmerizing Cleopatra cover girl and an anguished Julius Caesar at the Capitol, and the many small ink-wash illustrations bring strong visual appeal to a pending classic?one that adults should not assume is just for kids.?Sally Margolis, Deerfield Public Library, <br>Copyright 1995 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Callahan Chronicals</h2><p><i>Callahan's Crosstime Saloon </i>is the neighborhood tavern to all of time and space, where the regulars are anything but: time travelers, talking dogs, alcoholic vampires, cybernetic aliens--and a group of people who really, truly care about each other.

Stephen King himself has said that he finds his early work "raw," and Brian De Palma's movie was so successful that we <i>feel</i> like we have read the novel even if we never have. The simple answer is that this is a very scary story, one that works as well--if not better--on the page as on the screen. Carrie White, menaced by bullies at school and her religious nut of a mother at home, gradually discovers that she has telekinetic powers, powers that will eventually be turned on her tormentors. King has a way of getting under the skin of his readers by creating an utterly believable world that throbs with menace before finally exploding. He builds the tension in this early work by piecing together extracts from newspaper reports, journals, and scientific papers, as well as more traditional first- and third-person narrative in order to reveal what lurks beneath the surface of Chamberlain, Maine.<p> </p><blockquote>News item from the Westover (ME) weekly <i>Enterprise</i>, August 19, 1966: "Rain of Stones Reported: It was reliably reported by several persons that a rain of stones fell from a clear blue sky on Carlin Street in the town of Chamberlain on August 17th." </blockquote> <p> Although the supernatural pyrotechnics are handled with King's customary aplomb, it is the carefully drawn portrait of the little horrors of small towns, high schools, and adolescent sexuality that give this novel its power, and assures its place in the King canon. <i>--Simon Leake</i></p>El escalofriante caso de una joven en apariencia insignificante que se transform� en un ser de poderes anormales, sembrando el terror en su ciudad.

America's most popular pulps&#x2014;Dime Detective, Black Mask, and Detective Fiction Weekly&#x2014;published hundreds of his stories. Classic films like Hitchcock's Rear Window, Truffaut's The Bride Wore Black and Mississippi Mermaid, Tournier's Black Alibi, and Siodmak's Phantom Lady, as well as dozens of other movies, were based on his work. Novels like Deadline at Dawn, Rendezvous in Black, and Night Has a Thousand Eyes have won him the epithet "father of noir." Every one of the countless many who have read and loved the work of Cornell Woolrich will welcome and applaud this publication of a new collection of tales&#x2014;the first in nearly two decades&#x2014;by the greatest writer of suspense fiction in the twentieth century. Woolrich lived a life of such deep despair and utter terror that he could do little except put those fears onto the printed page. In the masterfully wrought suspense of this volume's twenty stories, readers can enjoy works written at the height of Woolrich's powers, as well as many never before published in book form before now.</p><p></p><h2>Throne Of Glass Collectors Edition</h2><p>#1 New York Times bestselling author Sarah J.

From there, Zolotow carefully chooses her words to create a poem full of the colors, sounds, and sights of a day at the beach. The verbal description is firmly framed within oceans of white space on the left and matched by the equally well-crafted gouache and watercolor paintings on the right. Minor's softly detailed photoreal renderings use the perspective of a gull to capture the vastness of the sea and sky as well as that of sandpipers running along the shore to denote precision of movement. Zolotow's words are so descriptive that the paintings seem almost redundant. They do work together to reinforce the gentle mood of the quiet story so that readers, like the boy, can close their eyes and be there too. --Judith Gloyer, Milwaukee Public Library<br>Copyright 1992 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Water Paper Paint: Exploring Creativity with Watercolor and Mixed Media</h2><p><p>This book is not only for "painters" but for all types of creative individuals who want to experience and play with watercolor, whether their background is mixed-media, textile art, journaling, or paper craft.

He was very hungry as usual. Once, he had even been hungry the day after he finished eating a whale.</p><p>SOME STORIES ARE TOO BIG to be told all at once, even if they seem small. Largeness of story has nothing to do with the length of each word or of each sentence or with the number of pages, but with the capacity of the heart, which can take only so much.</p><p>This is such a story.</p><p>It begins in a little-known corner of Alaska less than two decades after the end of the Klondike Gold Rush, one of America&#x2019;s last great adventures. Back then, there stood a small village at the northern edge of a great lake surrounded on the south side by mountains and fed by a glacier. A fast-running river flows from the far eastern side of the lake. Indeed, the name for the river in the local indigenous language, Tazlina, means &#x201c;swift river.&#x201d;</p><p>Don&#x2019;t bother to look for the village on a map; you won&#x2019;t find it.</p><p>The People had lived in this country forever, not forever in the sense that a farming family that has lived on the same farm for generations would use the word, but so long as to give depth and width and the smell of age to the word.</p><p>More than two dozen families dwelled in small log houses at the edge of the lake. They weren&#x2019;t very tall houses, for they were built partially into the ground, which had the benefit of cooling them in summer and warming them in winter. The roofs were covered with sod, the heavy soil insulating the homes. They were abloom with weeds and wildflowers. And every green roof was adorned with weathered, gray caribou and moose antlers&#x2014;some very large, for game was plentiful in those days.</p><p>Smoke from cooking fires rose and drifted through the village, helping to drive away mosquitoes, the plague of summertime, from which there was no true escape. Racks made of willow were laden with strips of red salmon hanging to dry in the sun and wind. Little houses on tall legs stood back in the forest of black spruce. These caches, accessible only by ladder, stored dried fish and meat out of the reach of animals.</p><p>Canoes were pulled up on the gravel beach. At the western edge of the village, a thin footbridge made of a fallen timber spanned a clear stream, which was full of bright red salmon. Dogs ran about barking and sniffing and searching for something to eat. Children helped their families&#x2014;sons helping fathers and uncles, daughters helping mothers and aunts&#x2014;or they chased the dogs along the beach or skipped rocks on the water.</p><p>In such a small village, everyone was somehow related. But on such a harsh land the amity of other villages was important. In time of famine, when the great herds of caribou did not come into the country during winter, that sense of wider community could mean the difference between life and death. Sharing in time of need is paramount in the north, where snow and quiet and darkness rule the land for half a year at a time. It is one of the most essential laws.</p><p>It was in this village that the story begins.</p><p>But it does not end there.</p><p>Several spear-holding men were standing knee-deep in the stream as it widened and shallowed, emptying into the lake. The bottom of the creek was sand and pebbles, where salmon congregated and readied themselves for their final push upstream, up to the headwater that would welcome their spawn&#x2014;life arising from death as day arises from night; such is the cycle of existence.</p><p>The men stabbed salmon with the long, barbed spears, flinging them ashore to their wives, who deftly cut them open and tossed the innards back into the water so that the spirits of the salmon could return to the sea. It was important that the People respect the salmon, which they depended on to outlast the long, desolate winters. If the salmon spirits thought they had been disrespected, they might not return in the future.</p><p>Two eagles watched everything from the treetops. Seagulls hovered and mewed above the women, diving and fighting one another for whatever was flung into the moving water, and far out on the lake, ducks floated on the shimmering blue-gray surface. Even farther, on the distant horizon, the white glacier crept in the distance.</p><p>Upstream from the men was the little footbridge, and upstream of that stood two young girls, sisters&#x2014;the older and taller on the right bank, the younger girl perched precariously on a large rock midstream, several other large rocks protruding from the water behind her.</p><p>&#x201c;Jump!&#x201d; shouted Millie from the bank. &#x201c;You can make it!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;But I can&#x2019;t!&#x201d; Maura shouted above the din of the rushing water. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll fall in!&#x201d;</p><p>Maura had jumped from one rock to another, but now the distance to shore seemed too great.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re always afraid of everything!&#x201d; shouted Millie. She was impatient because her mother had asked her to fetch her younger sister. Mother would be angry at her for taking so long, even though it was Maura&#x2019;s fault they were late. She had stood on the boulder for a long time, too frightened to leap. But that wouldn&#x2019;t matter. Millie was older; it was she who would be blamed.</p><p>&#x201c;I am not,&#x201d; replied Maura quietly, barely audible above the rushing water, almost losing her footing on the slippery rock.</p><p>But it was true. Maura wouldn&#x2019;t even go to the outhouse alone after dark. She always made her sister go with her, and she always sang a little song while inside, her heels nervously tapping against the boards.</p><p>Running past Millie, a lean dog chased a squirrel up a tree and then peered eagerly into the limbs, barking at the chattering escapee. It wasn&#x2019;t their dog. Dozens of dogs roamed the village.</p><p>&#x201c;Hurry up and jump!&#x201d; Millie shouted. &#x201c;Mother said to come home!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;ll fall in,&#x201d; replied Maura, almost in tears, thinking of the swift, icy water.</p><p>Millie reached out her hand. &#x201c;Grab hold when you jump! I&#x2019;ll catch you!&#x201d;</p><p>Maura crouched, not nearly low enough, and jumped, landing in water up to her waist. Salmon darted from beneath and about her, splashing every which way up and down the stream, the way they do when wading bears try to pounce on them. Maura stood only a step from shore crying, the ends of her long black hair floating around her.</p><p>Millie leaned forward and helped her little sister out of the stream. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too frightened. You really must grow up.&#x201d; Her tone was stern, in a motherly sort of way, though she was only three years older. Millie even looked like their mother. Maura took after their father.</p><p>Maura stopped crying as she walked behind Millie on the narrow trail to their house, her dress dripping. Mosquitoes buzzed about them; the squirrel-chasing dog followed on their heels, stopping often to mark bushes and trees.</p><p>&#x201c;But I&#x2019;m only ten,&#x201d; she said quietly, feeling a little ashamed of herself.</p><p>&#x201c;At your age, I was swimming in the lake,&#x201d; Millie said over her shoulder. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re too afraid even to wade in the stream.&#x201d;</p><p>Maura didn&#x2019;t say anything for several steps but finally managed, &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t help it if I&#x2019;m small.&#x201d;</p><p>As she walked, Maura stretched her stride to match the prints left by her sister&#x2019;s moccasins on the sandy trail.</p><p>Millie stopped and turned to Maura. &#x201c;The badger is small, but even the mighty bear fears him.&#x201d;</p><p>Neither of the girls said a word after that. The mosquitoes continued to buzz, and the dog ran off after another squirrel.</p><p>When they entered their small house, their mother was cooking fish-egg soup over an open fire, adding wild potatoes to the black cast-iron pot. The inside of the house was smoke-filled and crowded, consisting of a single room with two beds mounted along the hewn-log walls. A small table stood under the only window in the cabin. Now, at midday, the table was bare, except for an unlit candle and a box of matches. Two rickety chairs flanked the table&#x2019;s end, though it served a family of four.</p><p>No art adorned the walls, no pictures of any kind, no photographs. There were no books, no fine china, no dolls or other playthings of any sort, no cupboards or toilets or closets. The floor was earthen but clean-swept. A lever-action rifle leaned in a corner below a dozen traps hanging from nails, a box of cartridges on the floor beneath it. On one wall hung three beaver pelts and a great many smaller muskrat and marten furs; on the opposite wall hung two wolf hides. The home smelled of tanned leather and wood smoke. A large bear hide was stretched and nailed on a wall outside, dry and cracked from the sun and wind.</p><p>&#x201c;There you are,&#x201d; their mother said without turning.</p><p>Millie steeled herself for Mother&#x2019;s reaction.</p><p>&#x201c;I told you to go find your sister a long time ago. What took you so long? I had to gather the firewood and prepare the soup by myself.&#x201d;</p><p>Then Mother looked over her shoulder and saw that Maura was soaking wet.</p><p>&#x201c;What happened to her?&#x201d; she shouted at Millie.</p><p>Millie tried to explain that she couldn&#x2019;t find Maura at first, that she had finally seen her playing on the other side of the creek, and that when they crossed the creek above the bridge, her little sister had fallen into the water.</p><p>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s your responsibility to watch after your sister,&#x201d; Mother said sternly, stirring the pot with a rough, hand-carved wooden spoon. &#x201c;How many times have I told you that you must take care of her?&#x201d;</p><p>Millie looked at the earthen floor. She couldn&#x2019;t look at her mother&#x2019;s face, couldn&#x2019;t bear to see the disappointment wrinkling her forehead.</p><p>Millie hated looking after Maura. She wanted to sew and bead and sit with other older girls as they tanned moose and caribou hides for ...</p></p><h2>Feminist Literary Theory and Criticism: A Norton Reader</h2><p><p><strong>Sandra M.

Jung Institute of Zurich, she published widely on subjects including alchemy, dreams, fairy tales, personality types, and psychotherapy.</p><h2>Forever War, The</h2><p><p>Private William Mandella is a hero in spite of himself -- a reluctant conscript drafted into an elite military unit, and propelled through space and time to fight in a distant thousand-year conflict. He never wanted to go to war, but the leaders on Earth have drawn a line in the interstellar sand -- despite the fact that their fierce alien enemy is unknowable, unconquerable, and very far away. So Mandella will perform his duties without rancor and even rise up through the military's ranks . . . if he survives. But the true test of his mettle will come when he returns to Earth. Because of the time dilation caused by space travel the loyal soldier is aging months, while his home planet is aging centuries -- and the difference will prove the saying: you never can go home. . .</p></p><p>In the 1970s Joe Haldeman approached more than a dozen different publishers before he finally found one interested in <em>The Forever War</em>. The book went on to win both the Hugo and Nebula Awards, although a large chunk of the story had been cut out before it saw publication. Now Haldeman and Avon Books have released the definitive version of <em>The Forever War</em>, published for the first time as Haldeman originally intended. The book tells the timeless story of war, in this case a conflict between humanity and the alien Taurans. Humans first bumped heads with the Taurans when we began using collapsars to travel the stars. Although the collapsars provide nearly instantaneous travel across vast distances, the relativistic speeds associated with the process means that time passes slower for those aboard ship. For William Mandella, a physics student drafted as a soldier, that means more than 27 years will have passed between his first encounter with the Taurans and his homecoming, though he himself will have aged only a year. When Mandella finds that he can't adjust to Earth after being gone so long from home, he reenlists, only to find himself shuttled endlessly from battle to battle as the centuries pass. <em>--Craig E.

All well but unhappily married, these women sought freedom and fulfillment by reinventing themselves, between the 1870s and 1890s, as icons. At their fabled salons, they inspired the creativity of several generations of writers, visual artists, composers, designers, and journalists. Against a rich historical backdrop, Weber takes the reader into these women's daily lives of masked balls, hunts, dinners, court visits, nights at the opera or theater. But we see as well the loneliness, rigid social rules, and loveless, arranged marriages that constricted these women's lives. Proust, as a twenty-year-old law student in 1892, would worship them from afar, and later meet them and create his celebrated composite character for <i>The Remembrance of Things Past.</i></p><p>Caroline Weber is a professor of French and Comparative Literature at Barnard College, Columbia University; she has also taught at the University of Pennsylvania and Princeton. She is the author of&nbsp;<i>Queen of Fashion: What Marie-Antoinette Wore to the Revolution&nbsp;</i>(2006). She has written for&nbsp;<i>The New York Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i>,&nbsp;<i>Financial Times</i>,&nbsp;<i>London Review of Books</i>,&nbsp;<i>The Wall Street Journal</i>, and&nbsp;<i>New York&nbsp;</i>magazine.

Taking the animal kingdom as her theme this year, the hostess had directed her seventeen-hundred-odd guests to model their outfits on the illustrated works of the Comte de Buffon, an Enlightenment naturalist who had studied the &#x201c;denaturing&#x201d; effects of environmental change on the fauna.<br><br>In the great ceremonial courtyard that separated Mme de Sagan&#x2019;s <i>h�tel particulier</i> in the Faubourg Saint-Germain from the street, fifty footmen in powdered wigs and red-and-gold livery danced attendance on arriving guests, handing them down from carriages emblazoned with coats of arms and ushering them inside to an immense reception hall bathed in violet-tinged electric light. (The lady of the house judged &#x201c;Swan Edison lamps&#x201d;&#x2014;lightbulbs, still a relative rarity in Paris&#x2014;more festive than candles or gaslight.) After a Swiss guard announced them by name and by title, invitees swept up a white marble staircase lined with fifty more liveried footmen and an equal number of porphyry vases. Antique Aubusson carpets cushioned the ascent.<br><br>From the top of the stairs, guests entered an enfilade of magnificent formal reception rooms successively decorated � la Louis XVI, Louis XV, and Louis XIV, a sequence that gave visitors the impression of traveling back in time. In one salon hung antique Gobelins tapestries so precious that Mme de Sagan displayed them only once a decade. In a second reception room, the hand-carved boiseries had been gilded with fifty pounds of pure gold, while in a third, floor-to-ceiling mirrors lined the walls, in emulation of the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. Although the <i>h�tel </i>had previously belonged to Henry Thomas Hope, profligate owner of the Hope Diamond, its d�cor had grown even more opulent since its new proprietress had moved in. Tall and blond with patrician cheekbones and creamy white skin, the Princesse de Sagan, forty-six, liked to think she bore a striking resemblance to Marie Antoinette.<br><br>Dazzling though they were, the splendors of the Sagan residence paled beside the menagerie assembled there this evening: a hodgepodge of zoological curiosities defying the dictates of nature&#x2014;and culture. As denizens of the monde, the revelers were Paris&#x2019;s ordained exemplars of breeding and good taste. Tonight, however, they played against type, making a game of their fabled civility by masquerading as savage beasts.<br><br>At this so-called <i>bal des b�tes</i> (ball of the beasts) as at all <i>mondain </i>functions, the guests were attired with consummate chic, only on this occasion their elegance assumed weird, unsettling forms. Beneath their customary silk top hats, impeccably tailored clubmen&#x2014;members of such exclusive all-male Parisian social clubs as the Jockey and the Cercle de l&#x2019;Union&#x2014;sported oversized papier-m�ch� heads denoting insects and vermin, crustaceans and big game. To their own uniform of evening dresses and jewels, the women had added furs, masks, and exotic plumage. Statuesque Mme de Sagan, whose &#x201c;queen of the birds&#x201d; regalia included a gigantic feather-and-gem-covered mechanical tail that she could unfurl and retract at will, had gone so far as to perch a taxidermied peacock&#x2019;s head atop her own. Its diamond-studded eyes glittered eerily in the electric light.<br><br>With similarly macabre wit, slim, haughty-looking Comtesse Adh�aume de Chevign�, twenty-six, had tucked a dead snowy owl&#x2019;s head into her coif. The comtesse, a mythology buff, had dubbed herself &#x201c;the Friend of Minerva, Goddess of Wisdom [<i>Sagesse</i>],&#x201d; although her take on Minerva&#x2019;s avian mascot contradicted the other meaning of <i>sagesse</i>: &#x201c;decorousness&#x201d; or &#x201c;good behavior.&#x201d; On its own, Mme de Chevign�&#x2019;s dress of snow-white tulle and feathers might have exuded decorum, but the giant blood-red rubies sparkling in the eye-sockets of her owl&#x2019;s head told a different story. They were the eyes of a fiend, a devil, a good owl gone bad.<br><br>By design, this study in contrasts stressed the contradictory traits for which the comtesse, n�e Laure de Sade, was famed. She looked like a princess, with the same heavy-lidded blue eyes, silky blond tresses, and chiseled bone structure that the Italian poet Petrarch had cherished in her fourteenth-century ancestress and namesake, Laure de Noves, Comtesse Hugues de Sade. Yet she spoke like a peasant, in an antiquated backwoods drawl, and cursed like a stevedore, in the filthy patois of her other noted literary forebear, the Marquis de Sade. Added to her fondness for shooting, riding, and man-tailored clothing, her tough talk moved one of her friends to brand her &#x201c;Corporal Petrarch.&#x201d; This sobriquet underlined the antitheses Mme de Chevign� somehow managed to embrace: womanly and virile, sacred and profane.<br><br>Her bawdy posturing and provocative &#x201c;mannish air,&#x201d; as another of her friends termed it, intrigued any number of <i>mondain </i>gallants, several of whom were suspected of enjoying Mme de Chevign�&#x2019;s favors in bed. The Sagan ball found her coquetting with one such admirer, Comte Joseph de Gontaut, despite the presence of both their spouses (and despite Gontaut&#x2019;s goofy attire: he was costumed as the hindquarters of a giraffe; two of his kinsmen represented the torso and head). As a rule, such brazen impropriety did not go over well in the gratin, where extramarital affairs were tolerated on the condition that they be conducted in secret. Strangely enough, however, Mme de Chevign�&#x2019;s insubordinate antics endeared her to many of society&#x2019;s grandest figures: crowned heads weary of the joyless formality that necessarily attended their station. To these exalted persons, the young noblewoman&#x2019;s affronts to <i>bon ton</i> came as thrilling novelties, like s�ances or telephones.<br><br>The patronage of her high-placed friends allowed Mme de Chevign� to laugh off what she herself saw as her most shameful feature&#x2014;her relatively modest means&#x2014;by avowing that she was &#x201c;poor in income, but rich in highnesses.&#x201d; When society wags speculated that the rubies in her owl&#x2019;s head were presents from a Romanov grand duchess, she neither confirmed nor denied the provenance. But in another virtuoso display of cheek, she disparaged her presumed benefactor&#x2019;s good taste. After relating an anecdote about a different Romanov gift&#x2014;a sturgeon stuffed with turquoises&#x2014;she shrugged her shoulders at the tackiness and concluded, &#x201c;Anyhow, I have <i>been </i>to Tsarskoe Selo, and it is <i>not as chic as all that</i>!&#x201d; Lines like these were Mme de Chevign�&#x2019;s masterstrokes. To receive special tokens of a highness&#x2019;s esteem was impressive enough; to scoff at them was downright awe inspiring.<br><br>The comtesse flirted with the giraffe&#x2019;s behind until a hummingbird with diamond-speckled wings broke up the colloquy, pulling her aside for a whispered exchange. This interruption restored Gontaut to his fellow giraffe components, who were enjoying their collective stature as the biggest brute at the party. Having heard rumors of another guest&#x2019;s intention to show up in an elephant suit, they were relieved to discover that their hostess had vetoed the plan at the last minute, citing the risk of damage to the Old Master frescoes on the ceilings of her <i>h�tel</i>.<br><br>The princesse had also declared a ban on fish costumes, reasoning that guests thus attired would inevitably want to swim, and she couldn&#x2019;t guarantee them a suitably warm water temperature in her (presumably capacious) aquarium. This caveat hadn&#x2019;t deterred one vixen from decking herself out as a salmon, in a curve-hugging hot-pink mermaid ensemble patently designed to draw stares. Unfortunately, this woman&#x2019;s dress attracted further notice because another femme fatale, known to her peers as &#x201c;the Blond Cleopatra,&#x201d; happened to be wearing a skin-tight ibis outfit of a nearly identical hue. The two fuchsia sirens eyed each other charily in the park-sized gardens behind the mansion, where Swan Edison lamps sparkled by the thousands in the old-growth chestnut trees.<br><br>Indoors, tension simmered between a portly duchess and a slender vicomtesse, both of whom had elected to appear <i>en panth�re</i>. Despite her rival&#x2019;s superior rank, the Vicomtesse Greffulhe, twenty-five, held the undisputed advantage. With her regal carriage, willowy frame, swanlike neck, and huge dark eyes the color of crushed pansies, �lisabeth Greffulhe, n�e Riquet de Caraman-Chimay, was one of Parisian society&#x2019;s most celebrated beauties. Her contemporaries routinely compared her to Venus, the goddess of love, and to Diana, the chaste, ethereal goddess of the moon and the hunt. The matronly Duchesse de Bisaccia recalled no such deities. Onlookers joked that the only thing funnier than the contrast between the thin and fat panthers was the discrepancy between Mme de Bisaccia&#x2019;s disgruntled mien and her family&#x2019;s heraldic motto: &#x201c;The pleasure is mine&#x201d; (<i>C&#x2019;est mon plaisir</i>).<br><br>The pleasure should have been Mme Greffulhe&#x2019;s. Yet she gave no sign of savoring her victory, beyond the chilly Mona Lisa smile that so often played upon her lips. As one of her relatives noted, &#x201c;She was beautiful always and everywhere. But her life was by no means a picnic&#x2014;it was no laughing matter to be the most beautiful woman in Paris.&#x201d; By her own admission, the vicomtesse&#x2019;s prime objective in every circumstance was to project &#x201c;an image of prestige like none other.&#x201d; To achieve this effect, she was partial to fashions that provoked shock and awe, and tonight was no exception. More often than not, she went in for variations on an ice-queen aesthetic, consistent with her reputation for spotless virtue. (<i>Her </i>family motto was &#x201c;Piety stands with me&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Juvat pietas</i>&#x2014;to the despair of many an enamored clubman.) But for the <i>bal des b�tes</i>, she had morphed into something elemental and wild. Eschewing the evening dress that subtended the other beasts&#x2019; costumes, she had swathed herself in only a whispery white chemise, overlain with a genuine panther skin. Her lustrous chestnut-brown curls, sprinkled with pieces of jet, spilled loose over her shoulders.<br><br>Mme Greffulhe&#x2019;s outfit was all the more arresting in that she had based it not, as the other guests had done, on imagery from Buffon but on one of the treasures of the Louvre&#x2019;s permanent collection: Leonardo da Vinci&#x2019;s <i>John the Baptist</i>. Along with her beauty, the trait on which she most prided herself was her passion for the arts, and she was infamous for lording it over her peers. Her <i>John the Baptist</i> garb typified her high-cultural pretensions, which she believed set her apart from the rest of the gratin. The details of her costume indicated a careful study of Leonardo&#x2019;s painting, from the artful drape of the panther&#x2019;s hide to the curtain of tumbling dark hair, to say nothing of the chilly Mona Lisa smile.<br><br>At the same time, her costume raised questions about her rationale for choosing that particular work as her prototype; for Leonardo&#x2019;s John is a comely androgyne, endowed with the features of a young man thought to have been the artist&#x2019;s lover. On a tomboy like Laure de Chevign�, such gender-bending attire would have been equally audacious&#x2014;cross-dressing had another few decades to go before it would become a mainstay of society costume balls&#x2014;but at least it would have been consistent with her &#x201c;mannish air.&#x201d; On �lisabeth Greffulhe, the guise made less sense. Whatever speculation it drew from her peers, the logic behind it remained her own tantalizing little secret.<br><br>Meanwhile, the visual clash between the two panthers had caught the eye of a little frog looking on from the sidelines, a dark-eyed, olive-skinned newcomer to the monde. Always quick with a joke, the frog took the dueling panther getups as a pretext to crack jokes to her companions: a trio of Rothschild heiresses arrayed as a leopard, a bat, and a bright orange tropical bird. It was then that the frog, mocking the duchesse-panther&#x2019;s heft, first made what would become one of her best-known witticisms, though years of subsequent requoting and revision would transform the fearsome jungle predator into a bland farmyard herbivore. &#x201c;She isn&#x2019;t a cow,&#x201d; ran the final version of the sally, still circulating in the Faubourg a full generation later. &#x201c;She&#x2019;s an entire herd!&#x201d;<br><br>If such put-downs passed in Parisian society for the height of cleverness, they also disclosed the undercurrent of malice that subtended the nobility&#x2019;s polish, making that class itself a peculiar hybrid species: part gleaming tooth, part gory claw. At the <i>bal des b�tes</i>, this duality surfaced with arresting clarity when the blast of a hunting horn abruptly turned a pack of human staghounds loose in the mansion. Outfitted in dog masks and hunting pinks, the baying creatures raced on all fours across gleaming marble and parquet floors, in hot pursuit of a fleet-footed human stag.<br><br>While the outcome of the chase has been lost to history, the scene revealed something essential about its participants. Like the sport it mimicked, this faux stag hunt was a form of ritualized violence, a stylized rechanneling of the latent hostility the French courtier class had once felt toward the king. It was no accident that before he turned a modest royal hunting lodge into the seat of the most magnificent court in Europe, Louis XIV (1638&#x2013;1715) had come of age at a time when noblemen resentful of the monarchy&#x2019;s absolutist pretensions waged civil war against the throne, nearly toppling it. To forestall any further such sedition, the young sovereign ingeniously transposed his vassals&#x2019; bloodlust into an arena that he alone could define and control: court ceremony.<br><br>Some of the activities that fell under this rubric, such as the royal hunt and the <i>ballet de cour</i>, were strenuous enough to provide a physical outlet for the courtiers&#x2019; aggression. But the Sun King (a persona Louis cultivated by playing the role of the sun in some early court pageants) also addressed this threat more abstractly, by subjecting his retinue at Versailles to an intricate system of etiquette in which nearly every gesture and word bespoke their place in the court hierarchy. When the members of the court gathered each day to watch the king dine, which of them had the right to sit in his presence, and within that tiny �lite, who was accorded a stool and who a proper chair? Did a French duke walk into a room ahead of a legitimized royal bastard (Louis XIV had plenty of those) or behind him? To whom did the prerogative of initiating or ending a conversation belong? Who had the privilege of carrying the monarch&#x2019;s candlestick when escorting him to bed, or of removing the royal riding boot from the royal foot after a long, sweaty day in the royal stirrup? The Sun King&#x2019;s genius lay in convincing the members of his court to treat these seeming trivial questions as matters of (symbolic) life and death. By this means, he trained his nobles to envy one another, rather than him, so deflecting from the crown whatever hostile energies might not be exorcised by shooting and dancing alone.<br><br>As at the fin de si�cle, a century&#x2019;s worth of roiling political upheaval having finally dethroned Louis&#x2019;s royal heirs, the Bourbons (along with their archrival cousins, the d&#x2019;Orl�ans, and the self-made imperial Bonapartes), the French nobility retained an atavistic taste for pomp and circumstance. But the target of its rancor had changed. Instead of an all-powerful king, its most formidable rival now was the bourgeoisie&#x2014;well educated, high achieving, and, in this industrializing age, increasingly rich. Over the past half century, this demographic had asserted its might in virtually every area that counted: ...</p><h2>Explode the Code 8: Essential Lessons for Phonics Mastery</h2><p>explode the code book 8 second edition</p><p></p><h2>Shadowfever</h2><p>MacKayla Lane was just a child when she and her sister, Alina, were given up for adoption and banished from Ireland forever. <br> <br>Twenty years later, Alina is dead and Mac has returned to the country that expelled them to hunt her sister&#x2019;s murderer.

At the heart of the book is The Save Yourself Plan: a streamlined five-month program that delivers genuine long-term financial security.

Orman's direct, non-condescending style is perfect for this subject matter--she begins with the premise that "Women can invest, save, and handle debt as well and skillfully as any man" and then tackles the important question--"So why don't they?" Designed to educate and inspire, <i>Women &amp; Money</i> also offers a "Save Yourself Plan," a five-month program that "delivers genuine long-term financial security." Want to know more?

I never thought it was necessary. So then why am I doing just that in my eighth book? And why now? Let me explain. All my previous books were written with the belief that gender is not a factor on any level in mastering the nuts and bolts of smart financial management. Women can invest, save, and handle debt just as well and skillfully as any man. I still believe that--why would anyone think differently? So imagine my surprise when I learned that some of the people closest to me in my life were in the dark about their own finances. Clueless. Or, in some cases, willfully resisting doing what they knew needed to be done. I'm talking about smart, competent, accomplished women who present a face to the world that is pure confidence and capability. Do you mean to tell me that I, Suze Orman, who make my living solving the financial problems of total strangers, couldn't spot the trouble brewing so close to home? I don't think I'm blind; I just think that these women became very, very good at hiding their troubles from me.Why not?

Why did the crew steam full speed ahead into dangerous waters despite six wireless warnings? How able was the doomed behemoths superb seaman Captain Smith? Why did the nearby ship Californian ignore Titanics distress signals? How could such a disaster ever have occurred?<p>Author Walter Lords acclaimed classic <em><strong>A Night to Remember</strong></em> is considered the definitive written work on the TITANIC tragedy. And now he returns to the scene of chaos and horror to explore--and answer--the untold mysteries behind the twentieth centurys greatest catastrophe at sea.</p></p><p>You might say that Walter Lord provoked the whole <i>Titanic</i> mania by interviewing dozens of survivors and fashioning their reminiscences into the classic non-fiction novel <i>A Night to Remember</i>, which was made into a 1958 film that heavily influenced James Cameron's 1998 epic. Some of the dialogue is more vivid than the 1998 film--when a kid sees the deadly iceberg, he says excitedly, "Oh, Muddie, look at the beautiful North Pole with no Santa Claus on it."<p> But much has been discovered since Lord's original book made waves--such as the shipwreck itself, and a wealth of scientific inquiry. So he wrote this semisequel, which tackles each of the remaining mysteries about the unnecessary calamity in a methodical, but quite readable, fashion. How come the wireless operators blew it so fatally? Maybe they would have had better operators if they paid them more than $5 a week--as Lord notes, it would have taken a wireless operator 18 years to earn one transatlantic ticket. How come the <i>Californian</i> just sat there in nearby waters and neglected to save anyone on the frantically signaling and flare-firing <i>Titanic</i>? Lord quotes a man on the nonsinking ship admitting to "a certain amount of slackness," which he uses for a sardonic chapter title.</p><p> Some of the characters are more sympathetic, such as Renee Harris, who used the money she won suing the <i>Titanic</i> owners for her husband's death to bankroll neophyte playwright Moss Hart's first show. Lord says that Hart's memoir, <i>Act One</i>, depicts Harris reacting to an opening-night flop with optimism. After you've survived the <i>Titanic</i>, what's to worry?</p><p> Walter Lord has gotten better reviews, and he needn't fret about his reputation. The Pulitzer Prize-winning historian Barbara Tuchman, author of <i>A Distant Mirror</i>, had this reaction to <i>Night Lives On</i>: "Stunning ... his detection and discoveries make a first-class historical reconstruction and a model in the research and writing of that difficult art." <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>Walter Lord received his B.A. in history from Princeton University in 1939. After war service in the OSS, he graduated from Yale Law School. His other books include A Night to Remember, Day of Infamy, The Good Years, A Time to Stand, Incredible Victory, The Dawn's Early Light, Lonely Vigil, and The Miracle of Dunkirk. He estimates that for every year of writing, he spends two in research.<p>Charles Keating has been nominated for both the Tony and Emmy Awards.

When James began screaming out recurring phrases like, "Plane on fire! Little man can't get out!" the Leiningers finally admitted that they truly <em>had</em> to take notice. <br><br>When details of planes and war tragedies no two-year-old boy could know continued-- even in stark daylight-- Bruce and Andrea Leininger began to realize that this was an incredible situation. SOUL SURVIVOR is the story of how the Leiningers pieced together what their son was communicating and eventually discovered that he was reliving the past life of World War II fighter pilot James Huston. As Bruce Leininger struggled to understand what was happening to his son, he also uncovered details of James Huston's life-- and death-- as a pilot that will fascinate military buffs everywhere.<br><br>In SOUL SURVIVOR, we are taken for a gripping ride as the Leiningers' belief system is shaken to the core, and both of these families come to know a little boy who, against all odds and even in the face of true skeptics, harbors the soul of this man who died long ago.</p><p>Bruce and Andrea Leininger, James&#39; parents, live in Louisiana with their son James, who is now nine years old.Do the nightmares of a Louisiana boy mean he is the reincarnation of a downed WWII pilot? His parents make a case for just such a phenomenon as they detail their investigation into the facts behind his dreams. Paul Boehmer&#39;s tone is a little too astonished at times as he talks about James Leininger&#39;s obsession with airplanes and his uncanny knowledge of the details of a pilot&#39;s life. At the same time, though, Boehmer brings humanity to the story as he talks about the pilot&#39;s sister and surviving comrades. Whether or not listeners believe in reincarnation, Bruce Leininger&#39;s research casts an important light on the lives and deaths of the flyers who figure in his son&#39;s dreams. J.A.S. � AudioFile 2009, Portland, Maine</p><h2>Eisenhower: A Soldier&#39;s Life</h2><p>From the bestselling author of <i>Patton: A Genius for War</i> comes a compelling new account of the transformation of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, from apprehensive soldier to one of our greatest heros.<br><br>In the weeks leading up to D-Day, Dwight D. Eisenhower seethed with nervous energy. He had not expected his military career to bring him to this moment. The son of pacifists, Ike graduated from high school more likely to teach history than to make it. Casting new light on this profound evolution, <i>Eisenhower</i> chronicles the unlikely, dramatic rise of the supreme Allied commander. <br><br>Beginning with the lasting effect of Eisenhower's impoverished youth, bestselling biographer Carlo D'Este follows his subject through West Point and a sometimes troubled marriage; toil under MacArthur in the Philippines during the 1930s; the inner sanctums of the War Department; the general's painful North African apprenticeship; and, finally, the dramatic events leading to the Allied victory in May 1945.<br><br>Exposing for the first time numerous myths that have surrounded the war hero and his family (such as his romance with his wartime driver, Kay Summersby), D'Este also probes Eisenhower's famous clashes with his American peers and the British chiefs of staff, as well as his relations with legendary figures, including Winston Churchill and George S. Patton.<br><br>Unlike other biographies of the general, <i>Eisenhower</i> captures Ike's true character, from his youth to the pinnacle of his career and afterward. <br></p><p>There is hardly a shortage of books about Dwight Eisenhower, but Carlo D'Este's <i>Eisenhower: A Soldier's Life</i> stands tall in this forest by virtue of the author's insistence on a too-often forgotten rule of biographers: show--don't tell about--the subject. Though D'Este doesn't neglect Eisenhower's early years (his sketch of the man's rambunctious West Point years is hearteningly entertaining), the book concentrates on his military career, including his years of treading water in the Philippines. By far the most trenchant sections, however, deal with World War II (including a keen look at the little-discussed North African campaign.) We see Ike, who had a famous temper and, when angry, a most indelicate vocabulary, chain-smoking cigarettes and unable to sleep in the weeks leading to D-day; refusing--out of disgust for German atrocities--to be present at the signing of the articles of surrender; bantering, though his heart was heavy, with enlisted men; wrestling contentiously with MacArthur and Field Marshall Montgomery. We read excerpts of his letters to Mamie and are privy to, perhaps, his laying the groundwork for a political career. <i>A Soldier's Life</i>, long but brisk, sympathetic but not adoring, rigorous but never tedious, is a commendable biography. <i>--H. O'Billovich</i>Carlo D'Este, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant colonel and a distinguished military historian, is the author of <i>Patton: A Genius for War</i> and three other books on World War II, all of which received high praise.

In &#x201c;Tom Hickathrift,&#x201d; a little, poor person gets the better of a gigantic, wealthy one. In &#x201c;The Man Without a Heart,&#x201d; a man learns about the value of basic labor after testing out more privileged lives. And in &#x201c;The Political Economist and the Flowers,&#x201d; two contrasting gardeners highlight the cold heart of Darwinian competition. Rosen&#x2019;s informative introduction describes how such tales advocated for contemporary progressive causes and countered the dominant celebration of Britain&#x2019;s imperial values. The book includes archival illustrations, biographical notes about the writers, and details about the periodicals where the tales first appeared.</p><p>Provocative and enlightening, <i>Workers&#x2019; Tales</i> presents voices of resistance that are more relevant than ever before.</p></p><p><b>Michael Rosen</b> is professor of children&#x2019;s literature at Goldsmiths, University of London.

The Soviets wouldn&#39;t let anyone travel so everything she learnt about the world came from her parents&#39; battered old atlas. An acclaimed novelist and award-winning graphic designer, she has spent years creating this, her own imaginative atlas of the world&#39;s loneliest places. These islands are so difficult to reach that until the late 1990s more people had set foot on the moon than on Peter I Island in the Antarctic. On one page are perfect maps, on the other unfold bizarre stories from the history of the islands themselves. Rare animals and strange people abound: from marooned slaves to lonely scientists, lost explorers to confused lighthouse keepers, mutinous sailors to forgotten castaways; a collection of Robinson Crusoes of all kinds. Recently awarded the prize of Germany&#39;s most beautiful book, the &#34;Atlas of Remote Islands&#34; is an intricately designed masterpiece that will delight maplovers everywhere. Judith Sch</p><p>Judith Schalansky is a writer and designer, and lectures on typography in Potsdam. She has written a novel and a typographic compendium, Fraktur mon Amour (2006) which has won several design prizes. She lives in Berlin.For those who find it difficult to believe that there are still isolated, secluded, and uninhabited or sparsely populated pockets of land anchored firmly in the midst of the Arctic, Atlantic, Indian, Pacific, and Antarctic Oceans, this quietly beautiful and subtly evocative book is a must read. Firm in her conviction that atlases should take a much-deserved place in the literary pantheon and that there is &#x201c;no more poetic book in the world,&#x201d; her cartographic drawings are accompanied by compelling narratives, outlining the history, natural science, local lore, and legend of each of the 50 islands she visually and textually conjures up out of her impeccable research and vivid imaginings. An armchair traveler&#x2019;s delight, this book will also beckon, challenge, and inspire intrepid explorers and exotically inclined vacationers. --Margaret Flanagan</p><h2>Jane Eyre (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics Series)</h2><p>&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LDIV&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RJane Eyre&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R, by &amp;&amp;LB&amp;&amp;RCharlotte Bronte&amp;&amp;L/B&amp;&amp;R, is part of the &amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;RBarnes &amp; Noble Classics&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;R&amp;&amp;LI&amp;&amp;R&nbsp;&amp;&amp;L/I&amp;&amp;Rseries, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

It's a family habit of ours, learned early on.</p><p>My first memory is of waving good-bye to Dad on our sun-drenched lawn one Sunday morning a hundred yards north of the sparkling lake. I was two. Dad piled into a car bound for Madison, Wisconsin, where he would be a guinea pig for a potential cure for tuberculosis. The year was 1959.</p><p>Why did he leave me there? Where was he going? Would he come back?</p><p>A childhood friend of his from Whittemore, Iowa, Lloyd Roth, head of the department of pharmacology at the University of Chicago, was working on this project at the Veterans Administration hospital. Roth was also a physicist and had worked on the Manhattan Project, which developed the atomic bomb.</p><p>Dad had picked up TB during World War II while stationed in Sicily with the Army Air Corps. He was a captain in charge of a supply depot at an air base; it's a wonder the planes could fly because he didn't know a screw from a screwdriver. The disease didn't fully manifest itself until after the war. When it did, more than a decade later, our family was in quarantine in Storm Lake, Iowa, a meatpacking town of about seven thousand with a small college and, yes, a lake.</p><p>There we were, Mom alone with six kids, I the youngest.</p><p>Brother Bill let loose hamsters in the basement that spread throughout the house.</p><p>Brother Jim and I painted the basement red&#x2014;including the clothes and bedding drying in the furnace room.</p><p>Brother Tom, the eldest, tore the screen doors off the Corral Drive-In theater with a beery buddy.</p><p>Brother John wanted to run away.</p><p>Sister Ann was taking care of me, after a fashion.</p><p>Mom called Dad in the hospital hoping for sympathy. He laughed.</p><p>They took out a lung and he wasn't supposed to last more than a few months. He made it fourteen years, just long enough for me not to understand him.</p><p>Meantime, Mom had been battling the VA ever since the war ended, trying to get him promised benefits. The records building in St. Louis burned down and with it the evidence that Dad contracted TB while in service.</p><p>She had been through an endless siege for information before. Her first husband and father of my oldest brother, Tom, Omer Kelly, was shot to death in a Chicago bar when Tom was about two. Mom spent years trying to find out how he died. Her father, Art Murray, traveled from Bancroft, Iowa, to Chicago with his lawyer, Luke Linnan, to find justice. Linnan had an old friend who was a judge there.

It gets flooded and scorched and comes back. No matter what you do for the next ten years, it comes back. It demands you pay heed to it, heel to it, nurture it, and hope for it.

For years, theater director Bryan Doerries has led an innovative public health project that produces ancient tragedies for current and returned soldiers, addicts, tornado and hurricane survivors, and a wide range of other at-risk people in society. <br><br>Drawing on these extraordinary firsthand experiences, Doerries clearly and powerfully illustrates the redemptive and therapeutic potential of this classical, timeless art: how, for example, <i>Ajax</i> can help soldiers and their loved ones better understand and grapple with PTSD, or how <i>Prometheus Bound </i>provides new insights into the modern penal system. These plays are revivified not just in how Doerries applies them to communal problems of today, but in the way he translates them himself from the ancient Greek, deftly and expertly rendering enduring truths in contemporary and striking English.<br> &nbsp;<br> The originality and generosity of Doerries&#x2019;s work is startling, and <i>The Theater of War</i>&#x2014;wholly unsentimental, but intensely felt and emotionally engaging&#x2014;is a humane, knowledgeable, and accessible book that will both inspire and enlighten. Tracing a path that links the personal to the artistic to the social and back again, Doerries shows us how suffering and healing are part of a timeless process in which dialogue and empathy are inextricably linked.</p></p><p><b>BRYAN DOERRIES</b>&nbsp;is a writer, director, and translator. He is the founder of Theater of War, a project that presents readings of ancient Greek plays to service members, veterans, and their families to help them initiate conversations about the visible and invisible wounds of war. He is also the co-founder of Outside the Wire, a social-impact company that uses theater and a variety of other media to address pressing public health and social issues, such as combat-related psychological injury, end-of-life care, prison reform, domestic violence, political violence, recovery from natural and man-made disasters, and addiction. A self-described &#x201c;evangelist&#x201d; for classical literature and its relevance to our lives today, Doerries uses age-old approaches to help individuals and communities heal after suffering and loss.9780307959454|excerpt<br><br>Doerries / THEATER OF WAR<br><br>Learning Through Suffering<br><br>I<br><br>In the fall of fourth grade, I landed a small role in a production of Euripides&#x2019; Medea at the local community college in Newport News, Virginia, where my father taught experimental psychology. I played one of the ill-fated boys slaughtered at the hand of their pathologically jealous mother. I can still remember my one line, which I belted backstage with abandon as several drama majors pretended to bludgeon me with long wooden canes behind a black velvet curtain&#x2014;&#x201c;No, no, the sword is falling!&#x201d; The director, a short, fiery German auteur with spiky white hair and a black leather jacket always draped over his shoulders like a cape, would scream at the cast during rehearsals at the top of his lungs until we delivered our lines with the appropriate zeal. Whenever our performances reached the desired fever pitch, he would jump up from his chair and explode with delight, &#x201c;Now veeee are koooooking!&#x201d;<br><br>During daytime performances for local high school students, the boredom in the theater was as palpable as the thick layer of humidity generated by sweaty adolescents fidgeting in their seats, whispering and blowing spitballs in the shadows, waiting for the agony to end. Whenever I entered the stage, wearing a tight gold polyester tunic, which clung to my thighs and itched mercilessly under the unforgiving lights, I heard rippling waves of laughter move through the crowd. What&#x2019;s so funny? I wondered, squinting into the stage lights. After the show closed, at the cast party, one of my fellow actors confirmed that the laughter had, in fact, been at my expense. Unaccustomed to wearing a tunic, I had provided the high school audiences with an extended, full frontal view of my underwear while perched atop a large granite boulder. Seeing my Fruit of the Looms was likely the most memorable event in those students&#x2019; mandatory encounter with Euripides.<br><br>Most of us probably developed an allergy to ancient Greek drama in high school, when some well-intending English teacher required us to read plays like Oedipus the King, Antigone, Prometheus Bound, and The Oresteia in rigid Victorian translation, or forced us to watch seemingly endless films featuring British actors in loose-fitting sheets and golden sandals declaiming the vocative refrain &#x201c;O, Zeus!&#x201d; from behind masks. If your early encounters with the ancient Greeks zapped you of any ambition to ever pick up a play by Aeschylus, Sophocles, or Euripides again, you are not alone. Aeschylus is known for having written in his play Agamemnon that humans &#x201c;learn through suffering,&#x201d; but for most students, studying ancient Greek drama is just an exercise in suffering, with no apparent educational value.<br><br>Ironically, some scholars now suggest that attending the dramatic festivals in ancient Greece and watching plays by the great tragic poets served as an important rite of passage for late-adolescent males, known as ephebes. It is for this reason, according to the argument, that so many of the tragedies feature teenage characters&#x2014;such as Antigone, Pentheus, Neoptolemus, and Orestes&#x2014;thrust into ethically fraught situations with no easy answers and in which someone is likely to die. According to this understanding, tragedy may have been viewed as formalized training, preparing late adolescents for the ethical and emotional challenges of adult life, including military service and civic participation. In other words, the very plays that were designed thousands of years ago to educate and engage teenagers, to help transform them from children into productive citizens, have managed to bore them senseless for centuries.<br><br>One hope of this book is to administer an antidote to the obligatory high school unit on ancient Greek tragedy.<br><br>The first thing you learn in school about tragedy is that it tells the story of a good and prosperous individual who is brought to ruin by some defect in his or her character. This traditional reading of Greek tragedy goes something like this: Blinded by pride, or hubris, Oedipus ignores the warning of an oracle, unwittingly murders his father and sleeps with his mother, and&#x2014;though he manages to save the people of Thebes from the bloodthirsty Sphinx&#x2014;ultimately turns out to be the contagion that is plaguing his city. Conclusion: Oedipus was a great but flawed individual who was deluded by power and crushed by external forces beyond his grasp. We love stories about well-intentioned, flawed characters, because they make the most compelling drama. Also, as Aristotle pointed out, we take no pleasure in watching morally flawless people suffer.<br><br>But the ancient Greek word commonly translated in textbooks as &#x201c;flaw,&#x201d; hamartia, more accurately means &#x201c;error,&#x201d; from the verb hamartano, &#x201c;to miss the mark.&#x201d; Centuries later, by the time of the New Testament, the same word&#x2014;hamartia&#x2014;came to mean &#x201c;sin,&#x201d; fully loaded with all its moral judgment. In other words, tragedies depict characters making mistakes, rather than inherent flaws in character. I know that I miss the mark hundreds of times each day. I often have to lose my way in order to find the right path forward. Making mistakes, even habitually and unknowingly, is central to what it means to be human. Characters in Greek tragedies stray, err, and get lost. They are no more flawed than the rest of humanity; the difference lies in the scale of their mistakes, which inevitably cost lives and ruin generations.<br><br>At the same time, being human and making mistakes&#x2014;even in ignorance&#x2014;does not absolve these tragic characters of responsibility for their actions. Had they fully understood what they were doing, they most certainly wouldn&#x2019;t have done it. But they did it all the same. It is in this gray zone&#x2014;at the thin border between ignorance and responsibility&#x2014;that ancient Greek tragedies play out. This is one of the many reasons that tragedies still speak to us with undiminished force today. We all live in that gray zone, in which we are neither condemned by nor absolved of our mistakes.<br><br>What is so utterly flawed about the idea of the &#x201c;tragic flaw&#x201d; is that it encourages us to judge rather than to empathize with characters like Oedipus. Tragedies are designed not to teach us morals but rather to validate our moral distress at living in a universe in which many of our actions and choices are influenced by external powers far beyond our comprehension&#x2014;such as luck, fate, chance, governments, families, politics, and genetics. In this universe, we are dimly aware, at best, of the sum total of our habits and mistakes, until we have unwittingly destroyed those we love or brought about our own destruction.<br><br>It is not our job to judge the characters in Greek tragedies&#x2014;to focus on their &#x201c;flaws.&#x201d; Tragedy challenges us to see ourselves in the way its characters stray from the path, and to open our eyes to the bad habits we may have formed or to the mistakes we have yet to make. Contrary to what you may have learned in school, tragedies are not designed to fill us with pessimism and dread about the futility of human existence or our relative powerlessness in a world beyond our grasp. They are designed to help us see the impending disaster on the horizon, so that we may correct course and narrowly avoid it. Above all, the flaw in our thinking about tragedy is that we look for meaning where there is none to be found. Tragedies don&#x2019;t mean anything. They do something.<br><br>Another concept that gets drilled into our heads in high school is &#x201c;fate.&#x201d; The word for fate in ancient Greek&#x2014;moira&#x2014;means &#x201c;portion.&#x201d; In Greek antiquity, Fate was worshipped in the form of three goddesses: Clotho, the &#x201c;spinner&#x201d;; Lachesis, the &#x201c;allotter&#x201d;; and Atropos, the &#x201c;unturnable.&#x201d; Fate was older and more powerful than all the gods combined, and the entire cosmos was subject to its laws. No one lived above it or beyond it. Yet the Greek concept of fate, as it is encountered in Greek tragedy, is much subtler than many of us generally understand. In tragedy, the concept of fate is not mutually exclusive of the existence of free will; nor does the ancient idea of &#x201c;destiny&#x201d; negate the role of personal choice and human agency. In fact, as in the case of Oedipus, human choices and actions are required in order to fulfill an individual&#x2019;s fate or destiny.<br><br>In 1976, the year I was born, my father was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, an insidious, cruel disease that dismantled his mind and body slowly, almost imperceptibly, over a period of thirty-three years. In spite of the diagnosis, he adamantly refused to adjust his lifestyle, though he knew this choice would eventually come at a deadly cost. The nerves in his feet died first. Then the bones in his ankles collapsed. Then came the incurable lesions, the festering sores, the bouts of colitis, the kidney failure, the daily dialysis treatments, the kidney transplant, the septic infections, the endocarditis, the blindness, the dementia, the seizures, the horrifying hallucinations, and finally&#x2014;after much suffering&#x2014;a protracted, terrifying death, during which he believed a gaggle of black, ravenlike demons were swarming all around him, waiting to take his soul to hell.<br><br>The word diabetes comes from the Greek verb diabaino, &#x201c;to run through.&#x201d; The name derives from the signature symptoms of the disease, an unquenchable thirst combined with a constant need to urinate. Water &#x201c;runs through&#x201d; diabetics. The condition results from a deficiency in the pancreas, which normally produces insulin, a hormone that regulates sugar levels in the blood. Without enough insulin, sugars run wild, causing, among other symptoms, extreme thirst while steadily choking off the blood supply to nerves and tissues. Ultimately, over decades, the disease leaves no organ unscathed.<br><br>Type 2 diabetes is a fitting metaphor for the human condition as portrayed in ancient Greek tragedy, and for the interdependence of human action and fate. Those who are diagnosed with the disease often possess a genetic predisposition to develop it. It is written into their DNA, like an ancient intergenerational curse. And yet what diabetics choose to do with the knowledge of their condition has a direct impact upon their lives, and upon those who love them. Thus, in spite of the &#x201c;curse&#x201d; of their disease, diabetics still play a role in shaping their destiny. How they behave and the choices they make help determine the course their lives will take. Many are able to control their blood sugars through a combination of drugs, diet, and exercise, extending their life spans and delaying the progression of the disease for decades. But as many as 60 percent of type 2 diabetics do not adhere to the recommendations of their doctors or faithfully take their medication. This is primarily because diabetics do not experience the negative effects of eating junk food, not exercising, and allowing blood sugars to fluctuate for years. It is also because the medical regimen for most full-blown diabetics involves daily injections of insulin and constant monitoring of sugars with needle pricks to well-worn fingertips.<br><br>Fate refers to the cards we were dealt, the portion we were given at birth. Tragedy depicts how our choices and actions shape our destiny. No one ever said that change was easy, but my father believed it was impossible. He often told his experimental psychology students that when it comes to human behavior, what passes for change is no more than a fantasy, an illusion. This was his long-formed, heavily entrenched conviction, based on years of research, working with human beings and rats.<br><br>Nothing infuriated me more than to listen to him rationalize his own self-destruction with this specious argument. His unwillingness to acknowledge even the remote possibility of meaningful change fueled some of our worst fights and forever drove a wedge between us.<br><br>In the heat of one memorable argument, he eyed the collection of Sophocles&#x2019; plays I had under my arm and asked, &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you believe in fate, Bryan? All those Greek plays end in disaster, no matter what the characters try to do.&#x201d;<br><br>Like Oedipus, my father was adopted, but he wasn&#x2019;t told until much later, so he spent the entirety of his childhood believing that his adoptive parents were his biological parents. And like Oedipus, he discovered who his biological parents were near the end of his life, when it was too late to act upon this knowledge and avert his own self-destruction. In Sophocles&#x2019; version of the Oedipus myth, a Corinthian man, in a moment of inebriated indiscretion, accuses Oedipus of being a bastard, planting the seed that, decades later, bears fruit in the horrifying realization of his true identity. When my father turned sixteen, it was his grandmother, Hattie, who took him aside and casually, one might say cruelly, shattered his world by telling him he was adopted.<br><br>Decades later, while searching for a viable kidney donor for my father, we found out who his biological parents were. As fate would have it, they both worked at the Catholic hospital in Fairhaven, New Jersey, where he had been born. My father&#x2019;s father had been his pediatrician, a Spanish immigrant, who had indulged in an extramarital affair with a Puerto Rican nurse. My father&#x2019;s adoptive parents, who were in their forties and had been unable to conceive, were more than willing to help the physician and the nurse sweep their dalliance under the rug by taking the baby off their hands. Had it not been for my great-grandmother&#x2019;s loose lips, they might have perpetuated the myth that he was their son for the rest of their lives.<br><br>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Hispanic Americans are at a &#x201c;particularly high risk for type 2 diabetes.&#x201d; My father&#x2019;s fate, as it turned out, was something he could have, at the very least, deferred, had he investigated the identity of his biological parents. But like Oedipus, he did not really want to know the truth until it was too late. When Oedipus discovers who his parents were, he gouges out his eyes with golden pins from his mother&#x2019;s gown and stumbles off into the desert to die. My father drank a chocolate milk shake and slipped off into sugar-induced oblivion.<br><br>A week before my father died, frail and demented, at the age of sixty-six, I flew down from New York City to visit him at a nursing home in Virginia, a few blocks from where I had grown up. I brought him a chocolate milk shake from Monty&#x2019;s Penguin, the local diner we had frequented during my childhood. Though neither of us wanted to say goodbye, we both knew it was the last time we would see each other. After a long day of reminiscing and grappling with unanswerable questions, we eventually ran out of things to say.<br><br>The sun had already set, though I hadn&#x2019;t noticed its absence until after the room faded to black and the floodlights outside poured through cracks in the blinds, crisscrossing the floor. We sat in the darkness for an in�determinate time and looked at each other with understanding and regret. Finally, after my father closed his eyes and slipped back into semiconsciousness, I tossed my coat over my shoulder and slowly approached his bed, bending over to look at him one last time, to take in his face, so I wouldn&#x2019;t somehow forget its contours after he was gone.<br><br>Suddenly, without opening his eyes, he reached up and grabbed my arm, pulling me toward his face&#x2014;contorted in a rictus of horror&#x2014;with the desperation of a drowning victim. Clamping down with all his remaining strength, he sobbed: &#x201c;The same thing is going to happen to you, and to your brother! It&#x2019;s fate. It&#x2019;s fate!&#x201d;<br><br>It&#x2019;s his dementia talking, I told myself, not him. But it was also a curse.<br><br>As a child, I often spent afternoons observing him train his advanced psychology students in a small laboratory a few blocks from our house.

The editors of these handsome collections in the Poetry for Young People series have chosen well, bringing together about 20 of each great poet's most accessible, compelling poems, with selections that range from Coleridge's "The Rime of the Ancient Mariner" to Wordsworth's "I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud" and Yeats' stark, dramatic "An Irish Airman Foresees His Death." The full-color paintings on each page are beautiful. Each volume begins with a helpful general biography and a critical introduction to the poet's work. On the page with each poem, brief editorial notes provide useful context and guidance (if only the notes were at the back of the book, so that the reader could first enjoy a poem free of commentary). In fact, the book design is a problem, especially in the Yeats book. Harrington's impressionistic art is lush and beautiful, evoking the Irish landscapes, fantasy worlds, and stormy emotions of the verse; but the large pictures leave no space for readers to imagine what the words suggest, and much of the type is hard to read because it's printed right on the dark, full-page paintings. In the Coleridge and Wordsworth collections there is a lot more white space, and the illustrations evoke each poet's world without totally overwhelming the verbal images. None of this classic poetry is easy reading, and all three books will work best for reading aloud and group discussion. <i>Hazel Rochman</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

With its distinctive form of liberalism----resting on an idea of free public reason---- <i>Political Liberalism</i> yields new insights into the question of justice in our pluralistic society.</p></p><p>This book continues and revises the ideas of justice as fairness that John Rawls presented in <i>A Theory of Justice</i> but changes its philosophical interpretation in a fundamental way. That previous work assumed what Rawls calls a "well-ordered society," one that is stable and relatively homogenous in its basic moral beliefs and in which there is broad agreement about what constitutes the good life. This book goes deeper to ask how a stable and just society of free and equal citizens can live in concord when divided by reasonable but incompatible doctrines.<p>The late John Rawls was Emeritus Professor of Philosophy at Harvard University.</p></p><h2>Contempt (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><i>Contempt</i> is a brilliant and unsettling work by one of the revolutionary masters of modern European literature.

Created at the request of educators, therapists and parents to learn more about how to teach students with weak social cognition and related social skills (Asperger&#39;s Syndrome, PDD-NOS, High Functioning Autism, ADHD, NLD, Hyperlexia) and those with murky social abilities. Many of the lessons Michelle weaves into her workshops are written in detail in this book, and there are many more the audiences have never heard! This comprehensive curriculum, breaks detailed lessons into eight chapters demonstrating how lessons evolve from working as a member of a group and observing others, through behavioral self-monitoring, interpreting and producing non-verbal/verbal responses and cues, while also providing hands on strategies for learning about many other areas of social complexity. Each practical lesson builds on the next, across the months and years. IEP goals, tied to Educational Standards, follow each chapter to help parents and professionals connect social goals relate to core academic success. The Curriculum also encourages student self-monitoring with the use of video feedback. The focus of each chapter is to teach a set of &#34;social thinking vocabulary&#34; to be carried out of the therapy room and used across the student&#39;s entire day; both at the school and home. A handout defining these social thinking concepts is provided for parents and professionals working with these students to encourage the carry over of these key concepts. This curriculum is helpful to any parent or professional trying to understand the depth and complexity of teaching social thinking and related social skills to children who are weak in developing these areas. The publication certainly teaches all of us that we cannot take social development for granted.</p><p></p><h2>Our Mutual Friend (Modern Library Classics)</h2><p>A satiric masterpiece about the allure and peril of money, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> revolves around the inheritance of a dust-heap where the rich throw their trash. When the body of John Harmon, the dust-heap&#x2019;s expected heir, is found in the Thames, fortunes change hands surprisingly, raising to new heights &#x201c;Noddy&#x201d; Boffin, a low-born but kindly clerk who becomes &#x201c;the Golden Dustman.&#x201d; Charles Dickens&#x2019;s last complete novel, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> encompasses the great themes of his earlier works: the pretensions of the nouveaux riches, the ingenuousness of the aspiring poor, and the unfailing power of wealth to corrupt all who crave it. With its flavorful cast of characters and numerous subplots, <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens&#x2019;s most complex&#x2014;and satisfying&#x2014;novels.</p><p><i>Our Mutual Friend</i> was the last novel Charles Dickens completed and is, arguably, his darkest and most complex. The basic plot is vintage Dickens: an inheritance up for grabs, a murder, a rocky romance or two, plenty of skullduggery, and a host of unforgettable secondary characters. But in this final outing the author's heroes are more flawed, his villains more sympathetic, and the story as a whole more harrowing and less sentimental. The mood is set in the opening scene in which a riverman, Gaffer Hexam, and his daughter Lizzie troll the Thames searching for drowned men whose pockets Gaffer will rifle before turning the body over to the authorities. On this particular night Gaffer finds a corpse that is later identified as that of John Harmon, who was returning from abroad to claim a large fortune when he was apparently murdered and thrown into the river. <p> Harmon's death is the catalyst for everything else that happens in the novel. It seems the fortune was left to the young man on the condition that he marry a girl he'd never met, Bella Wilfer. His death, however, brings a new heir onto the scene, Nicodemus Boffin, the kind-hearted but low-born assistant to Harmon's father. Boffin and his wife adopt young Bella, who is determined to marry money, and also hire a mysterious young secretary, John Rokesmith, who takes an uncommon interest in their ward. Not content with just one plot, Dickens throws in a secondary love story featuring the riverman's daughter, Lizzie Hexam; a dissolute young upper-class lawyer, Eugene Wrayburn; and his rival, the headmaster Bradley Headstone. Dark as the novel is, Dickens is careful to leaven it with secondary characters who are as funny as they are menacing--blackmailing Silas Wegg and his accomplice Mr. Venus, the avaricious Lammles, and self-centered Charlie Hexam. <i>Our Mutual Friend</i> is one of Dickens's most satisfying novels, and a fitting denouement to his prolific career. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>&#x201c;The fact that Dickens is always thought of as a caricaturist, although he was constantly trying to be something else, is perhaps the surest mark of his genius.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b>George Orwell</b></p><h2>The Paleo Diet Cookbook: More Than 150 Recipes for Paleo Breakfasts, Lunches, Dinners, Snacks, and Beverages</h2><p>Dr. Loren Cordain's <em>The Paleo Diet</em> has helped thousands of people lose weight, keep it off, and learn how to eat for good health by following the diet of our Paleolithic ancestors and eating the foods we were genetically designed to eat.

The authors present their own unique integration of Ericksonian techniques, traditional models of hypnotherapy, and recent research in related areas. Numerous new patterns modeled from the work of Milton H. Erickson, M.D. are clearly explained and demonstrated. The use of trance in training design, to unconsciously install the skills being taught to the participants, is also covered.<p>The book developed from transcripts of a four day workshop, and the design of the book parallels the design chosen for the training itself. Individual exercises or those done in groups of two or three are offered so that the reader may practice the techniques and learn the skills.</p><p>There are numerous "live" demonstrations, inductions, and double inductions which create for the reader a real "feel" of how hypnosis is done and which are also a rich source for linguistic analysis for the advanced reader.</p><p>Written with insight and humor, this book's most unique twist is its use of multi-level communication and hypnotic language to create a "training trance" for the readers as they journey through the text. Some hypnotic references are obvious and explicit -- those which are not obvious will create enjoyable "ah-ha!" experiences for the reader as they are discovered.</p></p><p></p><h2>Harper&#39;s Bible Dictionary - 1st Edition/1st Printing</h2><p>More than 3,500 articles, written by members of the Society of Biblical Literature, present essential information on every aspect of the Old Testament, Apocrypha, and New Testament and are supplemented by photographs, maps, tables, and charts</p><p>General editor Achtemeier commissioned more than 3500 original articles from 179 Christian and Jewish scholars (all members of the Society of Biblical Literature, and hailing from seven countries) for this nonsectarian reference source which can be used with any Bible translation.

An allegorical story of World War I, set in the trenches in France and dealing ostensibly with a mutiny in a French regiment, it was originally considered a sharp departure for Faulkner. Recently it has come to be recognized as one of his major works and an essential part of the Faulkner <i>oeuvre</i>. Faulkner himself fought in the war, and his descriptions of it "rise to magnificence," according to <i>The New York Times</i>, and include, in Malcolm Cowley's words, "some of the most powerful scenes he ever conceived."</p><p>An allegorical story of World War I set in the trenches in France and dealing ostensibly with a mutiny in a French regiment.William Faulkner was born in New Albany, Mississippi, on September 25, 1897. His family was rooted in local history: his great-grandfather, a Confederate colonel and state politician, was assassinated by a former partner in 1889, and his grandfather was a wealth lawyer who owned a railroad. When Faulkner was five his parents moved to Oxford, Mississippi, where he received a desultory education in local schools, dropping out of high school in 1915. Rejected for pilot training in the U.S. Army, he passed himself off as British and joined the Canadian Royal Air Force in 1918, but the war ended before he saw any service. After the war, he took some classes at the University of Mississippi and worked for a time at the university post office. Mostly, however, he educated himself by reading promiscuously.<br><br>Faulkner had begun writing poems when he was a schoolboy, and in 1924 he published a poetry collection, <b>The Marble Faun</b>, at his own expense. His literary aspirations were fueled by his close friendship with Sherwood Anderson, whom he met during a stay in New Orleans. Faulkner's first novel, <b>Soldier&#x2019;s Pay</b>, was published in 1926, followed a year later by <b>Mosquitoes</b>, a literary satire. His next book, <b>Flags in the Dust</b>, was heavily cut and rearranged at the publisher&#x2019;s insistence and appeared finally as <b>Sartoris</b> in 1929. In the meantime he had completed <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>, and when it appeared at the end of 1929 he had finished <b>Sanctuary</b> and was ready to begin writing <b>As I Lay Dying</b>. That same year he married Estelle Oldham, whom he had courted a decade earlier.<br><br>Although Faulkner gained literary acclaim from these and subsequent novels&#x2014;<b>Light in August</b> (1932), <b>Pylon</b> (1935), <b>Absalom, Absalom!</b> (1936), <b>The Unvanquished</b> (1938), <b>The Wild Palms</b> (1939), <b>The Hamlet</b> (1940), and <b>Go Down, Moses</b> (1942)&#x2014;and continued to publish stories regularly in magazines, he was unable to support himself solely by writing fiction. he worked as a screenwriter for MGM, Twentieth Century-Fox, and Warner Brothers, forming a close relationship with director Howard Hawks, with whom he worked on <b>To Have and Have Not</b>, <b>The Big Sleep</b>, and <b>Land of the Pharaohs</b>, among other films. In 1944 all but one of Faulkner's novels were out of print, and his personal life was at low ebb due in part to his chronic heavy drinking. During the war he had been discovered by Sartre and Camus and others in the French literary world. In the postwar period his reputation rebounded, as Malcolm Cowley's anthology <b>The Portable Faulkner</b> brought him fresh attention in America, and the immense esteem in which he was held in Europe consolidated his worldwide stature.<br><br>Faulkner wrote seventeen books set in the mythical Yoknapatawpha County, home of the Compson family in <b>The Sound and the Fury</b>. &#x201c;No land in all fiction lives more vividly in its physical presence than this county of Faulkner&#x2019;s imagination,&#x201d; Robert Penn Warren wrote in an essay on Cowley&#x2019;s anthology. &#x201c;The descendants of the old families, the descendants of bushwhackers and carpetbaggers, the swamp rats, the Negro cooks and farm hands, the bootleggers and gangsters, tenant farmers, college boys, county-seat lawyers, country storekeepers, peddlers&#x2014;all are here in their fullness of life and their complicated interrelations.&#x201d; In 1950, Faulkner traveled to Sweden to accept the 1949 Nobel Prize for Literature. In later books&#x2014;<b>Intruder in the Dust</b> (1948), <b>Requiem for a Nun</b> (1951), <b>A Fable</b> (1954), <b>The Town</b> (1957), <b>The Mansion</b> (1959), and <b>The Reivers</b> (1962)&#x2014;he continued to explore what he had called &#x201c;the problems of the human heart in conflict with itself,&#x201d; but did so in the context of Yoknapatawpha&#x2019;s increasing connection with the modern world. He died of a heart attack on July 6, 1962.</p><h2>Designing Commercial Interiors</h2><p>The definitive reference on designing commercial interiors-expanded and updated for today's facilities<br> <br> Following the success of the ASID/Polsky Prize Honorable Mention in 1999, authors Christine Piotrowski and Elizabeth Rogers have extensively revised this guide to planning and designing commercial interiors to help professionals and design students successfully address today's trends and project requirements.

A guest instructor in all 50 states, juror, and lecturer, Webb has received over 110 major medals and awards from national competitions, including six from the American Watercolor Society. Collectors of Webb&#39;s paintings include National Taiwan Arts Education Center, Baylor University, Palmer Museum of Art at Penn State University, Portland Museum of Art, and South Arkansas Arts Center, to name a few. Webb is featured in Who&#39;s Who in American Art and Who&#39;s Who in the East, and he is also a member of the Allied Artists of America, Audubon Artists, the Rocky Mountain National Watermedia Association, and many other art associations.Going beyond the usual array of technical exercises and exploring the philosophy of art, Webb offers an unusually sophisticated and idiosyncratic approach to watercolor. The book wisely seeks to inspire artistic self-discovery rather than merely to teach Webb's particular style. Since, in his words, "painting is more caught than taught," he stresses the importance of how one sees before the painting process begins. Discussions of the synthesis of abstraction and realism are supported by clear and dramatic technical examples. Unlike many watercolor books, Webb's covers a broad spectrum of subjects beyond traditional landscapes. An unusually literate manual, this is recommended for most collections.<br><i>- Daniel J.

Jung)</h2><p><p>Alchemy is central to Jung's hypothesis of the collective unconscious. In this volume he begins with an outline of the process and aims of psychotherapy, and then moves on to work out the analogies between alchemy, Christian dogma and symbolism and his own understanding of the analytic process.</p> <p>Introducing the basic concepts of alchemy, Jung reminds us of the dual nature of alchemy, comprising both the chemical process and a parallel mystical component. He also discusses the seemingly deliberate mystification of the alchemists. Finally, in using the alchemical process as providing insights into individuation, Jung emphasises the importance of alchemy in relating to us the transcendent nature of the psyche.</p></p><p>Because of his consideration on many literary works, Classical, Oriental, and Western, Symbols of Transformation has a particular interest for students of literature."Readers . . . who believe that medieval and early modern alchemy was only a misguided effort to transform base metals into gold, or at best a crude preparation for scientific chemistry, will experience a great and probably bewildering surprise."<b>--<i>Thought</i></b></p><h2>U.S. Constitution For Dummies</h2><p><b>An in-depth look at the defining document of America</b> <p>Want to make sense of the U.S. Constitution?

Delivered by day into the searing inferno of the steel mills, by night they encounter a world of surreal devastation, crowded with dogfighters, whores, cripples, strikers, and scabs. Keenly sensitive to character, prophetic in its depiction of environmental degradation and globalized labor, Attaway's novel is an unprecedneted confrontation with the realities of American life, offering an apocalyptic vision of the melting pot not as an icon of hope but as an instrument of destruction.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><i>Blood on the Forge</i> was first published in 1941, when it attracted the admiring attention of Richard Wright and Ralph Ellison. It is an indispensable account of a major turning point in black history, as well as a triumph of individual style, charged with the concentrated power and poignance of the blues.</p></p><p>First published in 1941, this is a scalding, uncompromising novel of the Great Migration and its impact on the Southern black man. With a new introduction by Nicholas Lemann, author of the award-winning <i>The Promised Land: The Great Black Migration And How It Changed America</i>.<b>William Attaway</b> (1911&#x2013;1986) was born in Mississippi, the son of a physician who moved his family to Chicago to escape the segregated South. Attaway was an indifferent student in high school, but after hearing a Langston Hughes poem read in class and discovering that Hughes was black, he was inspired with an urgent ambition to write. Rebelling against his middle-class origins, Attaway dropped out of the University of Illinois and spent some time as a hobo before returning to complete his college degree in 1936. He then worked variously as a seaman, a salesman, a union organizer, and as part of the Federal Writers&#x2019; Project, where he made friends with Richard Wright. Attaway moved to New York, published his first novel,&nbsp;<i>Let Me Breathe Thunder</i>&nbsp;(1939), the story of two white vagrants traveling with a young Mexican boy, and quickly followed it with&nbsp;<i>Blood on the Forge</i>&nbsp;(1941), about the fate of three African-American brothers in the Great Migration to the North. Attaway never produced another novel, but went on to prosper as a writer of radio and television scripts, screenplays, and numerous songs, including the &#x201c;Banana Boat Song (Day-O),&#x201d; which was a hit for his friend Harry Belafonte. A resident for many years of Barbados, Attaway returned to the United States toward the end of his life.

But is he cunning enough to turn his dreams into reality&#x2015;and could he commit the most devious murder in pursuit of his goals?</p><p>This ingenious crime novel, with its unusual 'inverted' structure and sympathetic portrait of a man on the edge, is one of the greatest works by this highly respected author. The elaborate means of murder devised by Crofts's characters is perhaps unsurpassed in English crime fiction for its ostentatious intricacy.</p><p>This new edition is the first in several decades and includes an introduction by the award-winning novelist and crime fiction expert Martin Edwards.</p></p><p><p><strong>FREEMAN WILLS CROFTS</strong> (1879-1957) was one of the pre-eminent writers in the golden age of British crime fiction. He was the author of more than thirty detective novels, and was greatly acclaimed by peers such as Agatha Christie and Raymond Chandler.</p>"This wonderfully intricate puzzle by one of the foremost writers during the Golden Age of British crime fiction was first published in 1938 and has been re-issued as part of the British Library's Crime Classics series. Crofts introduced the "inverted mystery" structure here, in which the traditional whodunit is turned on its head, with the reader following the murderer through temptation and commission and then watching the detective (Crofts' continuing character, Inspector French) sort through the sparse clues. With Crofts at the helm, this makes for identification with the murderer and also excruciating suspense throughout. The action centers on George Surridge, a zoo director whose life is unraveling. Surridge has a miserable marriage, a gambling habit, and a new drain on his finances in the form of a woman he's fallen in love with. Crofts also presents us with a fascinating backdrop with the running of the zoo. The day-to-day operations (how many herrings are needed to feed a king penguin each day, for example) are given in precise detail, with a special emphasis on security arrangements for the reptile house, which figures prominently later on. While the murder plot and method are gasp-inducing, Crofts' depiction of a man sliding more and more into temptation is thrilling as well.

"Backgrounds and Sources" reprints generous excerpts from Dreiser&#x2019;s autobiographies and other writings that help establish his personal connection to the novel. Coverage of the supposed "suppression" of <em>Sister Carrie</em> by its first publisher is drawn from Dreiser&#x2019;s correspondence with Frank Norris, Arthur Henry, Walter H. Page, and F. N. Doubleday. "Criticism" collects thirteen essays, six of them new to the Third Edition, that discuss Dreiser&#x2019;s distinctive literary naturalism and narrative technique, the novel&#x2019;s relationship to American culture, and issues of gender and class in the novel, among other topics. Contributors include Ellen Moers, Robert Penn Warren, Amy Kaplan, Alan Trachtenberg, and Donald Pizer, among others. A Chronology of <em>Sister Carrie</em> and a Selected Bibliography are also included.</p><p><i>Sister Carrie</i>, Theodore Dreiser's revolutionary first novel, was published in 1900--sort of. The story of Carrie Meeber, an 18-year-old country girl who moves to Chicago and becomes a kept woman, was strong stuff at the turn of the century, and what Dreiser's wary publisher released was a highly expurgated version. Times change, and we now have a restored "author's cut" of <i>Sister Carrie</i> that shows how truly ahead of his time Dreiser was. First and foremost, he has written an astute, nonmoralizing account of a woman and her limited options in late-19th-century America. That's impressive in and of itself, but Dreiser doesn't stop there. Digging deeply into the psychological underpinnings of his characters, he gives us people who are often strangers to themselves, drifting numbly until fate pushes them on a path they can later neither defend nor even remember choosing.<p> Dreiser's story unfolds in the measured cadences of an earlier era. This sometimes works brilliantly as we follow the choices, small and large, that lead some characters to doom and others to glory. On the other hand, the middle chapters--of which there are many--do drag somewhat, even when one appreciates Dreiser's intentions. If you can make it through the sagging midsection, however, you'll be rewarded by <i>Sister Carrie</i>'s last 150 pages, which depict the harrowing downward spiral of one of the book's central characters. Here Dreiser portrays with brutal power how the wrong decision--or lack of decision--can lay waste to a life. <i>--Rebecca Gleason</i></p>Theodore Dreiser had a hardscrabble youth and the years of newspaper work behind him when he began his first novel, <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the story of a beautiful Midwestern girl who makes it big in New York City. Published by Doubleday in 1900, it gained a reputation as a shocker, for Dreiser had dared to give the public a heroine whose "cosmopolitan standard of virtue" brings her from Wisconsin, with four dollars in her purse, to a suite at the Waldorf and glittering fame as an actress. With <i>Sister Carrie</i>, the original manuscript of which is in the New York Public Library collections, Dreiser told a tale not "sufficiently delicate" for many of its first readers and critics, but which is now universally recognized as one of the greatest and most influential American novels.</p><h2>Alice&#39;s Adventures in Wonderland</h2><p><p>A New York Times Bestseller that Appeals to All Ages</p><p>A beloved favorite work of fiction for readers young and old, <em>Alice&#x2019;s Adventures in Wonderland</em> has inspired many artists to visually interpret the tale over the years, but none with distinct, edgy style of renowned artist Camille Rose Garcia. A novel, richly illustrated, and colorful interpretation of Carroll&#x2019;s story, this deluxe volume, printed on a beautiful, thick paper, captures the imagination with a wealth of stunning four-color art throughout, including full-page illustrations to open every chapter, numerous double-page images, and plenty of delightful whimsical art in between. The use of gold ornamentation and type throughout enhances this very special volume, which became an instant <em>New York Times</em> bestseller upon publication.</p></p><p>Source of legend and lyric, reference and conjecture, <i>Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</i> is for most children pure pleasure in prose. While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

If you are, your parents look like this, and they eat aphids.&#x201d; So begins a charming little book from the Backyard Books series (<i>Are You a Snail?</i>, not reviewed) that documents the amazing life cycle of the common ladybug. Throughout, Humphries engages the viewer's imagination with clear, close-up illustrations, done in soft watercolors, of beetles from egg to adult. The text invites the listener to be part of the story, growing inside an egg, hatching as a strange larva, resting in the hard, shell-like pupa, and finally emerging complete with wings, spots, and a bright red coat. &#x201c;Congratulations, you're a ladybug.&#x201d; With tongue in cheek, the author explains that if your parents look like humans, you are not a ladybug, &#x201c;You are a human child.&#x201d; And advises, &#x201c;Your skin will not split as you grow. You can't fly. It is very unlikely that you are red with black dots.&#x201d; The author concludes with facts about ladybugs; for example, &#x201c;a ladybug can eat about 70 aphids a day.&#x201d; The titles in this series have shiny board covers, glossy paper, a modest price, small size and a great deal of appeal. For reading aloud or reading alone, preschool and early childhood children will find these young information books delightful. (Nonfiction. 4-8) -- <i>Copyright � 2000 Kirkus Associates, LP.

This dandy, who remains forever unchanged petulant, hedonistic, vain, and amoral while a painting of him ages and grows increasingly hideous with the years, has been horrifying, enchanting, obsessing, even corrupting readers for more than a hundred years.<p>Taking the reader in and out of London drawing rooms, to the heights of aestheticism, and to the depths of decadence, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is not only a melodrama about moral corruption. Laced with bon mots and vivid depictions of upper-class refinement, it is also a fascinating look at the milieu of Wilde&#x2019;s fin-de-si�cle world and a manifesto of the creed Art for Art&#x2019;s Sake.&#x201d;</p><p>The ever-quotable Wilde, who once delighted London with his scintillating plays, scandalized readers with this, his only novel. Upon publication, Dorian was condemned as dangerous, poisonous, stupid, vulgar, and immoral, and Wilde as a driveling pedant.&#x201d; The novel, in fact, was used against Wilde at his much-publicized trials for gross indecency,&#x201d; which led to his imprisonment and exile on the European continent. Even so, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> firmly established Wilde as one of the great voices of the Aesthetic movement, and endures as a classic that is as timeless as its hero.</p><p><b>Camille Cauti, Ph.D.</b>, is an editor and literary critic who lives in New York City. She is a specialist in the Catholic conversion trend among members of the avant-garde in London in the 1890s.</p></p><p>A lush, cautionary tale of a life of vileness and deception or a loving portrait of the aesthetic impulse run rampant? Why not both? After Basil Hallward paints a beautiful, young man's portrait, his subject's frivolous wish that the picture change and he remain the same comes true. Dorian Gray's picture grows aged and corrupt while he continues to appear fresh and innocent. After he kills a young woman, "as surely as if I had cut her little throat with a knife," Dorian Gray is surprised to find no difference in his vision or surroundings. "The roses are not less lovely for all that. The birds sing just as happily in my garden." <p> As Hallward tries to make sense of his creation, his epigram-happy friend Lord Henry Wotton encourages Dorian in his sensual quest with any number of Wildean paradoxes, including the delightful "When we are happy we are always good, but when we are good we are not always happy." But despite its many languorous pleasures, <i>The Picture of Dorian Gray</i> is an imperfect work. Compared to the two (voyeuristic) older men, Dorian is a bore, and his search for ever new sensations far less fun than the novel's drawing-room discussions. Even more oddly, the moral message of the novel contradicts many of Wilde's supposed aims, not least "no artist has ethical sympathies. An ethical sympathy in an artist is an unpardonable mannerism of style." Nonetheless, the glamour boy gets his just deserts. And Wilde, defending Dorian Gray, had it both ways: "All excess, as well as all renunciation, brings its own punishment."</p>Oscar Wilde's only published full length novel, is the story of a man who sells his soul for eternal youth. In exchange, what does he give up and what does he gain? This novel, by Wilde is a wonderful soul-searching example of the cost of paradise, and the price of a wish. <p>Read by actor, comedian, novelist, journalist, screenwriter Stephen Fry, Dorian Gray's dilemma comes alive. He has also acted in a variety of films including A Fish Called Wanda, Peter's Friends, and The Wind in the Willows.</p></p><h2>Logic: A Complete Introduction (Complete Introductions)</h2><p>Understand Logic is a comprehensive introduction to this fascinating though sometimes challenging subject. <br><br>As well as looking at logic in theoretical terms the book considers its everyday uses and demonstrates how it has genuine practical applications. <br><br>It will take you step by step through the most difficult concepts and is packed with exercises to help you consolidate your learning at every stage. <br><br>Covering everything from syllogistic logic to logical paradoxes and even looking at logic in Alice in Wonderland, this is the only guide you will ever need.</p><p>Siu-Fan Lee is Assistant Professor at the Department of Religion and Philosophy, Hong Kong Baptist University.

She erupts into the lives of aging brother and sister Matthew and Marilla Cuthbert, a girl instead of the boy they had sent for. Thus begins a story of transformation for all three; indeed the whole rural community of Avonlea comes under Anne&#39;s influence in some way. We see her grow from a girl to a young woman of sixteen, making her mistakes, and not always learning from them. Intelligent, hot-headed as her own red hair, unwilling to take a moral truth as read until she works it out for herself, she must also face grief and loss and learn the true meaning of love. Part Tom Sawyer, part Jane Eyre, by the end of Anne of Green Gables, Anne has become the heroine of her own story.</p><p></p><h2>Introduction to Sport Law</h2><p><p>A comprehensive text on legal issues in sport, <i>Introduction to Sport Law</i> delivers the information students will need and sport management professionals require in order to navigate liability issues, protect the legal rights of their employees and athletes, and manage legal risk in their professions.

He has played a key role in unearthing confidential documentation of the atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge. His writings have transformed our understanding not only of twentieth-century Cambodia but also of the historical phenomenon of genocide. This new book&#x2014;the first global history of genocide and extermination from ancient times&#x2014;is among his most important achievements. Kiernan examines outbreaks of mass violence from the classical era to the present, focusing on worldwide colonial exterminations and twentieth-century case studies including the Armenian genocide, the Nazi Holocaust, Stalin&#x2019;s mass murders, and the Cambodian and Rwandan genocides. He identifies connections, patterns, and features that in nearly every case gave early warning of the catastrophe to come: racism or religious prejudice, territorial expansionism, and cults of antiquity and agrarianism. The ideologies that have motivated perpetrators of mass killings in the past persist in our new century, says Kiernan. He urges that we heed the rich historical evidence with its telltale signs for predicting and preventing future genocides.</p></p><p><p>Ben Kiernan is the A. Whitney Griswold Professor of History, professor of international and area studies, and the founding director of the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University (www.yale.edu/gsp). His previous books include <i>How Pol Pot Came to Power: Colonialism, Nationalism, and Communism in Cambodia, 1930&#x2013;1975 </i>and<i> The Pol Pot Regime: Race, Power, and Genocide in Cambodia under the Khmer Rouge, 1975-1979</i>, published by Yale University Press.</p>"Humans have been slaughtering each other for thousands of years, but only now is the field of genocide studies blooming. This grim account of history notes remarkable parallels in the patterns of mass slaughter, from Carthage to Darfur. With references to the genocides sanctioned by the Bible, it's ghastly reading. Yet you also can't help feeling a measure of progress over the centuries. Today, we're still far too passive about stopping genocide, but even those leaders who engage in it tend to be embarrassed, rather than boastful."&#x2015;Nicholas D. Kristof, New-York Historical Society series "Books That Matter," <i>New York Times Book Review</i> <br><br>"A great advancement has been made by Ben Kiernan's monumental new book, <i>Blood and Soil</i>. . . . The author's perspective is global and he is interested in genocide before the twentieth century. . . . This is a comparative and temporal vision that only the world history approach can provide."&#x2015;A. Dirk Moses, <i>The Online Encyclopedia of Mass Violence</i><br>"Illuminatingly put together, well-narrated and lucidly discussed. A comparison that comes to my mind is James Frazer's <i>The Golden Bough</i>. As was the case with that great classic, no scholar in the field has previously brought together such a wealth of diverse material and imposed consistent order upon it . . . Kiernan brings order&#x2015;region by region, era by era, reich by reich&#x2015;to the appalling catalogue of atrocity that he so impressively commands. Moreover, he does so in plain, straightforward, informative prose. . . . This is pioneering work. . . . He has signposted a way towards a global understanding of the curse of genocide. As such, this book could eventually contribute to the saving of lives&#x2015;possibly countless lives. No other work in the humanities can aspire to that. This is a major achievement."&#x2015;Patrick Wolfe, <i>Melbourne</i> <i>Age</i><br>"Remarkable but harrowing . . . the author is forever splicing unexpected and illuminating primary-source threads."&#x2015;Stephen Saunders, <i>Canberra Times</i> <br><br><p>"Kiernan has put a prodigious amount of research into this book, particularly on the colonial massacres, andhe has made a&nbsp;significant contribution to an increasingly important debate."&#x2015;Tim Johnson, <i>The Australian</i></p><br>"With this book, [Kiernan] examines genocide globally, venturing a framework by which genocide may be recognized and analyzed. . . . Covering instances of genocide on every continent . . . Kiernan notes haunting continuities across cultures and time periods. . . . A bold and substantial work of unprecedented scope, this book is international history at its best."&#x2015;<i>Booklist</i><br><p>"Ben Kiernan's <i>Blood and Soil</i>, a meticulous new study of this most slippery of criminal categories . . . highlights the contrast between our conventional and our legalistic definition of genocide by choosing case studies that, with few exceptions, attain the highest standard of vileness. . . . The chapters on the least known of the genocides offer particular value as introductions to overlooked regional histories, and the material on the Nazis and Ottoman Turks nicely situate both those groups within larger contexts of ethnic violence. Each case is written sharply enough to escape the aroma of potted history that sometimes afflicts comparative studies of this type."&#x2014;Graeme Wood, <i>New York Sun</i></p><br><p>"Ben Kiernan has provided the most extensive history of our genocidal propensities that I have ever read. He starts his history early, with Roman and Greek massacres of barbarians, and works through the Spanish conquest of the Americas, the exterminating vigor of American settlers toward Indians, the Turkish way with the Armenians, the German way with the Jews, Stalin's way with the Ukrainians, the Khmer Rouge's way with the Cambodians, the Serbs' way with the Muslims, the Hutus' way with the Tutsis, and the Sudanese way with the Darfurians. If you want to know how it was done, where and when it was done, and how many victims there were, Kiernan has the answers. This is a formidable and important book."&#x2015;Michael Ignatieff, <i>New Republic</i></p><br>"A major research work and reference. . . . An important resource for those interested in studying genocide and in helping to prevent genocide."&#x2015;George W. Doherty, <i>PsycCRITIQUES</i><br>"The dismal record of lethal violence that <i><i>Blood and Soil</i></i> presents to its readers is therefore a corrective to my own long-standing preference for emphasizing cooperation . . . Surely a well-balanced history of the subtle connections of human cooperation and violence is what we should aim for; and I fear that my books fall short of that ideal. So, despite all my reservations about <i><i>Blood and Soil</i></i>, I owe Ben Kiernan a considerable debt."&#x2014;William H. McNeill, <i><i>New York</i></i><i><i> Review of Books</i></i><br>"Astonishingly broad, well-documented. . . . A landmark in the study of genocide."&#x2015;Daniel Chirot, <i>Comparative Political Studies</i><br>"Kiernan is especially qualified to have undertaken such a pioneering work. He is founding director of the Genocide Studies Program at Yale University and has written or edited more than a half-dozen previous books on the Cambodian genocide of the 1970s. That period is discussed in this book along with many other efforts to eliminate racial, ethnic or religious groups, but the most extensive chapters are the ones dealing with settlers campaigns of genocide against native peoples in the Americas and Australia . . . it would be a positive step for standard high school textbooks to acknowledge the genocidal campaigns against Native Americans just as they have done regarding slavery."&#x2014;Darrell Turner, <i>National Catholic Reporter</i><br>"Kiernan is one of the leading scholars on Cambodian history, particularly the regime of Pol Pot and the genocide committed by the Khmer Rouge. . . . Both because of his academic credentials and the scope of the work <i>Blood and Soil </i>is a must-read book. While it is not without its flaws or unchallengeable in some of its arguments, it is a book that will become the center of much discussion in the coming months and years. Kiernan's book should be read by anyone who wants to get a better handle to the historical scope of genocide. The chapter on the genocidal actions taken against Native Americans is a phenomenal chapter."&#x2014;J.D. Bowers, <i>E-Wareness!</i>, Genocide and Human Rights Institute<br><p>"To learn from the tragedies and mistakes of the past . . . &nbsp;[is] an idea central to Ben Kiernan's massive <i>Blood and Soil</i>. . . . Kiernan details not only the Armenian genocide but also the numerous mass murders that took place before and since in eras and regions synonymous with the terrible events that line our history books. . . . Kiernan's explorations of genocide in the 19th-century Australian Outback and the formative years of East and Southeast Asia illuminate periods of genocidal history often overshadowed by the more mechanized and publicized mass killings of the 20th century. . . . The personalized accounts of witnesses remind us&#x2014;as all worthwhile studies of human disaster should&#x2014;of the individual human lives underneath all these millennia of collective death and destruction."&#x2014;Zak M. Salih, <i>Baltimore City Paper</i></p><br><p>"Lucidly unsettling. . . .

His book makes an original contribution to our understanding of the phenomenon."&#x2015;Michael Adas, Rutgers University</p><br><p>"Ben Kiernan&#x2019;s <i>Blood and Soil</i> is a major work explaining myths and metaphors that have underwritten genocide for six hundred years&#x2014;earlier within the bowels of the western tradition; now commonplace practice far beyond that tradition.&nbsp;In seeing genocide as linked to issues of land as well as race, nation, and expansion, Kiernan has opened up social, political, and economic analysis to the struggle for land and the control of property.&nbsp;Such an approach is unique as it is provocative.&nbsp;It is inspired by the author&#x2019;s profound reading of Cambodia and Southeast Asia.&nbsp;<i>Blood and Soil</i> provides an angle of vision rarely found in those who start (and stop) with a European base of scholarship.&nbsp;The book opens up new questions and formulations on the nature of state inspired murder. It merits a close reading of the dark side of terror, often commented upon, but rarely probed."&#x2014;Irving Louis Horowitz, Rutgers University&nbsp;</p><br><p>"<i>Blood and Soil</i> is a stunning achievement. The idea for the project was clearly a prompting of the heart, but the argument itself is a thing of pure intellect. It surveys thousands of years, visits every corner of the world, and stares with scarcely a blink at the worst horrors the world has ever known. As an act of scholarship, it simply stands alone."&#x2014;Kai Erikson, Yale University</p><br>"Ben Kiernan&#x2019;s book is a major contribution to genocide studies&#x2014;a first attempt to tell the history of genocidal events, from Sparta to Darfur,&nbsp;<i>Blood and Soil</i> is a well-researched, detailed account of many instances of mass killings and the reasons for their occurrence.

The authors, the world s leading voices in the treatment of young traumatized children, richly incorporate a wealth of experience gleaned from a decade of delivering this state-of-the-art intervention. One can hear their unmistakable voice of compassion, sensitivity, and admiration for the courage of these vulnerable children. --Robert S. Pynoos, MD, MPH Co-Director UCLA/Duke University National Center for Child Traumatic Stress Professor of Psychiatry, UCLA David Geffen School of Medicine<br><br>The long-awaited second edition of Don t Hit My Mommy! is a thorough updating of the basic premises and core principles of Child-Parent Psychotherapy (CPP), an exemplary evidence-based, relational treatment for high-risk children and families. Although CPP was originally based on psychoanalysis and attachment theory, its contemporary form has been influenced by cognitive behavioral therapy, stress and trauma work, social learning theory, and developmental psychopathology. Multiple randomized control trials (RCTs) support CPP efficacy in promoting attachment security and decreasing trauma symptoms in young children and their families. Lieberman and her co-authors ability to translate the work of CPP into a deep understanding of the trauma experience in families with domestic violence and child maltreatment holds great promise for improving the lives of children and families. This new edition of Don t Hit My Mommy! will be a seminal contribution. It is an invaluable resource to therapists who work with young children and to professionals working in child and family psychology, psychiatry, social work, counseling, and education. --Dante Cicchetti, PhD Institute of Child Development, University of Minnesota Professional Development</p><h2>Problem Solving with C++ (9th Edition)</h2><p><p> <br> </p> <p> <b>Note: </b>You are purchasing a standalone product; MyProgrammingLab does not come packaged with this content.

A practical application of devices or circuits covered in the chapter is presented. The student learns how the specific device or circuit is used and is asked to compare a schematic to a printed circuit board, develop a test procedure, and troubleshoot specific faults. A typical System Application is shown in Figure P-1. The System Applications are optional and skipping any of them does not affect any other coverage. </p> <p> Although they are not intended or designed for use as a laboratory project, most System Applications use realistic graphics for printed circuit boards and instruments.

Depending on individual preferences and program emphasis, selective coverage may be necessary. For example, you may choose to omit Chapter 11 if the topic of thyristors is covered in a later industrial electronics course. Chapters 12 through 18 can be covered in the second term. Again, selective coverage may be necessary. </p> <p> <b><i>Option 2 (one term).</i></b> By omitting certain topics and by maintaining a rigorous schedule, this book can be used in one-term courses. For example, a course covering only discrete devices and circuits would cover Chapters 1 through 11 with, perhaps, some selectivity. </p> <p> Similarly, a course requiring only linear integrated circuit coverage would cover Chapters 12 through 18. Another approach is a very selective coverage of discrete devices and circuits topics followed by a limited coverage of integrated circuits (only op-amps for example). </p> To the Student <p> There is an old saying that is very applicable to the study of this textbook as well as many other endeavors in life. It goes like this�<i>Do one thing at a time, do it very well, and then move on.</i> </p> <p> When studying a particular chapter, study one section until you understand it and only then move on to the next one. Read each section and study the related illustrations carefully, think about the material, work through each example step-by-step, work its Related Problem and check the answer, and then answer each question in the section review, checking your answers at the end of the chapter. Don't expect each concept to be crystal clear after a single reading; you may have to read the material two or even three times. Once you believe that you understand the material, review the chapter summary, key formula list, and key term definitions at the end of the chapter. Take the multiple-choice self-test. Finally, work the assigned problems at the end of the chapter. Working through these problems is perhaps the most important way to check and reinforce your comprehension of the chapter. By working problems, you acquire an additional level of insight and understanding that reading or classroom lectures alone do not provide. </p> <p> Generally, you cannot fully understand a concept or procedure by simply watching or listening to someone else. Only hard work and critical thinking will produce the results you expect and deserve. </p> Milestones in Electronics <p> Before you begin your study of electronic devices, let's briefly look at some of the important developments that led to the electronics technology we have today. The names of many of the early pioneers in electricity and electromagnetic s still live on in terms of familiar units and quantities. Names such as Ohm, Ampere, Volta, Farad, Henry, Coulomb, Oersted, and Hertz are some of the better known examples with which you are already familiar. More widely known names such as Franklin and Edison are also significant in the history of electricity and electronics because of their tremendous contributions. Biographies of a few important figures in the history of electronics are shown. </p> <p> <b>The Beginning of Electronics.</b> Early experiments with electronics involved electric currents in vacuum tubes. Heinrich Geissler (1814-1879) removed most of the air from a glass tube and found that the tube glowed when there was current through it. Later, Sir William Crookes (1832-1919) found the current in vacuum tubes seemed to consist of particles. Thomas Edison (1847-1931) experimented with carbon filament bulbs with plates and discovered that there was a current from the hot filament to a positively charged plate. He patented the idea but never used it. </p> <p> Other early experimenters measured the properties of the particles that flowed in vacuum tubes. Sir Joseph Thompson (1856-1940) measured properties of these particles, later called <i>electrons.</i> </p> <p> Although wireless telegraphic communication dates back to 1844, electronics is basically a 20th century concept that began with the invention of the vacuum tube amplifier. An early vacuum tube that allowed current in only one direction was constructed by John A. Fleming in 1904. Called the Fleming valve, it was the forerunner of vacuum tube diodes. In 1907, Lee DeForest added a grid to the vacuum tube. The new device, called the audiotron, could amplify a weak signal. By adding the control element, DeForest ushered in the electronics revolution. It was with an improved version of his device that made transcontinental telephone service and radios possible. In 1912, a radio amateur in San Jose, California, was regularly broadcasting music! </p> <p> In 1921, the secretary of commerce, Herbert Hoover, issued the first license to a broadcast radio station; within two years over 600 licenses were issued. By the end of the 1920s radios were in many homes.

Her 'Reading (and writing) Recovery' is an early literacy intervention, which is now implemented in five countries, and three languages. Literacy Lessons Designed For Individuals integrates what has been learned from that innovation with new research and theoretical advocacies. Shifts in early literacy learning can be monitored by teachers using her Observation Survey of Early Literacy Achievement in English, Spanish and French. A series of individual lessons can be delivered in those languages to about 150,000 children worldwide annually using a guidebook called Reading Recovery: Guidelines for Teachers in Training. Literacy Lessons Designed for Individuals is a similar guidebook which aims to make accelerated progress possible for a wider range of problems. Marie Clay was past-President of the International Reading Association, served on the editorial committees of professional journals, was a research consultant at home and abroad including UNESCO, chaired a Social Science Research Committee advising government on policies and research allocations, and worked internationally with problem-solving related to early intervention research and practice.</p></p><h2>all quiet on the western front</h2><p>Shows some signs of wear, and may have some markings on the inside. 100% Money Back Guarantee.</p><p>Paul Baumer enlisted with his classmates in the German army of World War I. Youthful, enthusiastic, they become soldiers. But despite what they have learned, they break into pieces under the first bombardment in the trenches. And as horrible war plods on year after year, Paul holds fast to a single vow: to fight against the principles of hate that meaninglessly pits young men of the same generation but different uniforms against each other--if only he can come out of the war alive.<br>"The world has a great writer in Erich Maria Remarque. He is a craftsman of unquestionably first trank, a man who can bend language to his will. Whether he writes of men or of inanimate nature, his touch is sensitive, firm, and sure."<br>THE NEW YORK TIMES BOOK REVIEW <p>"From the Paperback edition.</p>Erich Maria Remarque, who was born in Germany, was drafted into the German army during World War I. Through the hazardous years following the war he worked at many occupations: schoolteacher, small-town drama critic, race-car driver, editor of a sports magazine. His first novel, &#34;All Quiet on the Western Front, &#34; was published in Germany in 1928. A brilliant success, selling more than a million copies, it was the first of many literary triumphs. When the Nazis came to power, Remarque left Germany for Switzerland. He rejected all attempts to persuade him to return, and as a result he lost his German citizenship, his books were burned, and his films banned. He went to the United States in 1938 and became a citizen in 1947. He later lived in Switzerland with his second wife, the actress Paulette Goddard. He died in September 1970.</p><h2>Python Programming: An Introduction to Computer Science</h2><p>This book is designed to be used as the primary textbook in a college-level first course in computing. It takes a fairly traditional approach, emphasizing problem solving, design, and programming as the core skills of computer science. However, these ideas are illustrated using a non-traditional language, namely Python. Although Python is the language, teaching Python is not the main point of this book. Rather, Python is used to illustrate fundamental principles of design and programming that apply in any language or computing environment. In some places, certain Python features and idioms that are not generally found in other languages are avoided. There are already many good books about Python on the market; this book is intended as an introduction to computing.</p><p>"Disguised as a Python textbook, it's really an introduction to programming, using Python as the preffered medium for beginners." -- <i>Guido van Rossum, Creator of Python</i><br><br>"Introduces Python and computer science concepts in a style that beginning students find appealing and easy to understand." -- <i>Dave Reed, Capital University</i><br><br>"Provides clear explanation of introductory programming concepts, and shows why Python is an excellent choice for a first language." -- <i>Russell May, Morehead State University</i></p><h2>Magic, Witchcraft, and Religion: A Reader in the Anthropology of Religion</h2><p>This comparative reader takes an anthropological approach to the study of religious beliefs and practices, both strange and familiar. The engaging articles on all key issues related to the anthropology of religion grab the attention of students, while giving them an excellent foundation in contemporary ideas and approaches in the field. The multiple authors included in each chapter represent a range of interests, geographic foci, and ways of looking at each subject. Divided into 10 chapters, this book begins with a broad view of anthropological ways of looking at religion and moves on to some of the core topics within the subject, such as myth, ritual, and the various types of religious specialties.</p><p></p><h2>Interactions: Collaboration Skills for School Professionals, Loose-Leaf Version (8th Edition)</h2><p><p> </p><p> </p> <p> <b>Note: This is the loose-leaf version of</b>&nbsp;<b> <i>Interactions</i> and does not include access to the Enhanced Pearson eText.

For centuries, drawing the human figure has given artists the tools and vocabulary for creating paintings, sculpture, drawings, or prints-from Renaissance classical to contemporary expression. In addition to working from the model, the figure-drawing student needs instruction in anatomy, history, and conceptual approaches to drawing the human form; such instruction is often missing from life drawing classes due to time constraints. DRAWING FROM LIFE offers these elements, along with a tremendous selection of drawings that represent the broad range of approaches, techniques, and media for drawing from life. The chapters follow the natural development of a student&#39;s growth, from fundamental sketching and gesture drawing to creative expression and exploration. An entire chapter on drawing the figure in perspective offers information that is not available in comparable textbooks. Students begin with quick sketches and gesture drawings, giving them a non-threatening introduction on a level they can readily understand and master. The cohesive presentation of anatomy, including a chapter on the human head, helps students understand the human structure and its impact on visible form. The final section brings the concepts, vocabulary, and history presented in the earlier chapters to bear on contemporary use of the figure in art.</p><p>Clint Brown is Professor of Art at Oregon State University. He has taught life drawing classes to college students at several institutions for more than thirty years. He also spent a year teaching at Nottingham Trent University in England on a Fulbright exchange.

Dickens&#39; childhood experiences inform the vivid scenes in Marshalsea debtor s prison, while his adult perceptions of governmental failures shape his satirical picture of the Circumlocution Office. The novel s range of characters - the honest, the crooked, the selfish and the self-denying - offers a portrait of society about whose values Dickens had profound doubts.</p><p>The classic, definitive, world-famous Nonesuch Press edition of 1937, finally available again and bound in leather and linen. The text in these stunning volumes is taken from the 1867 Chapman and Hall edition, which became known as the Charles Dickens edition and was the last edition to be corrected by the author himself.

The three-volume set contains <i>A Tale of Two Cities, Little Dorrit,</i> and <i>The Life and Adventures of Martin Chuzzlewit</i>.Of the complex, richly rewarding masterworks he wrote in the last decade of his life, Little Dorrit is the book in which Charles Dickens most fully unleashed his indignation at the fallen state of mid-Victorian society. Crammed with persons and incidents in whose recreation nothing is accidental or spurious, containing, in its picture of the Circumlocution Office, the most witheringly exact satire of a bureaucracy we possess, Little Dorrit is a stunning example of how thoroughly Dickens could put his flair for the theatrical and his comic genius the service of his passion for justice.</p><h2>Ford LTD &amp; Mercury Marquis (75-82), Ford Custom 500, Country Squire, Crown Victoria &amp; Mercury Colony Park (75-87), Ford LTD Crown Victoria &amp; Mercury ...

This book is aimed at the latter, obviously limiting the scope of its applicability. Noted investment manager Sperandeo explains how he traces stocks and commodities using trends, Dow Theory, Fed-watching, stop-losses, charts, and the panoply of technical analysis combined with his own wrinkles. His chief antagonists are program traders (who move billions likewise in the short-term) and the whims of the market. In the second half, Sperandeo explores the psychology of trading and the use and importance of emotional discipline. He also stresses personal success, not just financial, and presents a solid condensed explanation of real economics, scathingly destroying the wishful-thinking economics of academics and politicians.

Are these words you wouldn't exactly use to describe yourself? Do you consider yourself too old or too out of shape to run a marathon? But somewhere deep inside have you always admired the people who could reach down and come up with the mental and physical strength to complete such a daunting and rewarding accomplishment? It doesn't have to be somebody else crossing the finish line. You can be a marathoner. <i>The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer</i> is based on the highly successful marathon class offered by the University of Northern Iowa, which was featured in a <i>Runner's World</i> article titled "Marathoning 101." The class has been offered five times over 10 years, and all but one student finished the marathon. That is approximately 200 students -- all first time marathoners and many with absolutely no running background. This book follows the same 16-week, four-day-a-week workout plan. What makes the success rate of this program so much higher than any other? The special emphasis on the psychological aspects of endurance activities. You don't have to love to run -- you don't even have to like it -- but you have to realize that you are capable of more than you have ever thought possible. One participant in the program explained it like this: "I'm doing this for me -- not for others or the time clock. I just feel better when I run, plus it helps me to cope with things in general. The skills we've learned in this class don't apply just to marathoning -- they apply to life! Just like you never know what the next step in a marathon will bring, so too, you never know what will happen next in life. But if you don't keep going, you're never going to find out. By staying relaxed, centered, and positive you handle just about anything that comes your way." This is marathon running for real people, people with jobs and families and obligations outside of running. <i>The Non-Runner's Marathon Trainer</i> has proven successful for men and women of all ages.

Reaching back into history as early as the 16th Century, Jay introduces readers to daredevils, mind readers, talented animals and their trainers, sword swallowers, and other wonders of the past. Some have been geniuses, others charlatans, but all have captured the imagination of their public. Although Jay handles the material unevenly, readers should leave the book with awe of the inventive genius of man, and of the incredible stamina of the human body. This is a delightful book for YAs who have a penchant for the extraordinary. It is full of colorful illustrations, posters, and billboards of yesteryear.

For the center of his cutting satire of American business he created the bustling, shallow, and myopic George F. Babbitt, the epitome of middle-class mediocrity. The novel cemented Lewis's prominence as a social commentator. <br>Babbitt basks in his pedestrian success and the popularity it has brought him. He demands high moral standards from those around him while flirting with women, and he yearns to have rich friends while shunning those less fortunate than he. But Babbitt's secure complacency is shattered when his best friend is sent to prison, and he struggles to find meaning in his hollow life. He revolts, but finds that his former routine is not so easily thrown over.&#x201c;[It is] by its hardness, its efficiency, its compactness that Mr. Lewis&#x2019;s work excels.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Virginia Woolf</b></p><h2>The Misinformation Age: How False Beliefs Spread</h2><p><b>The social dynamics of &#x201c;alternative facts&#x201d;: why what you believe depends on who you know</b><br><br> Why should we care about having true beliefs? And why do demonstrably false beliefs persist and spread despite bad, even fatal, consequences for the people who hold them?<br> &nbsp;<br> Philosophers of science Cailin O&#x2019;Connor and James Weatherall argue that social factors, rather than individual psychology, are what&#x2019;s essential to understanding the spread and persistence of false beliefs. It might seem that there&#x2019;s an obvious reason that true beliefs matter: false beliefs will hurt you. But if that&#x2019;s right, then why is it (apparently) irrelevant to many people whether they believe true things or not?<br> &nbsp;<br><i>The Misinformation Age</i>, written for a political era riven by &#x201c;fake news,&#x201d; &#x201c;alternative facts,&#x201d; and disputes over the validity of everything from climate change to the size of inauguration crowds, shows convincingly that what you believe depends on who you know.

With vital information on how to help people escape cult entrapments and recover from the experience, this book will be an invaluable resource to former cult members.</p><p>Most people believe that cult members are mentally unbalanced or are misfits who live in remote places, like the doomed devotees of Jim Jones and David Koresh. We take comfort in the fact that the influences of cults are far removed from our everyday lives.<br> Nothing could be further from the truth.<br> Over the past two decades, in the United States alone, an estimated twenty million people have joined cults. Today, three to five thousand cults are working to recruit new members. At any point in time, two-and-a-half to three million Americans are active cult members. Often a cult is disguised as a legitimate business or organization: a restaurant, self-help group, psychotherapy clinic, or leadership training program could be a front for a cult. Anyone&#x2014;no matter what age or income level&#x2014;could be susceptible to the covert and seductive nature of a cult. People are especially vulnerable to these masterful manipulators during periods of traumatic life changes: a college student away from home for the first time, a grief-stricken widow in need of understanding and support, or a businessperson transferred by his or her employer to a new and unfamiliar community.<br> The country's leading authority on cults, Margaret Thaler Singer, calls on her nearly fifty years of expertise to write the definitive book on cults. Written with author and former cult member Janja Lalich, Singer's first book is a shocking exposea that reveals what cults are and how they work. Cults in Our Midst offers vital information on how to help people escape cult entrapments and recover from the experience. This compelling book debunks commonly held myths and answers perplexing questions about cults such as:<br> <ul> <li>Why don't people just leave cults?<br> (li&gt; What characteristics do cults have in common?<br> </li> <li>Why isn't the U.S. Marines or Alcoholics Anonymous considered a cult?<br> </li> <li>Who are the people most likely to join cults?<br> </li> <li>Where can I go for help if someone I love is living in a cult?<br> </li> <li>What actions can we take to prevent the spread of cults' influence?</li> </ul> <br> Cults in Our Midst is filled with practical strategies and suggestions for understanding the cult phenomenon and helping cult members break free. The authors outline the methods of exit counseling that have been used successfully with thousands of cult members and address major areas of post-cult adjustment. Former cult members will find this book to be an invaluable resource to help them comprehend their cult experience and reclaim their lives.MARGARET THALER SINGER, Ph.D., is a clinical psychologist and adjunct professor emeritus at the University of California, Berkeley.

Yet Levi&#x2019;s body of work extends considerably beyond his experience as a survivor. Now, the transformation of Levi from Holocaust memoirist to one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s greatest writers culminates in this publication of <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em>. This magisterial collection finally gathers all of Levi&#x2019;s fourteen books&#x2015;memoirs, essays, poetry, and fiction&#x2015;into three slip-cased volumes. Thirteen of the books feature new translations, and the other is newly revised by the original translator. Nobel laureate Toni Morrison introduces Levi&#x2019;s writing as a &#x201c;triumph of human identity and worth over the pathology of human destruction.&#x201d; The appearance of this historic publication will occasion a major reappraisal of &#x201c;one of the most valuable writers of our time&#x201d; (Alfred Kazin).</p><p><em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em> features all new translations of: <em>The Periodic Table, The Drowned and the Saved, The Truce, Natural Histories, Flaw of Form, The Wrench, Lilith, Other People&#x2019;s Trades</em>, and <em>If Not Now, When?</em>&#x2015;as well as all of Levi&#x2019;s poems, essays, and other nonfiction work, some of which have never appeared before in English.</p></p><p><p><strong>Primo Levi</strong> (1919&#x2013;1987) was an Italian chemist and writer, best known for his memoirs <em>If This Is a Man</em> and <em>The Periodic Table</em>.</p><p><strong>Ann Goldstein</strong>, the editor of <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em> and the award-winning translator of Elena Ferrante&#x2019;s novels, is a former editor at <em>The New Yorker</em>.</p><p><strong>Toni Morrison</strong> is a winner of the Nobel Prize in Literature.</p>&#x201c;Levi&#x2019;s best writing was about his life, about questions of freedom and survival.... [A] remarkable achievement.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Tim Parks, <em>New York Review of Books</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Expertly edited by Ann Goldstein.... These three handsome volumes bring into focus the breadth and coherence of his genius, and make unexpectedly clear how deeply his work as a chemist shaped his unsettling work as a moralist and his unique vision of psychology and history.... The 3,000 pages of his <em>Complete Works</em> seem tragically few.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Edward Mendelson, <em>New York Times Book Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Represents a monumental and noble endeavor on the part of its publisher, its general editor, Ann Goldstein, and the many translators who have produced new versions of Levi&#x2019;s work. Although his best-known work has already benefited from fine English translation, it&#x2019;s a gift to have nearly all his writing gathered together, along with work that has not before been published in English.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Woods, <em>The New Yorker</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Old school publishing on a grand scale. Once more, Robert Weil of W.W. Norton, now director of its Liveright imprint, has produced a magnificent edition of an important, if slightly neglected, author.... For such a gift as <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em>, one should probably do little more than express thanks.... Whether as witness or imaginative artist, Levi stands high among the truly essential European writers of the past century.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Michael Dirda, <em>Washington Post</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Levi, a scientist and deep humanist, vividly comes alive in this boxed set. A laudable, monumental effort to gather the work of a crucial writer of the 20th century in one voluminous package.&#x201d;<br> - <strong><em>Kirkus Reviews, Starred Review</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;It is, by any measure, a monumental effort.... [Ann Goldstein] has succeeded. What he hear throughout is Primo Levi&#x2019;s voice: wry, honest, exact, compassionate in its recognition of human frailty, and imbued with (as he once wrote of Charles Darwin) &#x2018;the sober joy of a man who extracts order from chaos&#x2019;.... Goldstein and her collaborators have performed an amazing service by allowing us to see him, as it were, complete.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>James Marcus, <em>Harper's Magazine</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Wonderful.... You cannot forget [Levi]. He writes clearly, cogently, concretely, compactly. His is a scientist's eye, and he often said (with his trademark dry humor) that the main model for his writing was the lab report. Yet in the best contemporary sense, he's also stylish, laboratory-scrupulous in sentence, description, and word choice, always with a sense of the lively mind behind the words.... Levi is among the prime writers to emerge after World War II. This treasure trove will cement his reputation.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>John Timpane, <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A major and most welcome cultural event. It will astonish most of Levi&#x2019;s English-speaking readers by revealing the richness and extent of his oeuvre.... Levi discharged this duty triumphantly in works of unequaled intellectual rigor, compassion, and modesty.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Louis Begley, <em>American Scholar</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A binge reader of <em>The Complete Works of Primo Levi</em> will encounter science fiction, natural histories, and accounts of young love. Levi not only plunders chemical terminology for metaphors describing human affairs (his memoir The Periodic Table is a brilliant example) but also holds up precise, restrained scientific analysis as a model for prose.... As heir to the Italian Renaissance [Levi asks]: What is it to be human? ...Amid the bluster and bilge of the violent moment, we need that kind of voice more than ever.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven G. Kellman, <em>Chronicle of Higher Education</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;A remarkable three-volume set of memoirs, novels, short stories, essays, commentary, book reviews, and poetry, the <em>Complete Works</em> now enables us to appreciate the tangle of forms and identities that defined Levi as a writer: memorialist and fantasist, scientist and sensationalist, puritan and jester, poet and political commentator...It gives us a far more eclectic and interesting writer, one who ranged across a vast intellectual terrain that included astronomy, history, linguistics, classical literature, art, current affairs, memory, and religion.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Gavin Jacobson, <em>The New Republic</em></strong></p><h2>MasterLife 4: The Disciple&#39;s Mission - Member Book</h2><p><p><b>MasterLife 4: Disciple's Mission</b> by <b>Avery T.

But for all his obvious riches and his elegant appearance, Eliseo was also the possessor of a devastating secret: he was not, in fact, from Mexico at all. Rather, he had begun life as a slave named William Ellis, born on a cotton plantation in southern Texas during the waning years of King Cotton.</p><p>After emancipation, Ellis, capitalizing on the Spanish he learned during his childhood along the Mexican border and his ambivalent appearance, engaged in a virtuoso act of reinvention. He crafted an alter ego, the Mexican Guillermo Eliseo, who was able to access many of the privileges denied to African Americans at the time: traveling in first-class train berths, staying in upscale hotels, and eating in the finest restaurants.</p><p>Eliseo&#x2019;s success in crossing the color line, however, brought heightened scrutiny in its wake as he became the intimate of political and business leaders on both sides of the US-Mexico border. Ellis, unlike many passers, maintained a connection to his family and to black politics that also raised awkward questions about his racial status. Yet such was Ellis&#x2019;s skill in manipulating his era&#x2019;s racial codes, most of the whites he encountered continued to insist that he must be Hispanic even as Ellis became embroiled in scandals that hinted the man known as Guillermo Eliseo was not quite who he claimed to be.</p><p><em>The Strange Career of William Ellis</em> reads like a novel but offers fresh insights on the history of the Reconstruction era, the US-Mexico border, and the abiding riddle of race. At a moment when the United States is deepening its connections with Latin America and recognizing that race is more than simply black or white, Ellis&#x2019;s story could not be more timely or important.</p><em>&nbsp; Winner of the 2017&nbsp;Phillis Wheatley Award for nonfiction from the Harlem Book Fair &nbsp;</em> 1 map; 8 pages of illustrations</p><p>Karl Jacoby is a professor of history at Columbia University. The author of two previous books, he has won the Albert J. Beveridge Award and a Guggenheim Fellowship, among many other honors. He lives in New York.&#x201c;How is it that a black man named William Ellis, living in Reconstruction-era Texas, could transform himself into a Mexican magnate and conquer Wall Street, then disappear into history without a trace? Fortunately, Karl Jacoby has done the detective work to bring this intriguing larger-than-life figure back to life, challenging America&#x2019;s fixed concepts of race, ethnicity and national identity. This fascinating history book reads like a novel.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Margot Lee Shetterly, author of Hidden Figures</strong><br><br>&#x201c;A masterpiece of border history. Jacoby has a biographer&#x2019;s eye for detail and a detective&#x2019;s talent for discovery, which he deftly uses to construct both the inner emotional life and larger social world of his subject. At once a history of the United States and of Mexico, <em>Strange Career</em> offers a truly transnational history of late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century North America. Today, as borders are simultaneously being dissolved and hardened, Jacoby&#x2019;s study of Ellis&#x2019;s exceptional career is as timely as it is compelling.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Greg Grandin, author of <em>Empire of Necessity</em> and <em>Fordlandia</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;William Ellis was a chameleon, a trickster, and a man determined to shape his own identity. With enormous skill, Karl Jacoby uncovers this tremendous subject, revealing Ellis&#x2019;s lies, and crafting a powerful new narrative about the porous borders of class, race, and national identity in late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century American life. Deftly moving between the improbable details of Ellis&#x2019;s biography and the larger political and cultural stories of the day, Jacoby demonstrates how one man&#x2019;s life can help us understand the past in an entirely new way.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Martha A. Sandweiss, professor of history, Princeton University, and author of <em>Passing Strange: A Gilded Age Tale of Love and Deception Across the Color Line</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Like all of his remarkable scholarship, Karl Jacoby&#x2019;s <em>The Strange Career of William Ellis</em> takes an unexpected or little-known subject and, with great insight and imagination, uses it to shed new light on our larger past. He has excavated a life that began in obscurity and was ever being reinvented, and, in so doing, offers a deep understanding of the shifting boundaries of place, race, and social standing. An extraordinary story told with extraordinary skill.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Steven Hahn, Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning author of <em>A Nation under Our Feet</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[E]legantly written.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Vladimir Alexandrov, <em>San Francisco Chronicle</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;[A] welcome and nuanced perspective to the racial history of the U.S. as well as a textured examination of the legacy of distrust between the United States and Mexico. ...Ellis&#x2019; life is also a cracking good story, illustrated with intriguing photos and helpful maps topped off by an emotionally satisfying epilogue.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Sara Martinez, <em>Booklist</em></strong><br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating...

Immanuel Kant took the opportunity to investigate the purported truths and assumptions of his age. Two hundred years later, Michel Foucault wrote a response to Kant's initial essay, positioning Kant as the initiator of the discourse and critique of modernity. <i>The Politics of Truth</i> takes this initial encounter between Foucault and Kant, as a framework for its selection of unpublished essays and transcripts of lectures Foucault gave in America and France between 1978 and 1984, the year of his death. Ranging from reflections on the Enlightenment and revolution to a consideration of the Frankfurt School, this collection offers insight into the topics preoccupying Foucault as he worked on what would be his last body of published work, the three-volume History of Sexuality.

The worst of it is, Miles and his friends are starting to see double, and it takes a while to find out who is responsible.<i>Author's Note</i>:<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Vorkosigan Saga Reading Order Debate: The Chef Recommends</b><br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Many pixels have been expended debating the 'best' order in which to read what have come to be known as the Vorkosigan Books, the Vorkosiverse, the Miles books, and other names, since I neglected to supply the series with a label myself.&nbsp; The debate now wrestles with some fourteen or so volumes and counting, and mainly revolves around publication order versus internal-chronological order.&nbsp; I favor internal chronological, with a few caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> I have always resisted numbering my volumes; partly because, in the early days, I thought the books were distinct enough; latterly because if I ever decided to drop in a prequel somewhere (which in fact I did most lately with <i>Captain Vorpatril's Alliance</i>) it would upwhack the numbering system.&nbsp; Nevertheless, the books and stories do have a chronological order, if not a strict one.<br> &nbsp;<br> It was always my intention to write each book as a stand-alone so that the reader could theoretically jump in anywhere, yes, with that book that's in your hand <i>right now</i>, don't put it back on the shelf!&nbsp; While still somewhat true, as the series developed it acquired a number of sub-arcs, closely related tales that were richer for each other.&nbsp; I will list the sub-arcs, and then the books, and then the caveats.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Shards of Honor</i> and <i>Barrayar.</i>&nbsp; The first two books in the series proper, they detail the adventures of Cordelia Naismith of Beta Colony and Aral Vorkosigan of Barrayar.&nbsp; <i>Shards</i> was my very first novel ever; <i>Barrayar</i> was actually my eighth, but continues the tale the next day after the end of <i>Shards</i>.&nbsp; For readers who want to be sure of beginning at the beginning, or who are very spoiler-sensitive, start with these two.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> and <i>The Vor Game</i> (with, perhaps, the novella "The Mountains of Mourning" tucked in between.)&nbsp; <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> introduces the character who became the series' linchpin, Miles Vorkosigan; the first book tells how he created a space mercenary fleet by accident; the second how he fixed his mistakes from the first round. Space opera and military-esque adventure (and a number of other things one can best discover for oneself), <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i> makes another good place to jump into the series for readers who prefer a young male protagonist.<br> &nbsp;<br> After that: <i>Brothers in Arms</i> should be read before <i>Mirror Dance</i>, and both, ideally, before <i>Memory.</i><br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Komarr</i> makes another good alternate entry point for the series, picking up Miles's second career at its start.&nbsp; It should be read before <i>A Civil Campaign</i>.<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i>, a collection of three of the five currently extant novellas, makes a good Miles Vorkosigan early-adventure sampler platter, I always thought, for readers who don't want to commit themselves to length.&nbsp; (But it may make more sense if read after <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i>.)&nbsp; Take care not to confuse the collection-as-a-whole with its title story, "The Borders of Infinity".<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i> takes place 200 years earlier in the timeline and does not share settings or characters with the main body of the series.&nbsp; Most readers recommend picking up this story later. It should likely be read before <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i>, however, which revisits the "quaddies", a bioengineered race of free fall dwellers, in Miles's time.<br> &nbsp;<br> The novels in the internal-chronological list below appear in italics; the novellas (officially defined as a story between 17,500 words and 40,000 words, though mine usually run 20k - 30k words) in quote marks.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>Falling Free</i><br> <i>Shards of Honor</i><br> <i>Barrayar</i><br> <i>The Warrior's Apprentice</i><br> "The Mountains of Mourning"<br> "Weatherman"<br> <i>The Vor Game</i><br> <i>Cetaganda</i><br> <i>Ethan of Athos</i><br> <i>Borders of Infinity</i><br> "Labyrinth"<br> "The Borders of Infinity" <br> <i>Brothers in Arms</i><br> <i>Mirror Dance</i><br> <i>Memory</i><br> <i>Komarr</i><br> <i>A Civil Campaign</i><br> "Winterfair Gifts"<br> <i>Diplomatic Immunity</i><br> <i>Captain Vorpatril's </i><i>Alliance</i><i>&nbsp; </i>(upcoming in late 2012)<br> <i>CryoBurn</i><br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;<br> Caveats:<br> &nbsp;<br> The novella "Weatherman" is an out-take from the beginning of the novel <i>The Vor Game</i>.&nbsp; If you already have <i>The Vor Game</i>, you likely don't need this.<br> &nbsp;<br> The original 'novel' <i>Borders of Infinity</i> was a fix-up collection containing the three novellas "The Mountains of Mourning", "Labyrinth", and "The Borders of Infinity", together with a frame story to tie the pieces together. Again, beware duplication.&nbsp; The frame story does not stand alone, and generally is of interest only to completists.<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>The Fantasy Novels</b><br> &nbsp;<br> My fantasy novels are a bit easier to order.&nbsp; Easiest of all is <i>The Spirit Ring</i>, which is a stand-alone, or aquel, as some wag once dubbed books that for some obscure reason failed to spawn a subsequent series.&nbsp; Next easiest are the four volumes of <i>The Sharing Knife</i>--in order, <i>Beguilement</i>, <i>Legacy</i>, <i>Passage</i>, and <i>Horizon</i>--which I broke down and actually numbered, as this was one continuous tale divided into non-wrist-breaking chunks.<br> &nbsp;<br> What have come to be called the Chalion books, after the setting of its first two volumes, were also written, like the Vorkosigan books, to be stand-alones as part of a larger whole, and can in theory be read in any order.&nbsp; (The third book actually takes place a few hundred years prior to the more closely connected first two.)&nbsp; Some readers think the world-building is easier to assimilate when the books are read in publication order, and the second volume certainly contains spoilers for the first (but not the third.)&nbsp; In any case, the publication order is:<br> &nbsp;<br> <i>The Curse of Chalion</i><br> <i>Paladin of Souls</i><br> <i>The Hallowed Hunt</i><br> &nbsp;<br> Happy reading!<br> &nbsp;<br> -- Lois McMaster Bujold.</p><h2>501 Italian Verbs: with CD-ROM (501 Verb Series)</h2><p><b>Publisher's Note: Products purchased from Third Party sellers are not guaranteed by the publisher for quality, authenticity, or access to any online entitlements included with the product.<br><br> Learning Italian is easy with Barron&#x2019;s <i>501 Italian Verbs</i>.

All Huntingdon exclaimed on the greatness (8) of the match, and her uncle, the lawyer (9), himself, allowed her to be at least three thousand pounds short of any equitable claim to it (10). She had two sisters to be benefited by her elevation; and such of their acquaintance as thought Miss Ward and Miss Frances quite as handsome (11) as Miss Maria (12), did not scruple (13) to predict their marrying with almost equal advantage. But there certainly are not so many men of large fortune in the world, as there are pretty women to deserve them (14). Miss Ward, at the end of half a dozen years, found herself obliged to be attached to the Rev. Mr. Norris (15), a friend of her brother-in-law, with scarcely any private fortune, and Miss Frances fared yet worse. Miss Ward&#x2019;s match, indeed, when it came to the point, was not contemptible, Sir Thomas being happily able to give his friend an income in the living of Mansfield (16), and Mr. and Mrs. Norris began their career of conjugal felicity with very little less than a thousand a year (17). But Miss Frances married, in the common phrase, to disoblige her family (18), and by fixing on (19) a Lieutenant of Marines (20), without education, fortune, or connections (21), did it very thoroughly. She could hardly have made a more untoward choice.<br><br>ANNOTATIONS (on facing pages):<br><br>1. This is the only time that Jane Austen states at the outset of a novel how many years earlier her story began. One reason is that this novel provides by far the longest narrative (lasting several chapters) of the events leading up to the main action, including the heroine&#x2019;s childhood. As usual, Austen is careful and accurate in her dating. The main action begins approximately twenty-seven years after this opening event and transpires over one year. The concluding events sketched in the last few pages would logically span about two years and possibly a little more. For more detail, see the chronology, p. 853.<br>&nbsp;<br>2. Huntingdon is a town in eastern England and the county seat of Hunting�donshire. Since the time of this novel Huntingdonshire has been absorbed into the county of Cambridgeshire.<br>&nbsp;<br>3. In most wealthy families, women were allotted a fixed sum as their inheri�tance. It would serve as a dowry and go to her husband upon her marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>4. Grand homes were always given formal names. Many names included the word &#x201c;Park,&#x201d; for estates normally had ample grounds, and the name desig�nated the grounds as well as the house.<br>&nbsp;<br>5. The county of Northampton, or Northamptonshire, is in the Midlands of England; it is to the immediate west of Huntingdonshire. Jane Austen, who was never in Northamptonshire, probably set her story there because its dis�tance from Portsmouth, the home of the heroine, serves the plot by making travel between the two places difficult. Similar considerations determine her choice of settings for other novels. For these locations, see map, p. 882.<br>&nbsp;<br>6. A baronet was the highest rank in Britain below the aristocracy or peerage. It was a hereditary knighthood, which gave the holder the right to be known as &#x201c;Sir&#x201d; and his wife the right to be known as &#x201c;Lady&#x201d; but, unlike the peerage, conferred no legal or political privileges. Baronets and peers, as well as the untitled gentry who ranked just below them, derived most of their wealth from large landed estates, usually with grand residences like Mansfield Park at the center. This landed elite dominated British government and society.<br>&nbsp;<br>7. <i>handsome</i>: large. The word could also refer to the house&#x2019;s attractiveness, but in this context it probably refers mostly to its size.<br>&nbsp;<br>8. <i>greatness</i>: social eminence. This and its attendant privileges are what is <br>primarily meant by the &#x201c;consequences&#x201d; of the match.<br>&nbsp;<br>9. &#x201c;Lawyer&#x201d; at this time could mean either a barrister, who could try cases in court, or an attorney, who could not. The uncle is likely a barrister, for barristers were considered gentlemen (for what this means, see p. 17, note 67) while attorneys were looked down upon socially; having an uncle who was an attorney would have been a formidable barrier to marrying a baronet.<br>&nbsp;<br>10. Marriage choices among the wealthy were so heavily determined by con�siderations of fortune and social rank that people had a clear sense of how much wealth on the wife&#x2019;s side would normally be required to attract a hus�band of a specific social and economic level. Lawyers would be particularly aware of this, for much of their business involved negotiating and drawing up the complicated financial settlements that elite marriages involved.<br>&nbsp;<br>11. <i>handsome</i>: attractive. The word is frequently used in Austen&#x2019;s novels to describe women, with no masculine connotation intended.<br>&nbsp;<br>12. &#x201c;Miss Ward&#x201d; is the eldest. The oldest unmarried daughter in a family was referred to as &#x201c;Miss + last name&#x201d;; her younger sisters were referred to as &#x201c;Miss + first name,&#x201d; with the last name sometimes added. Later we learn that Maria was the next oldest, and Frances (or Fanny) the youngest (p. 734&#x2014;the latter is called &#x201c;some years her [Lady Betram&#x2019;s] junior&#x201d;).<br>&nbsp;<br>13. <i>scruple</i>: hesitate.<br>&nbsp;<br>14. This basic truth manifests itself throughout Austen&#x2019;s novels, and&#x2014;along with women&#x2019;s urgent need to marry due to the absence of alternative careers&#x2014;provides much of the novels&#x2019; dramatic tension. The reference to a woman&#x2019;s prettiness underlines the importance of looks as an asset. It is almost certain that her looks were what allowed Maria to make such an advantageous marriage, for, as is soon revealed, she has almost no other attractive qualities.<br>&nbsp;<br>15. &#x201c;Rev.,&#x201d; short for &#x201c;Reverend,&#x201d; indicates he is a clergyman. Clergymen were central to English rural society at this time. Jane Austen&#x2019;s father was a clergy�man, as were two of her brothers. Clergy tended to be closely connected to the landed elite, and usually ranked next in status in the rural hierarchy. The phrase &#x201c;obliged to be attached&#x201d; indicates that Miss Ward married for the sake of her husband&#x2019;s social and economic position rather than for love, which was not unusual.<br>&nbsp;<br>16. This living is the position as clergyman for Mansfield parish, which comes with a regular income. England was divided into parishes, which were units both of the church and of local government; each parish had a church and a clergyman belonging to the Church of England. The official state church enjoyed legal privileges and was where most people in England worshipped, including virtually everyone in rural areas like this one. In towns and cities, more people belonged to other denominations, though, while generally able to worship freely, they were still obligated to contribute to the official Anglican Church. The power to appoint someone to a church living was frequently in the hands of wealthy landowners, and it was standard for them to appoint friends and family members. Jane Austen&#x2019;s father was appointed to his living by a cousin, which allowed him to marry and start a family. For more on the system of church appointments, see p. 47, notes 3 and 6. <br>&nbsp;<br>17. This is a very comfortable income, though not nearly as grand as Sir Thomas&#x2019;s (which is never specified) undoubtedly is. &#x201c;Conjugal felicity&#x201d; was a common expression of the time, in this case used ironically, given the real motives behind the marriage.<br>&nbsp;<br>18. This society emphasized people&#x2019;s obligations to their family, which included taking into account the family&#x2019;s wishes and interests in one&#x2019;s marital decisions.<br>&nbsp;<br>19. <i>fixing on</i>: choosing, selecting.<br>&nbsp;<br>20. The Royal Marines was a corps of soldiers who were trained like army soldiers and had similar uniforms and weaponry, but were attached to the navy. Virtually every naval ship had a contingent of marines, who existed to participate in landing parties that were sent ashore, to assist in hand-to-hand combat when a ship directly grappled with an enemy ship, and to maintain order and discipline. Commissioned military officers were considered gentle�men, but those in the marines were lower in status than army or navy officers. One reason was that, whereas commissions in the other services either had to be purchased or required years of experience, neither was the case in the marines, so those seeking marine commissions frequently had humble back�grounds and poor qualifications. This, plus the fact that lieutenant was the lowest officer rank and promotion was difficult, would make such a figure an undesirable husband for a woman from a family that could give its daughters a decent dowry and whose other daughters had married a baronet and a clergy�man with a good living.<br>&nbsp;<br>21. <i>connections</i>: relations, family ties. Such ties were highly important, both for social prestige and for the practical benefits they could confer. This man&#x2019;s lack of them, along with his lack of education and private fortune (he would receive only a modest salary as a marine lieutenant), would add to his undesir�ability from the perspective of the bride&#x2019;s family.</p><h2>Eyelids of Morning</h2><p>This book documents the crocodile&#39;s profound influence on the native people of Africa as reflected in their myths, symbols, and everyday lives--and the devastating impact that these people, as well as hunters, explorers, and developers, have had on the crocodile&#39;s existence.</p><p>Originally published in 1973 and long out of print, this is Graham's account of his expedition to Lake Rudolf in Kenya to study the remaining Nile crocodile population there. The author, a conservation consultant, has a peculiarly ambiguous attitude: although he opposes the traditional view of crocodiles as contemptible, he rails against the sentimentality of conservationists who "cherish a fantasy of communion with a mysterious nature." But Graham offers an impressive narrative of the arduous task of hunting down crocs for ecological analysis, of their feeding habits, and of the effects of overcrowding. He imparts a wealth of information about the mythology of crocodiles (such as a g tale of the Egyptian city of Crocodilopolis), their evolution, habitat and diet. We also learn much about the Turkana, natives who inhabit the west side of Lake Rudolf. Many of Beard's more than 200 photographs depict an entrancing beauty, but others unnecessarily unsettle the reader with images of piles of crocodiles that have been skinned, dissected for scientific observation and cast aside. <br>Copyright 1990 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Neuroscience, Fourth Edition</h2><p>Neuroscience is a comprehensive textbook created primarily for medical, premedical, and undergraduate students.

Browne (Phiz) Dickens wrote of David Copperfield: &#39;Of all my books I like this the best&#39;. Millions of readers in almost every language on earth have subsequently come to share the author&#39;s own enthusiasm for this greatly loved classic, possibly because of its autobiographical form. Following the life of David through many sufferings and great adversity, the reader will also find many light-hearted moments in the company of a host of English fiction&#39;s greatest stars including Mr Micawber, Traddles, Uriah Heep, Creakle, Betsy Trotwood, and the Peggoty family.</p><p>Please note that this is an MP3-CD. This is also available on cassette.&#39;I really think I have done it ingeniously and with a very complicated interweaving of truth and fiction.&#39; So wrote Dickens of David Copperfield (1850), the novel he called his &#39;favourite child&#39;. Through his hero Dickens draws openly on his own life, as David Copperfield recalls his experiences from childhood to the discovery of his vocation as a successful novelist. Rosa Dartle, Dora, Steerforth and Uriah Heep are among the characters who focus the hero&#39;s sexual and emotional drives, and Mr Micawber, a portrait of Dickens&#39;s own father, evokes the mixture of love, nostalgia and guilt that, put together, make this Dickens&#39;s most quoted and best-loved novel.</p><h2>Time and Narrative, Volume 3 (Time &amp; Narrative)</h2><p><p>In the first two volumes of this work, Paul Ricoeur examined the relations between time and narrative in historical writing, fiction, and theories of literature. This final volume, a comprehensive reexamination and synthesis of the ideas developed in volumes 1 and 2, stands as Ricoeur's most complete and satisfying presentation of his own philosophy.<br> <br> Ricoeur's aim here is to explicate as fully as possible the hypothesis that has governed his inquiry, namely, that the effort of thinking at work in every narrative configuration is completed in a refiguration of temporal experience. To this end, he sets himself the central task of determing how far a poetics of narrative can be said to resolve the "aporias"&#x2014;the doubtful or problematic elements&#x2014;of time. Chief among these aporias are the conflicts between the phenomenological sense of time (that experienced or lived by the individual) and the cosmological sense (that described by history and physics) on the one hand and the oneness or unitary nature of time on the other. In conclusion, Ricoeur reflects upon the inscrutability of time itself and attempts to discern the limits of his own examination of narrative discourse.<br> <br> "As in his previous works, Ricoeur labors as an imcomparable mediator of often estranged philosophical approaches, always in a manner that compromises neither rigor nor creativity."&#x2014;Mark Kline Taylor, <i>Christian Century</i><br> <br> "In the midst of two opposing contemporary options&#x2014;either to flee into ever more precious readings . . . or to retreat into ever more safe readings . . . &#x2014;Ricoeur's work offers an alternative option that is critical, wide-ranging, and conducive to new applications."&#x2014;Mary Gerhart, <i>Journal of Religion</i></p></p><p><b>Paul Ricoeur</b> is the John Nuveen Professor Emeritus in the Divinity School, professor of philosophy, and a member of the Committee on Social Thought at the University of Chicago.

Don&#x2019;t worry, these recipes are easily multiplied!)</p><p>ANITA LO is an acclaimed chef who worked at Bouley and Chanterelle before opening the Michelin-starred restaurant annisa in the heart of Manhattan&#x2019;s Greenwich Village in 2000, which she ran until it closed in 2017. <i>Food &amp; Wine</i> named her one of ten Best New Chefs in America, and <i>The</i> <i>Village Voice</i> proclaimed her Best New Restaurant Chef.

She lives in New York City and on Long Island.<b>Introduction</b><br><br> I put the &#x201c;Lo&#x201d; in alone. I&#x2019;ve been dumped almost as many times as I&#x2019;ve been in relationships&#x2014;and I can count those on less than two hands. Spread over my 50 year life-span, that&#x2019;s a lot of solo meals! So if you take that&#x2014;coupled with my many years working as a professional chef&#x2014;it seems that I&#x2019;m particularly well-suited to write this book. Those chefs who say they can&#x2019;t cook for less than 40 people? Not me&#x2014;I can do math. It is my Asian birthright. <br><br> I&#x2019;m also fanatical about waste. Waste is what makes cooking for one, at least efficiently, so difficult. My parents were Chinese and my father survived the Cultural Revolution. Food, at least at some point during their lives, was scarce; as a result, I was taught never to waste one bit. In cooking school at the Ritz Escoffier in Paris we were taught to utilize every scrap, and at Bouley&#x2014;my first cooking job&#x2014;the sous chef used to look through our garbage cans to make sure we weren&#x2019;t wasteful. It is an economic issue, but also an ecological and social one. When I cook for myself, much of my food involves using the sometimes overlooked but just-as delicious parts of meat and vegetables. For example, I grew up eating broccoli stems as well as the florettes. Instead of discarding cabbage hearts, my mother gave them to me to snack on raw while we were cooking. We didn&#x2019;t use radish leaves, but they&#x2019;re virtually identical to turnip greens, so I generally cook those along with the root itself, which helps you include more dark green vegetables in your diet. And all those parts in the bag that comes inside of a chicken? If used properly, those parts are pure flavor &#x2013; and another meal. Plus, cooking this way is important if you&#x2019;re working with fresh ingredients or off a budget.<br><br> The hospitalitarian in me also dictates that meals should be balanced. (Yeah, chefs are neurotic.) There always MUST be a vegetable or two. And food should vary from day to day. It should be diverse in ingredients as well as in cultural provenance. Some days you&#x2019;ll want to eat light and healthy; on other days, butter is a perfectly good substitute for love. True hospitality extends to others and to oneself. Too often we forget about the latter. This book will help you to remember how to take care of yourself.<br><br> When I&#x2019;m cooking at home, I generally make ingredient-focused dishes that are fast and easy&#x2014;I leave the more complicated recipes for my professional life. I&#x2019;ll buy a whole chicken from a local, humane farmer, which might cost a little more, but I make sure that I use every bit. The first night I&#x2019;ll break it down and place the legs and wings in a vacuum sealer bag in usable portions to freeze. If I&#x2019;m alone I&#x2019;ll do the same with one side of the breast, and cook the other for dinner. The bones and neck and gizzard will go into a stock right away or into the freezer for a later date; and I&#x2019;ll either freeze the liver until I have enough to make a mousse or chopped liver, or I&#x2019;ll make a salad with it the next day, along with the heart, for a quick bistro lunch. Yes, dining alone doesn&#x2019;t mean you&#x2019;re misanthropic. Nor does it have to be depressing. Cooking and dining alone can be one of the most blissful and empowering experiences you can have. <br><br> This book is for urban dwellers who would like to cook a fabulous, sophisticated meal for themselves, regardless of their circumstance. Although I have a soft spot for the depressed, jilted single, SOLO is also for those who are happiest on their own; or those who may be part of a fractured family in all its forms&#x2014;quite often these days, even if we&#x2019;re not single, we are left alone due to our partner&#x2019;s work/family&#x2019;s social obligation. This book is also for those who may have different taste than their family or partner&#x2014;why shouldn&#x2019;t they eat what they crave? <br><br> I hope you&#x2019;ll find this book to be the ultimate guide to self-love through the best means possible&#x2014;delicious food&#x2014;and to celebrate the moments that you&#x2019;re alone. And if my reader happens to get a date or decides she or he wants to share, these recipes are easily multiplied by two. <br><br> After all, they say the way to a person&#x2019;s heart is through the stomach. So far, it has worked for me.</p><h2>Nursing Care Plans: Transitional Patient &amp; Family Centered Care (Nursing Care Plans and Documentation)</h2><p><b>Prepare your students for safe, collaborative clinical practice.</b><br>Focusing on the most important nursing care plans for practice, this updated edition of Carpenito&#x2019;s practical resource helps students learn how to create nursing care plans, effectively document care, and build clinical reasoning and decision-making skills.

It then moves on to systems, devoting most of its pages to an atlas of human anatomy. Starting from the head and neck and ending at the lower leg and foot, this section illustrates seven regions of the body, primarily employing computer-generated illustrations, but also incorporating cutaway diagrams and clear photos and microscopic and x-ray images. For each designated section of the body, double-page renderings of the skeletal, muscular, nervous, cardiovascular, and lymphatic and immune systems are presented, each clearly introduced and extensively labeled. The extraordinary detail of these pictures will give students an excellent understanding of the body's structure and organization, depicting, layer by layer, the organs that are normally &#x201c;packed closely together and nestled into cavities, with nerves and vessels twisting around....&#x201d; Other sections focus on &#x201c;How the Body Works,&#x201d; &#x201c;Life Cycle,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Diseases and Disorders,&#x201d; offering the same graphic detail.

For anyone who has ever had the urge to create art, this easy-to-use manual clearly explains the artist's essential tools and materials -- how to choose them, how to use them, and how to care for them. Packed with information on myriad techniques, from color use and composition to subject choice, and including tips from the professionals, here's everything painters and illustrators need to begin, develop, and perfect their craft. Over 500 color photographs, 200 original works of art, and an extensive list of suppliers complete the most comprehensive, inspirational, and affordable artists' instruction book available today.</p><p>Angela Gair is a painter, an art teacher, a regular contributor to art-education magazines, and the author of several art-instruction books. She lives in England.<p></p><p> This omnibus of a book serves as an all-around reference guide to the techniques and equipment for all painting and drawing media, and I do mean all. Emphasizing a partnership between personal vision and technical ability--the learning hand and the seeing eye--the editor brings together every conceivable step in the painting and drawing process, from support preparation to the final steps of protecting, matting and framing art. Areas of picturemaking often not attended to receive careful attention; for example, in the section on supports, there is in-depth information about the quality of different canvases--how to stretch, prime, size, tone and more. For drawing media (anything that makes a mark) advice is presented for colored pencils, charcoal, cont crayon, pastels, markers, and pen and ink, with an in-depth treatise on what to look for in drawing inks. 523 full-color photographs and 234 color drawings make the book a visual treat. Most pages have three or four color illustrations complemented by clear descriptive text. After dealing with varied aspects of all major media, Editor Gair also introduces pertinent material on color, composition, subjects, and themes. If your resource shelf has room for but one general book on drawing and painting, this inexpensive and informative volume can be recommended for secondary school level and beyond. </p></p><h2>MIDDLE GRADES SOCIAL STUDIES 2011 GEOGRAPHY STUDENT EDITION EASTERN HEMISPHERE</h2><p><p>Travel throughout the Eastern Hemisphere, where geography, history, 21st century skills, and personalized opportunities for learning provide comprehensive content coverage.</p></p><p></p><h2>Spies in the Congo: America&#39;s Atomic Mission in World War II</h2><p><b>In the 1940s, the brightest minds of the United States and Nazi Germany raced to West Africa with a single mission: to secure the essential ingredient of the atomic bomb and to make sure nobody saw them doing it</b><br><br>Albert Einstein told President Franklin D. Roosevelt in 1939 that the world's only supply of uniquely high-quality uranium ore the key ingredient for bomb could be found in the Katanga province of the Belgian Congo at the Shinkolobwe Mine.

P. Snow once remarked that not knowing the Second Law of thermodynamics was analogous to never having read a work of Shakespeare's. This profusproductely illustrated volume breaks down the mathematical barriers that have prevented many from understanding this fundamental principle of energy transformation and describes the origin, atomic basis, and wide-ranging applications of this central, unifying description of all natural change.<br><br>Simply stated, the Second Law recognizes the intrinsic asymmetry in nature. Aspects of this asymmetry can be found all around us: hot objects cool, but cool objects do not spontaneously become hot; a bouncing ball comes to rest, but a stationary ball does not spontaneously begin to bounce. Oxford professor P. W. Atkins begins his examination of these seemingly random but vitally important phenomena with early observations of the steam engine and traces the deepening understanding that emerged when the atomic basis of the Law was established. He analyzes the Law from a modern viewpoint, enabling us to see how a single, simple idea encompasses all elements of natural change.<br><br>Atkins explores this idea from its first recognition through its application in engines, refrigerators, and heat pumps to its role as the driving force of chemical reactions and, finally, to the emergence of the exquisitely ordered structures characteristic of life itself.<br><br>Using striking computer graphics to develop a unified picture of nature, the author shows us how structures are built apparently out of chaos until we grasp the underlying, awesome simplicity of complexity.

Foremost among them was Carl Linnaeus, a radical thinker who revolutionized biology.</strong></p><p>In <em>What Linnaeus Saw</em>, Karen Magnuson Beil chronicles Linnaeus&#x2019;s life and career in readable, relatable prose. As a boy, Linnaeus hated school and had little interest in taking up the religious profession his family had chosen. Though he struggled through Latin and theology classes, Linnaeus was an avid student of the natural world and explored the school&#x2019;s gardens and woods, transfixed by the properties of different plants. At twenty-five, on a solo expedition to the Scandinavian Mountains, Linnaeus documented and described dozens of new species. As a medical student in Holland, he moved among leading scientific thinkers and had access to the best collections of plants and animals in Europe. What Linnaeus found was a world with no consistent system for describing and naming living things&#x2015;a situation he methodically set about changing. The Linnaean system for classifying plants and animals, developed and refined over the course of his life, is the foundation of modern scientific taxonomy, and inspired and guided generations of scientists.</p><p><em>What Linnaeus Saw</em> is rich with biographical anecdotes&#x2015;from his attempt to identify a mysterious animal given him by the king to successfully growing a rare and exotic banana plant in Amsterdam to debunking stories of dragons and phoenixes. Thoroughly researched and generously illustrated, it offers a vivid and insightful glimpse into the life of one of modern science&#x2019;s founding thinkers.</p> 60 color illustrations</p><p><strong>Karen Magnuson Beil</strong> has worked as a news reporter and science writer.

The author has tried throughout the work to introduce, explain and illustrate the most significant features of the language and through verses, quotations, and readings. To these ends the grammar has been, in several areas, simplified to prevent the beginner from being more hampered than is absolutely necessary by relatively insignificant paradigms, rules and exceptions. Upon completion of this course, students should have a real working knowledge of the major outlines of Sanskrit sentences with some facility and read, with the help of dictionary, approximately five to ten verses of the Valmiki Ramayana or a similar text in an hour.</p><p>Robert P.

This is the final judgement of Satan on Victoria di Loredani, the heroine of Zofloya, or The Moor (1806), a tale of lust, betrayal, and multiple murder set in Venice in the last days of the fifteenth century. The novel follows Victoria's progress from spoilt daughter of indulgent aristocrats, through a period of abuse and captivity, to a career of deepening criminality conducted under Satan's watchful eye. Charlotte Dacre's narrative deftly displays her heroine's movement from the vitalized position of Ann Radcliffe's heroines to a fully conscious commitment to vice that goes beyond that of `Monk' Lewis's deluded Ambrosio. The novel's most daring aspect is its anatomy of Victoria's intense sexual attraction to her Moorish servant Zofloya that transgresses taboos both of class and race. A minor scandal on its first publication, and a significant influence on Byron and Shelley, Zofloya has been unduly neglected. Contradicting idealized stereotypes of women's writing, the novel's portrait of indulged desire, gratuitous cruelty, and monumental self-absorption retains considerable power to disturb. The introduction to this edition, the first for nearly 200 years, examines why Zofloya deserves to be read alongside established Gothic classics as the highly original work of an intriguing and unconventional writer.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years<strong> Oxford World's Classics </strong>has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

Strangely enough, the American colonies and the American slaves were engaged in a similar quest for freedom. In 1773 the colonists in America&#x2014;those people who lived in what would be the original thirteen states of the US&#x2014;decided they wanted to be free from the British government making all their laws. The enslaved people of America, who had been brought over from Africa and the Caribbean as part of the slave trade, wanted to be free to live as they chose. These fights for freedom as a country and as a race of people would become as much a part of Ona&#x2019;s life as waking up in the morning and breathing.<br> <br>But first Ona needs to be born.<br> <br>Ona&#x2019;s parents were Betty, a woman born into slavery in Virginia, and Andrew Judge, a white indentured servant from England whose labor had been bought by George Washington for forty-five dollars. (An indenture agreement meant that in return for Andrew&#x2019;s transport to America, as well as food, clothing, shelter, and a small cash allowance, Andrew&#x2019;s labor was owned for the next four years of his life by whoever purchased his agreement. Still, Andrew had small freedoms as an indentured servant that the enslaved population did not share.) Betty and Andrew were not married. It was illegal for a black person to marry a white person. In fact, it was illegal for slaves to be married at all.<br> <br>Betty had originally been owned by Daniel Parke Custis, Martha Washington&#x2019;s first husband, who died after only seven years of marriage. By this point in America, slavery was as entrenched as the roots of the biggest, oldest tree. Like the Custises, Martha&#x2019;s family (the Dandridges) owned slaves, as did Martha&#x2019;s second husband&#x2019;s family, the Washingtons. When Daniel died, his property was split three ways between Martha and their children. This property included both land and the humans owned by the Custises&#x2014;one of whom was Betty, Ona&#x2019;s mother. (This is the reason why Betty was always classified as a &#x201c;dower&#x201d; slave&#x2014;meaning that she would always be the property of Martha Washington and her heirs, no matter whom Martha married after Daniel.)<br> <br>After Martha married George Washington, she brought at least eighty-four slaves with her to Mount Vernon, about one hundred miles away from the main Custis estate. Betty was chosen to go and was allowed to take her two-year-old son, Austin. This was a big deal, because slave families were often split up after the death of the original owner. It may have also indicated that Betty had already established herself as one of Martha&#x2019;s more valued slaves. Certainly by 1773 she had become an important part of Martha Washington&#x2019;s team of seamstresses.<br> <br>Betty was the person whom many other seamstresses in the Washington household went to when they needed to learn how to hem a skirt or weave a certain fabric. She was also known as the person who could take a piece of expensive material from London and dye it the exact color Martha wanted without ruining the garment. The creation of clothing was an important job for anyone during colonial times, when fabric, not finished clothes, was what was available at a store, and every household needed someone who could use a needle and thread to stitch together garments for everyone&#x2014;black and white&#x2014;to wear. Betty&#x2019;s expertise at sewing and spinning kept her out of the fields of George Washington&#x2019;s five working farms. Instead she earned a place working in the spinning house. The spinning house was a building near the mansion where George and Martha lived, where the enslaved seamstresses did their work. Martha herself liked to sew, so sometimes Betty was a part of a larger sewing circle in the mansion, alongside her owner.<br> <br>Andrew Judge, Ona&#x2019;s father, was also an expert at sewing. Usually George Washington did not prefer white indentured servants. He complained that they were unreliable and lazy, yet George seemed to like and trust Andrew. He was one of George Washington&#x2019;s preferred tailors, eventually creating the blue uniform George wore when he was named commander in chief of the American forces in 1775.<br> <br>In 1773, however, George would have been surprised to learn that soon he would be leading the American military forces against the British. Although he was a well-known colonel and respected military man, George would have said his main occupation was farming. He was well aware of the political events that were stirring up the anger of the American colonists; he too felt strongly that Americans should not be ruled across an ocean by King George III of England. He knew that many colonists wanted to form a new country with their own form of democratic government. Yet like many of his friends and acquaintances, George had protected British control of American land. Like his father and grandfather, George was also a member of the colonial government in Virginia. Turning publicly against his ancestors and the reigning monarch would be a massive and dangerous step.<br> <br>Neither George nor the country was quite ready to take such a step. But change was in the air, and it was Mother Nature herself who, by throwing a snowball, got the attention of not only George, but Betty, too.<br> <br>In June 1773 the unimaginable happened. It snowed in Virginia. Farmers like George Washington needed to rely on familiar weather patterns, but it was anything but familiar for snow to fall this far south in June. Mount Vernon&#x2019;s crops were at risk, and the people on the plantation were confused. Many of the enslaved saw the late snow as an omen bringing something bad upon the people of Mount Vernon. Other enslaved people believed the snow meant that something good was about to happen. Both turned out to be right.<br> <br>Eight days after the snow fell, Patsy, the daughter of Martha Washington and her first husband, became terribly ill. Only seventeen, Patsy had been plagued by seizures that had begun during her teenage years. There was no effective treatment for Patsy&#x2019;s condition. Instead the doctors who cared for Patsy would treat her with bloodletting&#x2014;drawing out her blood as a way to stop the seizures. It never worked.<br> <br>It was shortly after four o&#x2019;clock on June 19 when Patsy excused herself after dinner to get a letter from her bedroom. When she didn&#x2019;t come back, her soon-to-be sister-in-law, Eleanor Calvert, went to check on her. Patsy lay on the floor of her room, in the middle of a violent seizure. Though Eleanor called for help immediately, there was very little anyone could do. Within two minutes Patsy was dead.<br> <br>George Washington, Patsy&#x2019;s stepfather, was devastated. Martha Washington was almost destroyed. When she had been married to her first husband, Martha had borne four children: Daniel, Frances, Jacky, and Patsy. The oldest two children had died when they were toddlers. To lose another child was pushing Martha off an emotional cliff.<br> <br>In a letter written to his nephew, George Washington stated, &#x201c;I scarce need add [that Patsy&#x2019;s death] has almost reduced my poor Wife to the lowest ebb of Misery.&#x201d;<br> <br>Everyone at Mount Vernon was aware of Martha&#x2019;s pain, especially the enslaved women whom she had chosen to work near her in the mansion. Betty, Ona&#x2019;s mother, was one of these women.<br> <br>Only seven years younger than Martha, Betty had already watched Martha as she&#x2019;d endured the deaths of her first husband and first two children. She understood how painful it was for Martha to lose another child, especially because by this time Betty had two other children besides Austin, and she knew how desperate she would have been if any of them had died.<br> <br>She may have stood near Martha&#x2019;s bedside, comforting her in her terrible grief while at the same time helping the household prepare for Patsy&#x2019;s funeral. It would not have been relevant to Martha that Betty was pregnant at this time; the fact that she and Andrew Judge were going to have a baby was not and could not be Betty&#x2019;s priority.<br> <br>We do not know what kind of relationship Andrew and Betty had. They may have fallen in love. They may have had the kind of relationship that is the opposite of love, the kind of nonconsensual encounter where a man uses his strength and privilege to overpower the woman. The truth is that Andrew Judge could have raped Betty, and she would have been unable to do anything about it. His status as a white man would have protected him, just as it did the white male owners who commonly raped the women they owned.<br> <br>Still, it is also possible that Betty entered into this relationship with aims of her own besides romantic love. Perhaps she believed that having a relationship with Andrew could lead to her own freedom and that of her children, because she knew that in a few years Andrew would become a free man. At that time he could potentially offer to buy all of them from the Washingtons. We will never know Betty&#x2019;s feelings. All we do know is that Andrew Judge did eventually claim his freedom, but he did not take Betty and his child with him. If he loved Betty, it was not enough to keep him from leaving.<br> <br>Still, in 1773, Andrew was living at Mount Vernon. And sometime during or close to that year, after the strange snowfall and after Patsy&#x2019;s funeral, Betty gave birth to their daughter. They named her Ona Maria Judge. While there are few records about the births and deaths of slaves, this girl child, of mixed race, would, as a young woman, walk that tightrope of freedom for African Americans long before her bold descendants-in-spirit, Harriet Tubman and Frederick Douglass, made their own escapes from slavery.<br> <br>Like her mother, Betty, Ona learned how to persevere in the face of extreme hardship. Like her father, Ona would eventually free herself no matter who she left behind. Finally, like America itself, Ona would risk everything so that she, too, could achieve those rights written in the Declaration of Independence: life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p><h2>The Haj: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;The narrative is fast paced, bursting with action, and obviously based on an intimate grasp of the region, its peoples, their tradition and age-old ways of life.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>John Barkham Reviews<br></i></b><br>Leon Uris retums to the land of his acclaimed&nbsp;&nbsp;best-seller <i>Exodus</i> for an epic story of hate and love, vengeance and forgiveness and&nbsp;&nbsp;forgiveness.

That is, until the son of a rich banker and his wife are found murdered. To the police it looks like a robbery gone awry. But then Koko develops an odd appetite for glue. Qwill doesn&#x2019;t spot the clue until his beloved Siamese&#x2019;s taste for paste tangles them in a web of love, danger, and their stickiest case yet!</p><p>The history of <b>Lilian Jackson Braun</b> is perhaps as exciting and mysterious as her novels. Between 1966 and 1968, she published three novels to critical acclaim:&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Could Read Backwards, The Cat Who Ate Danish Modern</i>,&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Turned On and Off</i>.&nbsp; In 1966,&nbsp;the<i> New York Times</i>&nbsp;labeled Braun, &#x201c;the new detective of the year.&#x201d; Then, for reasons unknown, the rising mystery author disappeared from the publishing scene. It wasn&#x2019;t until 1986 that Berkley Publishing Group reintroduced Braun to the public with the publication of an original paperback,&nbsp;<i>The Cat Who Saw Red</i>. Within two years, Berkley released four new novels in paperback and reprinted the three mysteries from the sixties. Since then, G.P. Putnam&#x2019;s Sons has published seventeen additional novels in the Cat Who series. Braun passed away in 2011.In this tame, nonmysterious mystery, bucolic Pickax City, in Moose County ("400 miles north of everywhere") is first disrupted by vandalism, then by murder. When Harley Fitch, vice-president of the Pickax Bank, and his wife, Belle, are found shot to death, police chief Brodie, a bagpipe-playing Scotsman, thinks that vandals, from neighboring, low-class Chipmonk are responsible. After three of the suspects die in a car accident, the case is effectively closed. But Jim Qwilleran ("former journalist, now heir to the Klingenschoen fortunea big man about 50, with graying hair, bushy moustache and doleful expression") doesn't agree. Involved though he is in starting up a newspaper, juggling several platonic romances, redecorating his house and spoiling his Siamese cats, Koko and Yum Yum, he finds time to snoop around. He doesn't discover anything, except for the spotted pasts of the deceased. Eventually, the killer attacks Qwilleran and his identity is made known; there are no clues, no logical way for the reader to figure out whodunit. The author's device of introducing every scene with stage directions, and her reliance on stereotypical characters, may bore even the readers who find Koko and Yum Yum as irresistible as Braun ( The Cat Who Knew Shakespeare , The Cat Who Played Post Office ) does.

Old Dog Zero One is put to the test in a mission to the Soviet Union in this novel written in the waning days of the Cold War. The target is a new Soviet weapon responsible for knocking an American spy satellite out of commission. Richard Allen brings a military bearing to the story, relating techno-jargon, action, and grunts' gripes alike with a commanding tone that makes the adventure more compelling and believable. Although dated, the Cold War story that launched Dale Brown's career in 1987 is still fun.

Lewis: The Gift of Friendship</h2><p>Reveals the complex friendship between the two literary figures, noting their shared academic experiences at Oxford University, Lewis&#39;s influence on Tolkien&#39;s completion of The Lord of the Rings, and the differences in their temperaments and spiritual beliefs. Original.</p><p>Colin Duriez has written and lectured extensively on both Tolkien and C.S.Lewis and their creations Middle-earth and Narnia. He is the author, most recently, of Tolkien and the Lord of the Rings: A Guide to Middle-Earth (HiddenSpring, 1-58768-017-3), The C. S. Lewis Encyclopedia, and, with David Porter, The Inklings Handbook. He lives in a house full of books near the city of Leicester, England.The two most successful twentieth-century English fantasists were friends from shortly after their 1926 meeting until the younger's death. Both fought in World War I, in which all but one of Tolkien's dearest school friends died, and Lewis lost a buddy whose mother he thereafter cared for, as promised, until her 1951 death. As young Oxford dons, they discovered they shared a love of medieval northern European literature and, after Lewis (1898-1963), greatly aided by Tolkien (1892-1973), converted to Christianity, a common faith. Lewis' great aid to Tolkien was to encourage unflaggingly the development of <i>The Lord of the Rings.</i> Tolkien reciprocated Lewis' supportiveness for Lewis' fiction and scholarship but was too conservative a Catholic to approve of the low-church Anglican Lewis' popular Christian evangelical writings and especially his limited toleration of divorce, which apparently seemed adventitious even to Lewis when he married divorcee Joy Davidman and never told Tolkien. In a graceful, sympathetic, and appealing dual biography, Duriez stresses their influences on one another and the depths of their friendship. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Luckily, there's no need to compromise luxurious, effective skin and hair care for safety. From a leader in the world of natural beauty, <i>Wild Beauty</i> is an inspiring and highly usable guide to harnessing the miraculous power of plants to make your own face oils, body balms, hairspray, bath salts, and more. Jana Blankenship, founder of the popular beauty company Captain Blankenship, believes that organic beauty products create a direct link with nature, and ingredients like cold pressed organic plant oils, flowers, seaweeds, sea salt, and organic essential oils not only conjure the natural world, but are highly beneficial for our skin, body, hair, and senses. <i>Wild Beauty </i>also shows you how to create powerful essential oil blends, the building blocks to effective skin and hair care, that can be used on their own to relieve headaches and tension, elevate mood, or be worn as natural perfumes. With gorgeous photographs and tips on creating a meaningful self-care regimen, this is the only book you need for true, holistic beauty.</p><p>JANA BLANKENSHIP started her nautically inspired beauty company Captain Blankenship in 2009 while living in Berkeley, California, and inspired by the eucalyptus groves and blooming jasmine around her.

The perfumer creates work that is more than a sum of its parts, like an alchemist who transmutes matter into spirit. Perfume reacts differently on each body it touches because everyone&#x2019;s body chemistry and sense of smell are different. In addition, each plant essence has its own structure that, when combined into a perfume, becomes something else entirely, a harmonious work of art. A perfume is traditionally made of base notes, middle notes, and top notes, which is a direct reference to music. When certain scents align and enhance each other, they are called chords. To create a well-balanced perfume is to develop a real harmony, one in which each element depends on the others to make it sing. Let&#x2019;s delve into how we grow a harmonious perfume from the ground up.<br> &nbsp;<br> In a simple blend, you could choose one base note, one middle note, and one top note to start. In more complicated perfumes, you could have three or four of each note. Before diving in, it is helpful to take some time to reflect on the character of the perfume you want to create. If you want orange blossom to be a star in your perfume, you should try not to bury it with heavier scents. Take some time to brainstorm before you start blending. You can always add more drops, but you cannot subtract them. There is nothing sadder than creating mud out of precious materials and needing to start over.<br> &nbsp;<br> In this chapter, I want to introduce you to some of my favorite essential oils and then some simple recipes for scent blends for well-being, room sprays, and perfumes. That said, scent is entirely subjective, and you may have different preferences than I do. Feel free to adjust the scent blends to your liking, and above all, trust your nose. You are the most important ingredient.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Base Notes</b><br> Mandy Aftel uses the metaphor of a tree to talk about plant essences. The base notes are the roots of the tree, the resinous scents that build the foundation of a perfume. They often are made from actual roots, like vetiver. Other popular base notes include frankincense, myrrh, vanilla, patchouli, palo santo, sandalwood, seaweed, oak moss, and violet leaf. These base notes are heavy, rich, and syrupy in smell and are what gives perfume longevity. When building<br> a perfume, you work from the ground up.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Middle Notes</b><br> From the roots, we come to the flowers and leaves of the tree: the middle notes, which are the precious heart of a scent. Flowers such as jasmine, rose, tuberose, ylang ylang, geranium, and orange blossom are middle notes. Leaves, needles, and grasses are also in this category, including eucalyptus, pine, spruce, cypress, and palmarosa.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Top Notes</b><br> The first wave of a perfume that you smell are the top notes, but they are fleeting. The top notes, the fruits of the tree, also include spices and herbs. All citrus fruits, spices, and most herbs are classified as top notes.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>A Note on Ingredients</b><br> I suggest using organic and wild-harvested essential oils, organic CO2 extracts, and organic carrier oils, but you can experiment and see what you like best. As always, follow your nose.<br> &nbsp;<br> Citrus essential oils should be kept in the fridge to keep them fresh. I like to use golden jojoba oil (not deodorized) for scent blends, but sunflower and safflower are also options. All three carrier oils are easily absorbed by the skin and don&#x2019;t carry much of a scent themselves, making them the perfect vehicle for essential oils.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>A Note on Blending</b><br> Please think of these as sketches that you can adapt to your liking. Scent is personal, and you should feel free to make changes and substitutions and make these your own work of art. Always remember you can add, but you can&#x2019;t subtract. Start slow with drops and add more if you desire. Cutting up scent strips made out of small strips of drawing paper and dipping them into your draft is a good way to get a sense of where the scent is and where you want to take it.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Equipment</b><br> Most of the equipment used in these recipes includes common kitchen items, such as a small pot, small strainer, mixing bowls, large and small heatproof spouted glass measuring cups, measuring spoons, metal spoons for stirring, spatula, and metal funnel. You will also need eyedroppers.<br> &nbsp;<br> All of the 1/2-ounce recipes require glass aromatherapy roll-on bottles (use either a single 1/2-ounce bottle or two 1/4-ounce bottles). All of the 4-ounce recipes require 4-ounce glass bottles with fine-mist sprayers. Additional items will be noted after the ingredient lists.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Loosen the Knot Tension-Release Blend</b><br> This powerful blend of essential oils is great for relieving anxiety, tension, headaches, migraines, and PMS. Dab onto wrists and temples, breathe in, and close your eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yield: 1/2 ounce<br> &nbsp;<br> Ingredients<br> 1 tablespoon carrier oil of choice<br> 8 drops peppermint essential oil<br> 7 drops eucalyptus essential oil<br> 5 drops clary sage essential oil<br> 3 drops rosemary essential oil<br> Optional: 5 drops lavender essential oil*<br> &nbsp;<br> *Use if you or your friends love lavender; some people don&#x2019;t.<br> &nbsp;<br> 1. Add carrier oil to small spouted measuring cup. With separate eyedroppers, add essential oils to carrier oil and combine with spoon. With funnel, pour slowly into roll-on bottles. Press on roll-on lid and screw on cap.<br> &nbsp;<br> 2. Use as needed. If stored out of direct sunlight, will keep for up to 2 years.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>Cocoa &amp; Spice Face Mask &amp; Exfoliant</b><br> This is a sumptuous mask and gentle exfoliant that I love in wintertime, but it is a great year-round treatment. It smells like spicy cocoa and soothes and clarifies skin without drying it out. Using activated charcoal and bentonite clay, which detoxify, along with antioxidant-rich<br> raw cocoa powder and a potent blend of invigorating spices will leave your skin and senses feeling revived.<br> &nbsp;<br> Yield: 1 1/2 ounces<br> &nbsp;<br> Ingredients<br> 1 tablespoon bentonite clay or kaolin clay<br> 1 teaspoon activated bamboo charcoal powder<br> 1 tablespoon raw cocoa powder<br> 1 teaspoon ground turmeric<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground nutmeg<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon<br> 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger<br> &nbsp;<br> Additional Equipment<br> 2-ounce glass jar with lid<br> &nbsp;<br>Mix all ingredients together in small bowl. Pour into jar and close with lid. Will keep fresh for up to a year.<br> &nbsp;<br> AS FACE MASK<br> Combine 1/2 teaspoon mix with 1/8 teaspoon water or hydrosol in small dish. Mix into paste and add more liquid if necessary for desired consistency. Apply to moist face and neck with fingers or brush. Leave on for 5 to 10 minutes, then rinse with lukewarm water. Pat dry with clean towel; apply toner and face oil or face balm.<br> &nbsp;<br> AS EXFOLIANT<br> Apply quarter-size amount to wet face with fingers, massage gently into skin, and rinse with lukewarm water.

Her nine-week trip to Hawai'i resulted in more than 20 paintings, which reveal that O'Keeffe--most commonly associated with the stark deserts of New Mexico--was profoundly inspired by what she saw and experienced on the lush, tropical Hawaiian Islands. The exhibition <i>Georgia O'Keeffe: Visions of Hawai'i</i>, and this accompanying volume, explores this little-known chapter in the artist's career. Glowing with color, these paintings demonstrate O'Keeffe's unique ability to make any place her own. This landmark volume offers a unique perspective by foregrounding the ecological complexity that is hidden behind O'Keeffe's depictions of Hawai'i-one of the most biologically diverse places on Earth. <br><b>Published in association with The New York Botanical Garden.</b><br><br>With contributions by Brian M.

We got a weekly brief on the latest intelligence from the world&#x2019;s hot spots, which actually made things worse. We all wanted to be working, conducting actual missions. But during standby, all we could do was plan for missions that would probably never happen. Overseas it was common to get a mission, put together a plan, and execute it a few hours later. But most of the operations we were involved in during standby were spur-of-the-moment contingency operations that would eventually disappear. We&#x2019;d spin up, plan the operation, only to spin back down as Washington decided on another option, or the hot spot cooled off. Making it worse, we were living at home, but we had very little time actually being at home with family. We had to keep our families at arm&#x2019;s length because we never knew when we&#x2019;d suddenly be gone. I&#x2019;d stick them in the same compartment in my brain that I used during deployments. For me, I was gone during standby, even if my parents could call me on the phone.</p><p>I know it was the same for every teammate. We all just wanted to get into the action.</p><p>It was early evening and I&#x2019;d just finished dinner. We weren&#x2019;t supposed to drink or party on standby. The last thing anybody wanted to do was show up drunk for a possible mission. I was looking at a lazy night in front of the TV when I received a series of text messages about a helicopter crash. The messages all read the same.</p><p>&#x201c;There&#x2019;s a<i> </i>CH-47 down in Afghanistan. Ours?&#x201d;</p><p>It was what we call &#x201c;rumint,&#x201d; a mix of real news and rumor that oftentimes turned into bullshit. Unfortunately, this time it would turn out to be true.</p><p>I had to see only one text before my mind started turning. If it was true, it didn&#x2019;t matter if it was SEALs, Delta, or Special Forces. They were teammates in the same fight. I called a good friend of mine who was on the squadron that was overseas. He wasn&#x2019;t with his team because he was home taking care of his mother, who was sick. I thought he might know something.</p><p>No answer.</p><p>I kept scrolling through my phone, calling anyone who might have information. Then I got the confirmation.</p><p>&#x201c;It was ours.&#x201d;</p><p>The news hit me like an electric charge. In my head, I could see all of my buddies in that squadron. My cell phone buzzed as the news spread. The same message kept coming up.</p><p>&#x201c;It was ours.&#x201d;</p><p>My stomach hurt. I couldn&#x2019;t sit still. I paced in my kitchen, my head down, scrolling through texts, waiting for more information, but dreading each new piece. I knew my teammates had all volunteered countless times to be in that exact place, doing what they were doing. It could have easily been me in the helicopter. Hell, I&#x2019;d been in a helicopter crash a few months earlier. It was harder being back at home waiting for word, a feeling most of our wives and girlfriends knew all too well.</p><p>After a while, I couldn&#x2019;t be alone. I grabbed a twelve-pack of beer from the fridge and walked down the street to a fellow SEAL&#x2019;s house. We were going to need a few beers tonight.</p><p>The sun was fading and the streets were deserted. As I walked the few blocks to my buddy&#x2019;s house, I looked around the neighborhood. The development was new, with few trees. Large brick houses sat on manicured lawns. On the weekends, I watched my neighbors stress over their lawns, mowing and manicuring the bushes to perfection. It made the streets look peaceful.</p><p>Most of my neighbors were oblivious to what I or any of the guys who came to my house did when they were at work. As I walked past the houses, I was sure my neighbors were thinking about summer vacation plans, bills, or what baseball game they were going to watch that night. It struck me how wide the chasm was between what was going on in Afghanistan and what was happening at home. I knew my neighbors cared and supported the troops, but they had no idea what it was like and how often my teammates risked their lives. The war was largely absent from daily life at home except for the families left behind to wait for their sailor or soldier to return.</p><p>They would never understand the amount of sacrifice being performed by our military on a daily basis. There was nothing I could do to change that, and tonight, it really didn&#x2019;t matter. The sacrifice was made. Now it was left to us to make sure it wasn&#x2019;t forgotten. The disconnect between those of us who put our lives on the line and the rest of the country was never as stark for me as it was on that quiet night.</p><p>When I got to my buddy&#x2019;s house, he opened the door with the same pained look on his face as I had. He just nodded and motioned me to come inside. I walked silently to his refrigerator and dropped off the beer. I grabbed two bottles and we quickly retreated to his back deck, leaving his family alone in the living room.</p><p>I popped off the top of my beer and took a long drink. The beer didn&#x2019;t taste like anything. I was just seeking the effect. My buddy silently drank his and scrolled through the messages on his phone. We sat for a while. Neither of us spoke. The helicopter was full of our friends, and they were all lost. It was a paralyzing feeling because all we wanted was to act, but there was nothing we could do.</p><p>The sun had finally set, and it was completely dark on the deck. I could barely make out my buddy&#x2019;s face in the shadows. He didn&#x2019;t bother to turn on the back light. I think we were both glad for the darkness. It made the grieving a little easier.</p><p>For months politicians and the media had been celebrating the SEAL teams after the Osama bin Laden mission. I don&#x2019;t know how many times I&#x2019;d heard the word &#x201c;hero&#x201d; thrown around. &#x201c;Hero&#x201d; is not a word we use easily, and it had gotten to the point where it had lost all meaning in our community. Everyone was a hero now.</p><p>The weight of the losses didn&#x2019;t really hit in earnest until names started to appear on my iPhone screen.</p><p>We tipped back beer after beer as we recounted stories about the guys on the helicopter. We both tried hard to remember the best stories, the funny stories, about each guy. There was no shortage. Humor gets us through the toughest and most stressful moments. We reached back in our memories for anything that would bring up a laugh. My buddy was inside grabbing a couple more beers when a new name popped up on my phone.</p><p>Ray.</p><p>It hit me like a gut punch. I set the phone down on the table and started to pace along the wooden boards of the deck. I met Ray for the first time in 1999 on the beach in San Diego. We were both about to start BUD/S, the SEAL training course. He&#x2019;d been to college in Louisiana. He completed a year before giving in to his desire to be a SEAL. I had made it through college before I&#x2019;d finally succumbed to the same lifelong itch. I remember standing next to Ray in the sand, looking at the surf, and listening to the instructors yell at us. He looked determined, focused. All the noise and chaos didn&#x2019;t seem to affect him at all.</p><p>Ray came across as a bit quiet until you got to know him. Unlike me, he was a natural athlete. He had been a soccer player in high school, and he had that lean physique. Over time I would see Ray naturally excel at most of the physical challenges that the instructors could throw at him. What made him so solid was his consistency. He always finished whatever we were doing&#x2014;a swim, a beach run, the obstacle course&#x2014;at or near the front of the pack, no matter the conditions.</p><p>We both graduated BUD/S in December 1999. Ray was stationed at SEAL Team Three. I was assigned to SEAL Team Five. Since we were both based in San Diego, we saw each other as often as possible. However, with our busy schedules, we were usually on different sides of the globe.</p><p>Ray had a black cat&#x2019;s nine lives.</p><p>Some of his close calls had become legend. Ray got shot in the neck a few months before he screened for selection and training, or S&amp;T. He was on a six-month deployment to Guam with SEAL Team Three. He and some of his friends had gone to a bar to celebrate Christmas. After a minor altercation with some locals, Ray and his fellow SEALs decided to call it a night. They climbed into a taxi and were headed back to the base when one of the guys from the bar, hanging out of the window of a nearby car, opened fire.</p><p>The bullets smashed into the taxi&#x2019;s windows. One of the bullets struck Ray in the neck, traveling clean through. Larry, another SEAL in the taxi, got hit in the ear. The bullet came out of his nose. The taxi driver rushed them both to the hospital. Ray stanched the blood with his shirt and walked into the emergency room for treatment.</p><p>A couple months later he showed up for S&amp;T. He was in my class and we made it through together, but just like after BUD/S, we wound up assigned to different squadrons.</p><p>Now Ray was dead. I still didn&#x2019;t believe it.</p><p>My buddy came back with another round of beers, shaking me out of my funk. We sat for a few more minutes silently. We both had our phones out, scrolling through the messages. But I was still thinking about Ray.</p><p>&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;You ever see that footage of Ray in Afghanistan?&#x201d;</p><p>My buddy gave a knowing chuckle.</p><p>&#x201c;If it were me, I&#x2019;d be dead,&#x201d; my buddy said.</p><p>Most mornings when we got into work and checked our email, there would be an After Action Review (AAR) waiting for us. An AAR is a report, sometimes including video footage from overhead drone coverage, generated by everyone involved in a mission. Everyone from the helicopter pilots to the intelligence analysts to the SEALs discussed all the things that went right and all the things that went wrong during the night&#x2019;s mission. These AARs were distributed within the community so that, whether you were on the mission or not, you could learn the same lessons that the team on the ground had learned. It also gave us a lot to talk about after a particularly interesting mission.</p><p>Ray&#x2019;s mission was a must-see. Ray&#x2019;s squadron had been in Afghanistan. His troop was assaulting a cluster of buildings behind a mud wall. Ray was one of the lead snipers and had climbed on top of a nearby building overlooking the compound where the Taliban commander was holed up, so that he could provide cover for the assaulters.</p><p>As I watched the footage, I could make out the assaulters moving silently toward the target compound. I had done the same thing a million times, so I knew exactly how those guys felt. I was still getting excited just watching them. I knew their senses were on fire, listening for an opening door or the crunch of stones under a pair of Taliban Cheetah sneakers. I caught myself scanning the walls of the compound looking for some movement.</p><p>As Ray set up to cover the assaulters, he took each step with care. I&#x2019;m sure every creak of the thin mud roof gave him pause, knowing a wrong move would give away his position to people who could be sleeping in the house.</p><p>As the assault force closed in on the target, a door directly under Ray&#x2019;s position was thrown open from the inside. Then the distinct shape of an RPG&#x2014;the thin tube with a cone-shaped warhead on the front&#x2014;poked out. There was a brief pause, maybe a few seconds. I guessed someone inside Ray&#x2019;s building had heard him on the roof or had heard the assaulters patrolling the compound. The Taliban fighter was probably trying to make out the approaching SEALs in the dark. Seconds later, the rocket raced out, cutting a path right in front of the assaulters and detonating some distance away.</p><p>The shock wave from the backblast created by the RPG was powerful enough to cause the mud roof to collapse. The middle of the roof opened like a giant mouth and swallowed Ray, dropping him in the middle of the house.</p><p>Ray landed on a heap of broken wooden beams and mud. He immediately saw five Taliban fighters through the dust cloud, holding AK-47 assault rifles and wearing chest racks carrying extra magazines. A few were lying on the floor, stunned by the RPG&#x2019;s backblast.</p><p>Ray had only a few seconds to make a decision: stay in the room and shoot the five fighters or get out of the house before his fellow SEALs, who might not have seen him fall, opened fire on the building.</p><p>Ray decided to get out of the house.</p><p>He spotted a window and crashed through it. On the footage, I saw Ray fall out of the window in a heap, landing at the base of the wall. Ray yelled to his teammates, identifying himself as one of the good guys. He hoped his fellow assaulters would realize he wasn&#x2019;t one of the Taliban. The footage showed Ray rolling away from the window and calmly pulling out a grenade. Crouching under the lip of the windowsill, he tossed the grenade into the house. From the drone feed, I thought Ray looked calm. All of his movements were smooth and fluid. He had a way of making something crazy look easy.</p><p>Ray rolled away from the open window and dove for some cover. The grenade exploded and sent a cloud of debris out of the hole in the roof. Inside the house, the shrapnel cut down the fighters.</p><p>Ray, like many of us, had served his country for more than a decade in some pretty hairy conditions. His actions reinforced the concepts we live by for the whole team, and I know that watching Ray operate at the peak of his ability made us more effective and saved lives down the line.</p><p>As I sat on my buddy&#x2019;s deck, I wished I&#x2019;d had one more chance to have a beer with Ray. For the rest of the night, we talked about our fallen brothers and tried to forget everything else. It didn&#x2019;t matter how they died. It mattered only that they were gone.</p><p>Days later, details started to come in about the crash. It was important that we learned from it, like we did from Ray&#x2019;s mission. The lost guys had been part of a quick reaction force that night. The QRF is a standby unit, often waiting near a mission, that is ready to act as reinforcement at a m...</p></p><h2>Batman Vol. 5: Rules of Engagement (Rebirth)</h2><p><b>When Catwoman accepted Batman's marriage proposal, she changed more lives than just Bruce Wayne's and Selina Kyle's.

I felt them like fishhooks in me, dragging me upward. I felt wrong. Cold. The image of Bordelon's face on the holograph-moments before I wiped it from existence-seemed to float on the air. His was not alone. Gilliam's was there, lips twisted as he was, a sneer made flesh. And Uvanari. A confusion of sound filled my universe: the screams of dying men, the cheering of the Colosso crowd, my own blood pounding in my ear.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I knew then, knew that I had been dead, and that all this sensory weight was the cost and burden of consciousness returning. Of being alive. I was alive. Again.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Lord Commandant?" A familiar voice, strangely accented, hinting at a language I could not remember-if indeed I knew it at all. "Lord Commandant?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was hiding in a basement on Pharos, that was it. There was a woman with me, a woman I loved, her hair blacker than the shadows. We were hiding from Bordelon and the Normans after they sold us to Admiral Whent. No. No, that was a long time ago, and a long time since Emesh, but my confused brain drank the scent of her and of burning wood, recalling the warmth of her and the taste of the ration bars we had shared alone in the darkness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Lord Commandant?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The fog was clearing, retreating into the depths of history and of time as yet uncounted. I could still hear shouts, sobs, and I knew they were my own, conducted through bone and time to make me feel and see the horrors of my past because to know them was to be alive. Hard fingers tore my clothes that night in Borosevo, Cat's body sank into the canals . . . At once sharp as new experience, my memories retreated from me like votive lanterns to the skies. I grasped at them, and found my arms like trunks of lead, unmoving. Warmth was rising in me, chasing out that pelagic cold, bleeding in from both my arms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bleeding.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was in a bed. Or else in something very like a bed, and someone was standing over me. I beheld old Tor Gibson, his gray eyes green in my delirium-green as his robes-his leonine mane and whiskers bristling in the wind off Meidua's waters.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Dead?" I croaked, unsure if I meant himself or me.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The old scholiast smiled. "Not yet. We might avoid that yet."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Lord Commandant, lie still please." That strange voice. Familiar. It came from Gibson's mouth, or so I thought. "You're still fugue-blind."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"No," I said, looking at the scholiast. "I can . . . can see Gibson."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"There's no one here but us!" The voice had moved, was opposite Gibson now, but the scholiast had not changed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>When Gibson spoke, his lips did not move. The actor knows he is on stage. The character knows there is no stage. It sounded like one of his scholiast's aphorisms, but I could not remember it.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was going mad. I was in a basement on Pharos-or was that years ago? She had been there with me, with Admiral Whent's thugs out after us, and we had come out alive. And Gibson was dead. And I'd been dead-or nearly so. Frozen.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Do you know where you are?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>A question, a question that spoke to the oldest exploratory and orienting circuits in the ancientmost corners of my brain. Do you know where you are?</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>As if the curtains on a stage were pulled back and the holography of the set pieces generated, the fog cleared and the real world took form. I was in medica. White walls, white floor, white ceiling. Too clean. I lay in the opened husk of a portable fugue cr che that someone had floated in here and bolted to the slab for revival. Turning, I saw that Gibson was gone. A hallucination? A vision brought on doubtless by the fact that there was still a part of me that thought in Gibson's voice.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Twelve years since Emesh.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It came back to me. "We're on the Pharaoh." We had acquired the ship on Pharos, had taken it after that business with the Normans and Admiral Whent, after Bordelon betrayed us. We had been hired-alongside Bordelon's company-to run weapons to freedom fighters attempting to overthrow the planetary dictator Marius Whent, all part of our efforts to build our credibility as a mercenary outfit as we hunted for Vorgossos. But Bordelon had betrayed us, and we had been forced to fight our way out. Marius Whent had been forced to surrender. Emil Bordelon had been killed, betrayed in his turn by his own soldiers-because I'd made them an offer they could not refuse.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The woman at my bedside, an ink-skinned Norman with hair like curling steel, nodded a judicious little nod. "Yes. And do you know who I am?" She wore a set of burgundy fatigues, form-fitting. A uniform. My uniform, I had designed it, with the flapped pockets and piped sleeves.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Doctor Okoyo," I said, an address and not an answer, "I don't think there was any cryoburn." I tried to sit up, at once aware as Adam of my nakedness.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Don't move, Lord Marlowe." She pushed me down, gentle but firm, and said, "I've not got all the TX9 out of you."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Turning, I saw the blood bags hanging from their staff beside me. AB Positive. Opposite was a drip pan emptying the anti-freezing agent from my veins. It shone cerulean in the too-white light; almost black. After a moment, I said, "You could have left me for a medtech, doctor."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okoyo snorted. "Commodore Lin would skin me if I did that, and you Imperial types actually skin people."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"You have a point," I conceded, "but you've nothing to fear from us, surely." We sat in silence a moment, the doctor busying herself with a diagnostic terminal while I pretended I was not naked and aware of it. I tried to sort the visions I had seen. Waking from fugue was never easy. The men who had abandoned me on Emesh had shoved just enough blood in me that they could not be accused of murder, and I had been unconscious for that ordeal, but on each occasion since, I had passed through a warren of memory and noise to the quiet of the world. The brain hyper-acted, so they said, on returning to consciousness. It was like dying, I thought, for in fugue the processes of my life were suspended as in formaldehyde, and that was as good as being dead. I was little different than a corpse, or a side of meat in a freezer.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I was wrong, of course. It is nothing like dying. Nothing at all.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"What's the standard date?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sixteen two-nineteen point one-one." She did not turn her head.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"November," I mused. Of the Year of our Empire 16219. Forty-eight years since Emesh, though I had lived but twelve of them. Forty-eight years pretending to be mercenaries. Forty-eight years free of Count Mataro and his designs on me for his daughter. Forty-eight years a special conscript of the Legions of the Sun.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Forty-eight more years of war. Of the abortive, genocidal crusade against the Cielcin, the xenobites who drank of human worlds and preyed upon our people like wolves among sheep. Forty-eight years hunting for Vorgossos, carrying Cielcin prisoners and the hope of parley. Of peace.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Is there some news?" I asked, sitting up now that the doctor could not stop me. My head swam, and I braced myself against the hard edges of my cr che. After a moment I stabilized, and tore a folded robe from the slab beside me. "Did we get a lead on that arms dealer the pirates gave us back on Sanora?" The doctor turned at the sound of my movement and hurried to my side. Her voice strained, she tried to lay me back down, but I held up a hand. "I'm just trying to cover myself."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Okoyo glowered. "You're just trying to make yourself pass out, Lord Marlowe."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's all right," I murmured, voice suddenly faint. "It's all right."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>She kept an arm around my shoulders, and it was all I could do to puddle the robe in my lap-but that was enough. My own breathing consumed my attention, thick and wet. Rolling, I bent over the drip pan and coughed up a glob of the violet suspension fluid that yet settled in my lungs. "You're not all right," Okoyo said. "You've been an ice cube for the last six years."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Six years?" I asked, surprised. I had not done the math. "Where are we?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The doctor shook her head. "Best leave that to the Commodore, Lord."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bassander Lin looked older than I remembered, and I wondered just how much of the intervening travel time the prickly captain had spent awake. I say captain, of course, because that was what he was. His role as Commodore was a mask, a persona, as much as was my position of Lord Commandant. The change in him was a subtle thing: no creasing about the eyes or mouth, no gray at the temples. But then, Lin was patrician, a bronze-skinned Mandari from an old family, his blood nearly so elevated as mine. The only real change lay within those black eyes of his. Something had hardened in them, the slow venom of our long association transmuted to amber; crystallized. His quarters aboard the Pharaoh had belonged to the Norman Commodore Emil Bordelon, and Bassander Lin had made some effort to remove all signs of the rooms' previous occupant. The pornographic artwork was all gone, the ornate frames discarded, the carpets removed. I could still see the fixtures in the floor where the Commodore's too-large bed had been, replaced by a simple soldier's cot. There were no blankets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Sleep well?" he asked, surveying me from behind his desk. "Okoyo gave you a clean bill of health." He had an annoying habit of answering his own questions. So I didn't speak, but slumped low in my chair, uncomfortable in my crimson uniform. Bassander was dressed identically, but on him the high collar and tokens of rank seemed to rest easy. I at least had no badges to wear, save the sigil I had made, picked out in gold thread on the left bicep. Bassander toyed with a heavy mug on his desk, not looking at me. "That woman Corvo thinks she's found our man."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I sat upright, leaning over the edge of the desk. Lin's flinty gaze tripped over my face, and he took a drink. "The Painted Man?" That was what the Sanoran pirates had called him.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The captain shook his head and stood, turning his back. "Some bastard called Samir. He works for The Painted Man, or so Corvo tells it." He was built like a rapier, rail-thin and slim-shouldered, and stood framed against a holograph plate depicting a collage of security feeds from inside the Pharaoh. "She sent one of her lieutenants down to the planet. He made contact."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We have Vorgossos, then?" I asked.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bassander did not move, save to toggle the feeds on his holograph plate, displaying other parts of his ship. "No." He put his hands on his hips, and I noticed the highmatter sword clipped there. It had belonged to Admiral Marius Whent, who had nearly cost us our lives during the Pharos affair. "Corvo's man says Samir's a local, just someone who covers for the Extrasolarian."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We need to set up a meeting . . ."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It seems that way." The captain shrugged, running hands through his wood-smoke hair. "Wouldn't be a problem if we had the 437th with us, but . . . with a band of misfits like ours . . . it's a joke." We could not have called for reinforcements in any case. They were thousands of light-years and decades of real time away.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Just because we're a front, Bassander," I said, biting off his name, "does not mean we're a joke."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Bassander Lin made a small dismissive noise in his throat and looked back at his screens. "We're outnumbered six to one by those Normans you picked up, as if your Colosso rats weren't bad enough."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>It took a long, steady breath to keep me from hurling his mug at him. I crossed my arms instead. "We needed reinforcements."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"We needed soldiers."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They are soldiers."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"They're foederati!" Bassander turned around at last. "They're loyal so long as we pay them. They'd turn on us in a moment if they saw a better offer."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Then we don't let them get a better offer." It was my turn then to snort derisively. "We're paying them half again as much as Bordelon was."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"That's not to say a higher bidder won't come along. I don't trust them. I don't trust Corvo. It's only working because the money is steady."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"Won't it stay that way?" I asked, putting my face in my hands. My head was pounding; I'd left medica far too soon. "The Empire. The Legions are backing us. Corvo knows that. The Meidua Red Company-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"The Meidua Red Company," Bassander sneered, shaking his head as he slung back into Commodore Bordelon's old chair. "Do you know what it is? For me?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I pressed my fingers against my eyes, tried to clear my head. "The tribune gave us a mission, to find the Cielcin, to try and-"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"It's a punishment post. She's saddled me with you and your misfits, Earth only knows why."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My eyes narrowed. "How long have you been awake?" He spoke like a man too long on his own, like he'd rehearsed this conversation with himself a thousand times in the naked corridors of the Pharaoh while the rest of us slept. Bassander seemed to take my point without answering it. He glowered, allowing me the opening to ask, "So you want me to head down to the surface? Find Samir? Find this Painted Man?"</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Commodore who was truly a captain frowned. "I just want you holding Corvo's leash. Like I said: I don't trust her."</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>"She's been with us now for seventeen standard years," I said. "I gave her command of the Mistral." At another look from Bassander I raised my hands, temporized, "We gave her command of the Mistral. She's good at her job." Before that, Otavia Corvo had been Emil Bordelon's third officer on the Pharaoh, and if the way she turned on her previous master was any indication, the man left much to be desired where commanding officers were concerned. Still, I couldn't say that I did not understand Bassander's trepidation. Unbidden, my eyes went to the front of the desk, where tangled relief carvings of nymphs and satyrs writhed in unprofessional ecstasy.</p></p><h2>Five on a Treasure Island (Famous Five)</h2><p>Classic editions of the timeless adventure stories where there&#39;s always a mystery to solve for Julian, Dick, Anne George and Timmy!</p><p>Enid Blyton's books have sold over 500 million copies and have been translated into other languages more often than any other children's author.<br><br>She wrote over 600 books and hundreds of short stories, including favourites such as<i>The Famous Five,</i><i>The Secret Seven</i>,<i>The Magic Faraway Tree</i>,<i>Malory Towers</i>and<i>Noddy</i>.<br><br>Born in London in 1897, Enid lived much of her life in Buckinghamshire and adored dogs, gardening and the countryside.

Exploring the most extreme manifestations of human zealotry, Lifton highlights an array of leaders&#x2014;from Mao to Hitler to the Japanese apocalyptic cult leader Sh&#x14d;k&#x14d; Asahara to Donald Trump&#x2014;who have sought the control of human minds and the ownership of reality.</p> <p>Lifton has spent decades exploring psychological extremism. His pioneering concept of the &#x201c;Eight Deadly Sins&#x201d; of ideological totalism&#x2014;originally devised to identify &#x201c;brainwashing&#x201d; (or &#x201c;thought reform&#x201d;) in political movements&#x2014;has been widely quoted in writings about cults, and embraced by members and former members of religious cults seeking to understand their experiences.</p> <p>In <em>Losing Reality</em> Lifton makes clear that the apocalyptic impulse&#x2014;that of destroying the world in order to remake it in purified form&#x2014;is not limited to religious groups but is prominent in extremist political movements such as Nazism and Chinese Communism, and also in groups surrounding Donald Trump. Lifton applies his concept of &#x201c;malignant normality&#x201d; to Trump&#x2019;s efforts to render his destructive falsehoods a routine part of American life. But Lifton sees the human species as capable of &#x201c;regaining reality&#x201d; by means of our &#x201c;protean&#x201d; psychological capacities and our ethical and political commitments as &#x201c;witnessing professionals.&#x201d;</p> <p>Lifton weaves together some of his finest work with extensive new commentary to provide vital understanding of our struggle with mental predators. <em>Losing Reality</em> is a book not only of stunning scholarship, but also of huge relevance for these troubled times.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p><strong>Robert Jay Lifton</strong> has written over twenty books, including many seminal works in the field such as the National Book Award&#x2013;winning <em>Death in Life: Survivors of Hiroshima</em> and <em>The Nazi Doctors</em>, as well as <em>The Climate Swerve</em> and <em>Losing Reality</em> (both from The New Press). He has taught at Yale University, Harvard University, and the City University of New York. He lives in New York City and Wellfleet, Massachusetts.</p><p><strong>Praise for <em>Losing Reality</em>:</strong><br>&#x201c;At the core of this work is the problem of the ownership of our mind, a problem thrown into relief at those historical moments when it is challenged&#x2014;by ideology, totalitarian politics, disinformation, cults, even social media. Psychiatrist and historian Robert Jay Lifton considers the psycho-politics of what he calls mental predation and how it can end up changing the way we see reality itself. Required reading for a necessary conversation.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Sherry Turkle, author of <em>Reclaiming Conversation: The Power of Talk in a Digital Age</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;In this distillation of a lifetime of scholarship and wisdom, Lifton delineates the psychology of fanaticism, from isolated cults to vast totalitarian systems. A treasure for our time.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Judith Herman, author of <em>Trauma and Recover</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;For decades, Robert Jay Lifton&#x2019;s work on the sources and dangers of inhuman zealotry&#x2014;brainwashers, mass murderers, religious extremists, political cultists&#x2014;has been a bulwark of democratic liberalism, a touchstone of public sanity. Now, with this selection of classic passages, in urgent combination with fresh reflections, Lifton has given us precisely what we need to understand, resist, and survive the unmoored chaos of the age of Trump. Lifton&#x2019;s writing, a long-established treasure, has never mattered more.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>James Carroll, author of <em>The Cloister</em></strong><br> <br> &#x201c;One of the world&#x2019;s foremost thinkers on why we humans do such awful things to each other.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;<strong>Bill Moyers</strong><br> </p></p><h2>The Day Jimmy&#39;s Boa Ate the Wash</h2><p>Jimmy&#39;s boa constrictor wreaks havoc on the class trip to a farm.</p><p>Steven Kellogg is a beloved author and illustrator who has published than 100 picture books, including the classics&nbsp;<i>The Mysterious Tadpole, Can I Keep Him?, The Island of the Skog, Is Your Mama a Llama?,</i>&nbsp;and this book,&nbsp;<i>Pinkerton, Behave!,</i>&nbsp;which was on&nbsp;<i>Horn Book</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Booklist&#x2019;s</i>&nbsp;Best of the Year lists and led to four sequels.

At stake are the quality of care for millions of Americans and the financial well-being of individuals and employers squeezed by skyrocketing premiums&#x2014;not to mention the stability of state and federal government budgets.<br><br>In Redefining Health Care, internationally renowned strategy expert Michael Porter and innovation expert Elizabeth Teisberg reveal the underlying&#x2014;and largely overlooked&#x2014;causes of the problem, and provide a powerful prescription for change.<br><br>The authors argue that competition currently takes place at the wrong level&#x2014;among health plans, networks, and hospitals&#x2014;rather than where it matters most, in the diagnosis, treatment, and prevention of specific health conditions. Participants in the system accumulate bargaining power and shift costs in a zero-sum competition, rather than creating value for patients. Based on an exhaustive study of the U.S. health care system, Redefining Health Care lays out a breakthrough framework for redefining the way competition in health care delivery takes place&#x2014;and unleashing stunning improvements in quality and efficiency.<br><br>With specific recommendations for hospitals, doctors, health plans, employers, and policy makers, this book shows how to move health care toward positive-sum competition that delivers lasting benefits for all.</p><p>Michael Porter acts as one of the World Economic Forum&#39;s Global Competitiveness Report&#39;s primary editors."...a profound and powerful critique of America&#x2019;s health-care system.

Many diverse factors have combined to weaken its structure in American society: the conflicting needs and schedules of dual working parents; the ongoing fragmentation of our civic, cultural, and religious communities; the prevalence of divorce and remarriage; the advent of technological distractions like video games and computers. What was once a strong, cohesive unit has become, in many cases, no more than a loose grouping of individuals with individual timetables and agendas. However, now more that ever before, we have the freedom to shape the kind of family we want, rather that an obligation to conform to inflexible concepts of what a family should be.<p>Nationally respected family therapist William J. Doherty believes that we can strengthen the ties that bind us together-and create new, more permanent ones in the process-through the use of family-specific everyday rituals. <em>The Intentional Family</em> -- a practical guide to avoiding conflicts and promoting understanding -- offers a myriad of simple yet effective methods for opening regular channels of communication between parents and their children, husbands and wives: from shared family meals and vacations, to regular "storytime," weekly drives, religious services, and monthly "spouse only" romantic dinners. Clearly presented and engagingly written, here are proven and indispensable strategies for reviving a lost sense of family -- useful guidelines that will help us make the most of our most important relationships.</p><p></p></p><p>William J.

Several years after his graduation from Yale Divinity School, he was selected by D. L. Moody to become the first dean of the Moody Bible Institute of Chicago. Under his direction, Moody Institute became a pattern for Bible institutes around the world. From 1903 to 1905, Dr. Torrey traveled the world in revival campaigns, winning thousands of souls to Jesus Christ. He continued worldwide crusades for the next fifteen years while he served as the dean of the Bible Institute of Los Angeles and pastored that city&#x2019;s Church of the Open Door. Dr. Torrey longed for more Christian workers to take an active part in bringing the message of salvation through Christ to a lost and dying world.

Lee: A Biography</h2><p><p><strong>"The best and most balanced of the Lee biographies."&#x2015;<em>New York Review of Books</em></strong></p> The life of Robert E. Lee is a story not of defeat but of triumph&#x2015;triumph in clearing his family name, triumph in marrying properly, triumph over the mighty Mississippi in his work as an engineer, and triumph over all other military men to become the towering figure who commanded the Confederate army in the American Civil War. But late in life Lee confessed that he "was always wanting something."<br><br> In this probing and personal biography, Emory Thomas reveals more than the man himself did. Robert E. Lee has been, and continues to be, a symbol and hero in the American story. But in life, Thomas writes, Lee was both more and less than his legend. Here is the man behind the legend. Photographs, drawings</p><p>Emory M. Thomas is Regent&#39;s Professor of History at the University of Georgia and author of a number of books on the Civil War. He lives in Athens, Georgia.Thomas positions this life of the Marble Man as a corrective to critical appraisals such as Alan Nolan's <i>Lee Reconsidered</i> (1991). Both authors must contend with Douglas Southall Freeman's enduring <i>R. E. Lee</i> (1934), so what a revealing delight are Thomas' newly mined nuggets that humanize the image of the imperturbable, heroic, saintly, and suffering Lee. Thomas extracts them from Lee's pre^-Civil War career, when he was mastering battlements (as an engineer) before mastering battles. Family life predominates, especially the legacy of Lee's famed father, "Light Horse" Harry Lee, Washington's cavalry chief, who landed in debtors prison. Thomas makes the case that that disgrace impelled the son on a lifelong, if subconscious, quest to repair by personal example the family name; hence Lee's legendary devotion to honor, duty, and courtesy. Perhaps his unspoken embarrassment was compounded by dependence on others for a living (his wealthy wife, the militaries, a college). The war narratives are professionally rendered (Thomas is many times an acclaimed Civil War author), but always in focus is the shy, conflict-avoiding Lee personality, excepting conflicts at the Seven Days and elsewhere, of course. Be Lee traitor or patriot, he is a compelling American figure. This fine work is an obligatory acquisition. <i>Gilbert Taylor</i></p><h2>The Peanuts Papers: Writers and Cartoonists on Charlie Brown, Snoopy &amp; the Gang, and the Meaning of Life: A Library of America Special Publication</h2><p><b>A one-of-a-kind celebration of America's greatest comic strip--and the life lessons it can teach us--from a stellar array of writers and artists</b><br><br>Over the span of fifty years, Charles M. Schulz created a comic strip that is one of the indisputable glories of American popular culture&#x2014;hilarious, poignant, inimitable. Some twenty years after the last strip appeared, the characters Schulz brought to life in <i>Peanuts </i>continue to resonate with millions of fans, their beguiling four-panel adventures and television escapades offering lessons about happiness, friendship, disappointment, childhood, and life itself.&nbsp;<br><br> In <i>The Peanuts Papers</i>, thirty-three writers and artists reflect on the deeper truths of Schulz&#x2019;s deceptively simple comic, its impact on their lives and art and on the broader culture. These enchanting, affecting, and often quite personal essays show just how much <i>Peanuts </i>means to its many admirers&#x2014;and the ways it invites us to ponder, in the words of Sarah Boxer, &#x201c;how to survive and still be a decent human being&#x201d; in an often bewildering world.

The adults told lies that didn&#x2019;t hold up. <em>Peanuts</em> told the truth: the popular kids aren&#x2019;t ever going to let you in; the kid you&#x2019;re in love with won&#x2019;t ever love you back; the most worthwhile people in life are the oddballs. I loved this book, which revealed to me the depth of my feelings for that comic strip - and also the vastness of its readership: millions of children reading the same four panels at the breakfast table, day after day. Reading this book was like finding a lost album of childhood photographs.&nbsp;It's an unexpected powerhouse of a book, and if <em>Peanuts</em> was part of your childhood, it will knock you out."&nbsp;<strong>--Caitlin Flanagan<br></strong><br>"Good grief! Who knew that a mere ( if admittedly great) comic strip, could inspire such great writing? Charles Schulz's unforgettable characters -- Charlie Brown, Lucy, Snoopy, Linus and Schroeder, among others -- have brought out profound personal musings and keen cultural insights in a group of talented writers, including Bruce Handy, Adam Gopnik and Ann Patchett. Anyone reading these essays will immediately be brought back to the 'emotional gore' of childhood, as Handy puts it, and to that yawning suburban landscape where Charlie Brown is always aspiring and always falling short, Lucy is always crabby, Snoopy is always dreaming up undog-like scenarios, Linus is an inveterate egghead on a par with Lionel Trilling, and Schroeder is channeling Beethoven. THE PEANUTS PAPERS is is an anthology unlike any other, to be treasured and earmarked. And for God's sake, keep it out of the rain."&nbsp;<strong>--Daphne&nbsp;Merkin </strong><br><br>&#x201c;If you could conjure some new secular Bible fashioned from popular culture, is there any doubt that <em>Peanuts</em> would be in it? Charles Schulz&#x2019;s beloved comic strip was shrewd but always down to earth, simple but sophisticated, generous but trenchant, and anchored in a handful of characters yet somehow universal. The product of a particular moment in time, <em>Peanuts</em> today lives timelessly outside it&#x2014;forever funny and humane. Now, in THE PEANUTS PAPERS, writers of every age and stripe bring their own memories and imaginations to this classic strip&#x2014;and in so doing so, show just how much they were inspired by it.&#x201d; <strong>&#x2014;Cullen Murphy, author of <em>Cartoon County: My Father and His Friends in the Golden Age of Make-Believe</em></strong></p></p><h2>From Doon with Death: The First Inspector Wexford Mystery</h2><p><b>Dazzling psychological suspense. Razor-sharp dialogue. Plots that catch and hold like a noose.

Except that Margaret Parsons is dead, brutally strangled, her body abandoned in the nearby woods. <br><br>Who would kill someone with nothing to hide? Inspector Wexford, the formidable chief of police, feels baffled -- until he discovers Margaret's dark secret: a trove of rare books, each volume breathlessly inscribed by a passionate lover identified only as Doon.

As Joe Ruffin set out to do his morning chores that Sunday, the sky was cloudless and blue. The temperature was in the high 70s&#x2014;normal for spring in east Georgia.</p><p>The sixty-year-old man started the day at his barn, rushing to feed his pigs, cows, and horses so he would not be late. He had sent his children ahead to the Carswell Grove Baptist Church in one of the family's two cars, a Buick Six. Ruffin would follow later. The church festival was to mark its fifty-second anniversary. Preachers from several counties were coming to deliver sermons. The choir would give a special performance. More than three thousand people would be on hand for a gala cookout of roast pig and fried chicken. Though Ruffin was not a Carswell Grove member, he had been asked to speak as a prominent black Mason and treasurer of another black church.</p><p>Ruffin had lived his entire life amid fields of cotton and sugar cane east of Millen, the seat of Jenkins County. The land he tilled was once part of the plantation where his parents worked as slaves. Ruffin remained on good terms with the Daniel family, the former slave owners. Ruffin owned almost 113 acres.1&nbsp;He ran five to seven plows a season&#x2014;a substantial operation for anyone in that part of Georgia at the time and a major accomplishment for a black farmer. Unlike many blacks in the area, he could read and write, though census records did not report him having any formal education.2</p><p>Many of the years had been tough. Several times Ruffin had to mortgage tracts of land. He even took out loans on his mules and horses to cover debts.3</p><p>He had a large family. The 1910 census recorded three sons and four daughters living with him, plus another son and his family down the road. Ruffin was a widower.</p><p>Two sons&#x2014;John Holiday, twenty-six, and Henry, thirteen&#x2014;lived at home. Louis Ruffin, in his late twenties, farmed nearby.4&nbsp;A fourth son, Joe Andrew Ruffin, twenty-four, served with the U.S. Army in France. He was due home in time for the fall harvest.</p><p>Whatever Ruffin's past struggles, 1919 was shaping up to be profitable. Cotton was fetching extraordinary prices, averaging more than 35 cents per pound, the highest ever.5&nbsp;The Great War, which the United States entered in April 1917, was a boon for cotton. Textile mills needed tons of it for uniforms and other goods. The war's end the previous November had opened a broader market for cotton; mills across the world needed it for civilian clothes. Supply was limited as the ineluctable spread of the boll weevil reduced production in many parts of the South, including Georgia. Higher prices, fueled in part by cotton scarcity, helped farmers. The previous month, Congress boosted the price of cotton further by passing an amendment to the federal Cotton Futures Act, making it easier for speculators to make bids.6&nbsp;As global demand for cotton increased, futures skyrocketed. This spike was a windfall for Ruffin and millions of other southern farmers from Virginia to Texas.</p><p>Jenkins County, Georgia, lay in the lower third of a swath of cotton farmland that extended from eastern Virginia into southern Alabama. From colonial days, the region had evolved into a network of plantations, cotton storehouses, and small towns grouped along a major road that later supported a railroad running south from Augusta to the Atlantic port of Savannah. Jenkins was rural and poor, like most counties in the region. Blacks accounted for almost two-thirds of its population.7&nbsp;Many blacks in the county were illiterate, and election records indicate that only a handful were allowed to vote. All county government officials, from commissioners to police, were white.</p><p>Most blacks in Jenkins County were sharecroppers renting land from white landlords, but a growing number owned property, a phenomenon occurring all over the South. In the first decades of the twentieth century, despite the legal barriers imposed by Jim Crow, the number of acres owned by black farmers rose. In Georgia, black ownership jumped by 75 percent from 1899 to 1919.8&nbsp;These landowners formed the "respectable" classes of black society in southern towns. They sat on church boards and led social groups. They generally had good relations with white business owners and politicians, serving as go-betweens when racial friction erupted. In the late morning of this particular April Sunday, Joe Ruffin was the embodiment of this new class, having spent a lifetime navigating the racial restrictions of southern life. Through luck and hard work, he had prospered and never gave "offense to any white man in the county."9</p><p>By the late afternoon of that April 13, however, almost every white man in Jenkins County wanted Joe Ruffin dead.</p><p>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*</p><p>Around 11:30 a.m., Ruffin's youngest son, Henry, came back to the farm to get his father.10&nbsp;Masons at the festival had asked for him.11&nbsp;Ruffin changed into his best Sunday clothes, then got in his second car&#x2014;a late-model, high-powered Ford touring car&#x2014;and headed down the road. Henry stayed at the farm. The 15-mile drive from Ruffin's farm near Billies Branch to the church was cut with swampy creeks and hollows.12&nbsp;The roads were unpaved. The car drove past acre upon acre of young cotton plants, very low to the ground with thin waxy leaves. Jenkins County is in the middle part of the state near the Savannah River Valley, where Georgia's Piedmont slopes gradually toward the coast. Georgia's famous red clay is sandier in this part of the state and a paler shade of orange. Ruffin could see cultivated land for miles, broken up by copses of loblolly pine and scrub oak as well as thickets of holly and cypress. Hawks and buzzards circled the sky.</p><p>Sometime after 2 p.m., Ruffin reached Big Buckhead Church Road, the final road leading to the festival. The dirt road had been around since the earliest settlers cut through the forest. As he crossed Buckhead Creek Bridge, Big Buckhead Church&#x2014;one of the oldest inland white congregations in the South&#x2014;was on his left. Across the road, mossy obelisk grave markers of Confederate veterans stood in a small cemetery.13&nbsp;In the closing days of the Civil War, when Ruffin was a young boy, Union and Confederate cavalry battled here.14&nbsp;The rebels lost; hundreds were killed.15</p><p>Carswell Grove was founded two and a half years after the battle in the midst of the social turmoil caused by the Confederacy's collapse. After the war, whites at Big Buckhead Church kicked out blacks, who for generations had sat in segregated pews. Porter W. Carswell, a white judge who owned nearby Bellevue Plantation, gave black congregants two acres of scrubland to erect their own place of worship just down the road. The congregants named their new church in his honor. By 1919, Carswell Grove Baptist Church boasted more than a thousand members, most of them sharecroppers. The yearly celebration of the church's founding was one of the largest African American gatherings in east Georgia.</p><p>As Ruffin drove up the low ridge, he saw throngs of black men, women, and children milling about the grounds. They were talking and laughing&#x2014;it was the cacophony of a large, joyous group. Ruffin parked his car and joined them. After a short time, Ruffin remembered that he had left the door to his house unlocked and decided to drive home. He got in his car, but the swelling crowds blocked the road. He drove as far as he could, almost to Big Buckhead Church, when he was forced to stop and wait for people to move along.</p><p>As he sat there, an older Ford drove up behind him and then pulled alongside. People scrambled off the road to get out of the car's way. It stopped abruptly and Ruffin looked over at its occupants: two white lawmen and a distraught black man in handcuffs. Ruffin knew the black man: Edmund Scott, his longtime friend.16&nbsp;The driver was W. Clifford Brown, a Jenkins County police officer. In the back of the car with Scott sat Thomas Stephens, a Millen police night marshal. When he saw Ruffin, Scott frantically shouted to the white officers, "I can get him to stand my bond."17</p><p>Why the two white officers were at the black gathering is unclear. They had no warrant. Marshal Stephens was not even in his jurisdiction. In all likelihood, they were in search of illegal alcohol. Brown and Stephens were known for going after stills and liquor joints known in many parts of the South as "blind tigers."18&nbsp;That spring, the National Prohibition Act was making its way through Congress. It would enforce the Eighteenth Amendment, which banned the sale of liquor nationwide. But in Georgia, the ongoing murky contest between police and those who made, sold, and drank liquor was an old game. In 1907, the Georgia legislature, bowing to pressure from Baptists, passed a law banning alcohol.19&nbsp;The law was enacted partly in response to the Atlanta race riot of 1906, when white mobs attacked blacks for three days. Twenty-five blacks and one white were killed. White opponents of alcohol argued that heavy drinking in downtown saloons had been a catalyst for trouble, which they blamed primarily on blacks. The law, however, did little to suppress Georgia's thirst. By 1919, a thriving underground network of alcohol manufacturers and distributors operated across the state. The police, who were always white, played a running game of cat-and-mouse with still operators, many of whom were black. Sometimes police destroyed confiscated booze. Sometimes corrupt officers resold it. One newspaper reported that Brown, in only three months on the force, filed more than a hundred cases against gamblers and liquor manufacturers. The same report said Brown suspected Scott and the Ruffins of running a still.20</p><p>L. W. Beach, a white superintendent over black sharecroppers at a nearby plantation, told a different story.

In 2010 they were nominated for the Bologna Ragazzi Award and have since been nominated for the IBBY Honor List (2010).So, a couple years ago I predicted that my kids would still be flipping through the book Maps by Aleksandra Mizielinska and Daniel Mizielinski-and I was right. The pages are well-loved, and it&#39;s still displayed prominently on our coffee table. So recently we&#39;ve added the MAPS Activity Book to our collection, and my kids are equally entertained by this coloring and activity book that lets them get creative about geography and world cultures. This oversized coloring book has tear-out pages about the size of a place mat. And that&#39;s one way I use it-keeping the kids busy while I cook dinner. Or unpack the take-out boxes. They can color animals from around the world, identify the continents on a world map, design your own kimono, or create intricate patterns on Mexican sugar skulls. It&#39;s a really nice mix of geography and culture in one book. I think the reason my kids have kept returning to the MAPS Activity Book over, say, their Dora coloring books, is because it allows so much freedom to be creative. You&#39;re not just filling in the colors on countries&#39; flags; you have a place to design your own flag too. And when your life&#39;s dream is to be the ruler of the world - which my kids are practicing hard for, and I&#39;m sure they&#39;re not alone - then naming your own country and designing its flag is a great place to start. -- Kate Etue * Cool Mom Picks * Using the same principles and in the same series, Aleksandra Mizielinska and Daniel Mizielinski&#39;s Maps Activity Book is a little more difficult but equally rewarding.

We go to synagogue dutifully enough. We rise when we should rise, sit when we should sit. We read and sing along with the cantor and answer 'Amen' in all the right places. We may even rattle through the prayers with ease. We sacrifice vitality for shelf-life, and the <em>neshomeh</em>, the Jewish soul, can taste the difference."<br>&#x2015;from the Introduction</p></blockquote><p>This fresh approach to prayer is for all who wish to appreciate the power of prayer's poetry and song, jump into its ceremonies and rituals, and join the age-old conversation that Jews have had with God. Reb Zalman, one of the most important Jewish spiritual teachers in contemporary American Judaism, offers you new ways to pray, new channels for communicating with God and new opportunities to open your heart to God&#x2019;s response.</p><p>With rare warmth and authenticity, Reb Zalman shows you:</p><ul><li>How prayer can engage not just spirit, but mind, heart and body</li><li>Meditations that open the door to <em>kavanah</em>, the focus or intention with which we pray</li><li>How to understand the underlying "deep structure" of our prayer services</li><li>How to find and feel at home in a synagogue</li><li>How to sing and lead <em>niggunim</em>, the simple, wordless tunes that Jews sing to get closer to God</li><li>and more</li></ul><p></p></p><p><p><b>Rabbi Zalman M. Schachter-Shalomi</b><strong> (<em>z"l</em>)</strong>, the inspiration of the Jewish Renewal movement, is widely recognized as one of the most important Jewish spiritual teachers of our time. Professor at Temple University, he authored many books including <i>Davening: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Prayer</i>, winner of the National Jewish Book Award; <i>First Steps to a New Jewish Spirit: Reb Zalman's Guide to Recapturing the Intimacy &amp; Ecstasy in Your Relationship with God</i> (both Jewish Lights); <i>From Age-ing to Sage-ing</i> and <i>Wrapped in a Holy Flame</i>.</p><br><br><p><strong>Joel Segel</strong>, editor of many books on spirituality, is coauthor (with Reb Zalman) of <em>Jewish with Feeling: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Practice</em> and <em>Davening: A Guide to Meaningful Jewish Prayer.</em></p><br><br><p><strong>Lawrence Kushner</strong>, author, lecturer and spiritual leader, is regarded as one of the most creative religious thinkers and writers in America. A commentator on National Public Radio's <em>All Things Considered,</em> he has focused us on spiritual renewal with wisdom and humor. Through his books and lectures, people of every faith and background have found inspiration and new strength for spiritual search and growth. It has been said that some spiritual leaders blend religion and psychology to help us walk better on the ground, but Lawrence Kushner draws on the wisdom of the mystics to help us dance better on the ceiling.</p><p>Kushner's acclaimed books include <em>I&#x2019;m God; You&#x2019;re Not: Observations on Organized Religion &amp; Other Disguises of the Ego</em>; <em>Honey from the Rock: An Easy Introduction to Jewish Mysticism</em>;<em> Invisible Lines of Connection: Sacred Stories of the Ordinary</em>;<em> The Book of Letters: A Mystical Hebrew Alphabet</em>;<em> Jewish Spirituality: A Brief Introduction for Christians</em>;<em> </em>and<em> In God&#x2019;s Hands</em>, an inspiring fable for children, with Gary Schmidt (all Jewish Lights).</p><p>Kushner served as rabbi at Congregation Beth El in Sudbury, Massachusetts, for almost thirty years; he is currently the Emanu-El scholar at Congregation Emanu-El in San Francisco, and an adjunct faculty member at Hebrew Union College&#x2013;Jewish Institute of Religion. He is fascinated by graphic design and computers (designing most of his Jewish Lights books). He enjoys Mozart, hanging around sailboats, and making his granddaughters giggle.</p><p>This book is about "Davening," the Yiddish word for prayer.</p><p>Even people who insist that prayer is an intellectual process rather than an emotional, spiritual and religious experience, as demonstrated by Rabbi Zalman Schacter-Shalomi in this book, will enjoy reading his book. Also, even non-Jews will enjoy and benefit from the rabbi's views. Why?</p><p>First, the book is a delight to read. The rabbi tells stories on virtually every page, about himself, Chabad Chasidim and clever and thought provoking parables. Among many other things, the rabbi tells about <em>kavanah</em>, praying with focus, intention and meaning. He shows how to pray from the heart, rather than from the mind. Celebrating the Sabbath or holiday with <em>kavanah</em>, for example, gives the day a richer meaning.</p><p>He speaks also about the <em>niggun</em>, the melody, the wordless prayer, tunes Hasidim sing to get closer to God. Some have words and some do not. He tells how he used a <em>niggun</em> to get in the mood for prayer and how once he came so close to God by singing a <em>niggun</em> that he felt no need to continue with the formal prayers.</p><p>He tells about the mystical notion of God and how prayer fits into this notion. He gives readers "a traveler's guide" through the prayers, during which he describes many prayers and shows readers their inner meaning. He also tells how people can feel "at home in Shul," what they should do to feel what they are experiencing and how to get the most out of the experience.</p> (Israel Drazin <i>The Jewish Eye</i>)</p><h2>The Jezebel Spirit (Discernment Series)</h2><p>This is a concentrated study on discerning, warring against, defeating and deliverance from the Jezebel spirit.

These delectable and collectible Penguin editions are bound in high-quality colourful, tactile cloth with foil stamped into the design Mark Twain&#39;s tale of a boy&#39;s picaresque journey down the Mississippi on a raft conveyed the voice and experience of the American frontier as no other work had done before. When Huck escapes from his drunken father and the &#39;sivilizing&#39; Widow Douglas with the runaway slave Jim, he embarks on a series of adventures that draw him to feuding families and the trickery of the unscrupulous &#39;Duke&#39; and &#39;Dauphin&#39;. Beneath the exploits, however, are more serious undercurrents - of slavery, adult control and, above all, of Huck&#39;s struggle between his instinctive goodness and the corrupt values of society, which threaten his deep and enduring friendship with Jim. Mark Twain was born Samuel Langhorne Clemens on 30th November 1835, in Florida, Missouri. In 1853 he left home, earning a living as an itinerant type-setter, and four years later became an apprentice pilot on the Mississippi, a career cut short by the outbreak of the Civil War. For five years, as a prospector and a journalist, Clemens lived in Nevada and California. In February 1863 he first used the pseudonym &#39;Mark Twain&#39; as the signature to a humorous travel letter. A trip to Europe and the Holy Land in 1867 became the basis of his first major book, The Innocents Abroad (1869). His numerous subsequent books include The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876), A Tramp Aborad (1880), The Prince and the Pauper (1882), and his masterpiece, The Adventures of Huckleberry Fin (1885). Twain died on 21st April 1910. &#39;The best book we&#39;ve had&#39; - Ernest Hemingway</p><p>A seminal work of American Literature that still commands deep praise and still elicits controversy, <i>Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</i> is essential to the understanding of the American soul. The recent discovery of the first half of Twain's manuscript, long thought lost, made front-page news. And this unprecedented edition, which contains for the first time omitted episodes and other variations present in the first half of the handwritten manuscript, as well as facsimile reproductions of thirty manuscript pages, is indispensable to a full understanding of the novel. The changes, deletions, and additions made in the first half of the manuscript indicate that Mark Twain frequently checked his impulse to write an even darker, more confrontational book than the one he finally published.Cambridge Literature is a series of literary texts edited for study by students aged 14-18 in English-speaking classrooms.

One look prompts LAPD detective Milo Sturgis to summon his expert in homicidal maniacs, Alex Delaware. But even Alex is stymied when more slayings occur in the same ghastly fashion&#x2014;with no apparent connection among the victims. And the only clue left behind&#x2014;a blank page bearing a question mark&#x2014;seems to be both a menacing taunt and a chilling cry for help from a tortured, savage soul. To end the bloody spree and prevent citywide panic, Alex navigates the secretive world of mental health treatment, from the sleek office of a Beverly Hills therapist to a shuttered mental institution where he once learned his craft. As each jagged piece of the puzzle fits into place, a portrait emerges of a sinister mind at its most unimaginable&#x2014;and an evil soul at its most unspeakable.<br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;Expertly crafted, judiciously paced and echoing with larger social concerns.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Star-Ledger</i></b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> <b>&#x201c;The combination of Alex Delaware [and] Detective Milo Sturgis . . . makes for the most original whodunit duo since Watson and Holmes.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Forbes<br></i></b><br>Don&#x2019;t miss the excerpt of Jonathan Kellerman&#x2019;s <i>Guilt</i> in the back of the book.</p><p><b>Jonathan Kellerman</b> is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author of more than thirty bestselling crime novels, including the Alex Delaware series, <i>The Butcher&#x2019;s Theater, Billy Straight, The Conspiracy Club,</i> <i>Twisted, </i>and<i> True Detectives</i>.

Here's the address.<br><br>An hour later, I was showing I.D. to the uniform guarding the tape. He winced. "Up there, Doctor." Pointing to the second story of a sky-blue duplex trimmed in chocolate-brown, he dropped a hand to his Sam Browne belt, as if ready for self-defense.<br><br>Nice older building, the classic Cal-Spanish architecture, but the color was wrong. So was the silence of the street, sawhorsed at both ends. Three squad cars and a liver-colored LTD were parked haphazardly across the asphalt. No crime lab vans or coroner's vehicles had arrived, yet.<br><br>I said, "Bad?"<br><br>The uniform said, "There's probably a better word for it but that works."<br><br>u<br><br>Milo stood on the landing outside the door doing nothing.<br><br>No cigar-smoking or jotting in his pad or grumbling orders. Feet planted, arms at his sides, he stared at some faraway galaxy.<br><br>His blue nylon windbreaker bounced sunlight at strange angles. His black hair was limp, his pitted face the color and texture of cottage cheese past its prime. A white shirt had wrinkled to crepe. Wheat- colored cords had slipped beneath his paunch. His tie was a sad shred of poly.<br><br>He looked as if he'd dressed wearing a blindfold.<br><br>As I climbed the stairs, he didn't acknowledge me.<br><br>When I was six steps away, he said, "You made good time."<br><br>"Easy traffic."<br><br>"Sorry," he said.<br><br>"For what?"<br><br>"Including you." He handed me gloves and paper booties.<br><br>I held the door for him. He stayed outside.<br><br>The woman was at the rear of the apartment's front room, flat on her back. The kitchen behind her was empty, counters bare, an old avocado- colored fridge free of photos or magnets or mementos.<br><br>Two doors to the left were shut and yellow-taped. I took that as a Keep Out. Drapes were drawn over every window. Fluorescent lighting in the kitchen supplied a nasty pseudo-dawn.<br><br>The woman's head was twisted sharply to the right. A swollen tongue hung between slack, bloated lips.<br><br>Limp neck. A grotesque position some coroner might label "incompatible with life."<br><br>Big woman, broad at the shoulders and the hips. Late fifties to early sixties, with an aggressive chin and short, coarse gray hair. Brown sweatpants covered her below the waist. Her feet were bare. Unpolished toenails were clipped short. Grubby soles said bare feet at home was the default.<br><br>Above the waistband of the sweats was what remained of a bare torso. Her abdomen had been sliced horizontally below the navel in a crude approximation of a C-section. A vertical slit crossed the lateral incision at the center, creating a star-shaped wound.<br><br>The damage brought to mind one of those hard-rubber change purses that relies on surface tension to protect the goodies. Squeeze to create a stellate opening, then reach in and scoop.<br><br>The yield from this receptacle was a necklace of intestines placed below the woman's neckline and arranged like a fashionista's puffy scarf. One end terminated at her right clavicle. Bilious streaks ran down her right breast and onto her rib cage. The rest of her viscera had been pulled down into a heap and left near her left hip.<br><br>The pile rested atop a once-white towel folded double. Below that was a larger maroon towel spread neatly. Four other expanses of terry cloth formed a makeshift tarp that shielded beige wall-to-wall carpeting from biochemical insult. The towels had been arranged precisely, edges overlapping evenly for about an inch. Near the woman's right hip was a pale blue T shirt, also folded. Spotless.<br><br>Doubling the white towel had succeeded in soaking up a good deal of body fluid, but some had leaked into the maroon under-layer. The smell would've been bad enough without the initial stages of decomp.<br><br>One of the towels beneath the body bore lettering. Silver bath sheet embroidered Vita in white.<br><br>Latin or Italian for "life." Some monster's notion of irony?<br><br>The intestines were green-brown splotched pink in spots, black in others. Matte finish to the casing, some puckering that said they'd been drying for a while. The apartment was cool, a good ten degrees below the pleasant spring weather outside. The rattle of a wheezy A.C. unit in one of the living room windows was inescapable once I noticed it. Noisy apparatus, rusty at the bolts, but efficient enough to leach moisture from the air and slow down the rot.<br><br>But rot is inevitable and the woman's color wasn't anything you'd see outside a morgue.<br><br>Incompatible with life.<br><br>I bent to inspect the wounds. Both slashes were confident swoops unmarred by obvious hesitation marks, shearing smoothly through layers of skin, subcutaneous fat, diaphragmatic muscle.<br><br>No abrasions around the genital area and surprisingly little blood for so much brutality. No spatter or spurt or castoff or evidence of a struggle. All those towels; horribly compulsive.<br><br>Guesses filled my head with bad pictures.<br><br>Extremely sharp blade, probably not serrated. The neck-twist had killed her quickly and she'd been dead during the surgery, the ultimate anesthesia. The killer had stalked her with enough thoroughness to know he'd have her to himself for a while. Once attaining total control, he'd gone about choreographing: laying out the towels, tucking and aligning, achieving a pleasing symmetry. Then he'd laid her down, removed her T shirt, careful to keep it clean.<br><br>Standing back, he'd inspected his prep work. Time for the blade.<br><br>Then the real fun: anatomical exploration.<br><br>Despite the butchery and the hideous set of her neck, she looked peaceful. For some reason, that made what had been done to her worse.<br><br>I scanned the rest of the room. No damage to the front door or any other sign of forced entry. Bare beige walls backed cheap upholstered furniture covered in a puckered ocher fabric that aped brocade but fell short. White ceramic beehive lamps looked as if they'd shatter under a finger-snap.<br><br>The dining area was set up with a card table and two folding chairs. A brown cardboard take-out pizza box sat on the table. Someone-probably Milo-had placed a yellow plastic evidence marker nearby. That made me take a closer look.<br><br>No brand name on the box, just PIZZA! in exuberant red cursive above the caricature of a portly mustachioed chef. Curls of smaller lettering swarmed around the chef's fleshy grin.<br><br>Fresh pizza!<br><br>Lotta taste!<br><br>Ooh la la!<br><br>Yum yum!<br><br>Bon app�tit!<br><br>The box was pristine, not a speck of grease or finger-smudge. I bent down to sniff, picked up no pizza aroma. But the decomp had filled my nose; it would be a while before I'd be smelling anything but death.<br><br>If this was another type of crime scene, some detective might be making ghoulish jokes about free lunch.<br><br>The detective in charge of this scene was a lieutenant who'd seen hundreds of murders, maybe thousands, yet chose to stay outside for a while.<br><br>I let loose more mental pictures. Some fiend in a geeky delivery hat ringing the doorbell then managing to talk himself inside.<br><br>Watching as the prey went for her purse? Waiting for precisely the right moment before coming up behind her and clamping both his hands on the sides of her head.<br><br>Quick blitz of rotation. The spinal cord would separate and that would be it.<br><br>Doing it correctly required strength and confidence.<br><br>That and the lack of obvious transfer evidence-not even a shoe impression-screamed experience. If there'd been a similar murder in L.A., I hadn't heard about it.<br><br>Despite all that meticulousness, the hair around the woman's temples might be a good place to look for transfer DNA. Psychopaths don't sweat much, but you never know.<br><br>I examined the room again.<br><br>Speaking of purses, hers was nowhere in sight.<br><br>Robbery as an afterthought? More likely souvenir-taking was part of the plan.<br><br>Edging away from the body, I wondered if the woman's last thoughts had been of crusty dough, mozzarella, a comfy barefoot dinner.<br><br>The doorbell ring the last music she'd ever hear.<br><br>I stayed in the apartment awhile longer, straining for insight.<br><br>The terrible competence of the neck-twist made me wonder about someone with martial arts training.<br><br>The embroidered towel bothered me.<br><br>Vita. Life.<br><br>Had he brought that one but taken the rest from her linen closet?<br><br>Yum. Bon app�tit. To life.<br><br>The decomp reek intensified and my eyes watered and blurred and the necklace of guts morphed into a snake.<br><br>Drab constrictor, fat and languid after a big meal.<br><br>I could stand around and pretend that this was anything comprehensible, or hurry outside and try to suppress the tide of nausea rising in my own guts.<br><br>Not a tough choice.<br><br>CHAPTER<br><br>2<br><br>M<br><br>ilo hadn't moved from his position on the landing. His eyes were back on Planet Earth, watching the street below. Five uniforms were moving from door to door. From the quick pace of the canvass, plenty of no- one-home.<br><br>The street was in a working-class neighborhood in the southeastern corner of West L.A. Division. Three blocks east would've made it someone else's problem. Mixed zoning allowed single-family dwellings and duplexes like the one where the woman had been degraded.<br><br>Psychopaths are stodgy creatures of routine and I wondered if the killer's comfort zone was so narrow that he lived within the sawhorses.<br><br>I caught my breath and worked at settling my stomach while Milo pretended not to notice.<br><br>"Yeah, I know," he finally said. He was apologizing for the second time when a coroner's van drove up and a dark-haired woman in comfortable clothes got out and hurried up the stairs. "Morning, Milo."<br><br>"Morning, Gloria. All yours."<br><br>"Oh, boy," she said. "We talking freaky-bad?"<br><br>"I could say I've seen worse, kid, but I'd be lying."<br><br>"Coming from you that gives me the creeps, Milo."<br><br>"Because I'm old?"<br><br>"Tsk." She patted his shoulder. "Because you're the voice of experience."<br><br>"Some experiences I can do without."<br><br>People can get used to just about anything. But if your psyche's in good repair, the fix is often temporary.<br><br>Soon after receiving my doctorate, I worked as a psychologist on a pediatric cancer ward. It took a month to stop dreaming about sick kids but I was eventually able to do my job with apparent professionalism. Then I left to go into private practice and found myself, years later, on that same ward. Seeing the children with new eyes mocked all the adaptation I thought I'd accomplished and made me want to cry. I went home and dreamed for a long time.<br><br>Homicide detectives get "used" to a regular diet of soul-obliteration. Typically bright and sensitive, they soldier on, but the essence of the job lurks beneath the surface like a land mine. Some D's transfer out. Others stay and find hobbies. Religion works for some, sin for others. Some, like Milo, turn griping into an art form and never pretend it's just another job.<br><br>The woman on the towels was different for him and for me. A permanent image bank had lodged in my brain and I knew the same went for him.<br><br>Neither of us talked as Gloria worked inside.<br><br>Finally, I said, "You marked the pizza box. It bothers you."<br><br>"Everything about this bothers me."<br><br>"No brand name on the box. Any indies around here deliver?"<br><br>He drew out his cell phone, clicked, and produced a page. Phone numbers he'd already downloaded filled the screen and when he scrolled, the listings kept coming.<br><br>"Twenty-eight indies in a ten-mile radius and I also checked Domino's and Papa John's and Two Guys. No one dispatched anyone to this address last night and nobody uses that particular box."<br><br>"If she didn't actually call out, why would she let him in?"<br><br>"Good question."<br><br>"Who discovered her?"<br><br>"Landlord, responding to a complaint she made a few days ago. Hissing toilet, they had an appointment. When she didn't answer, he got annoyed, started to leave. Then he thought better of it because she liked things fixed, used his key."<br><br>"Where is he now?"<br><br>He pointed across the street. "Recuperating with some firewater down in that little Tudor-ish place."<br><br>I found the house. Greenest lawn on the block, beds of flowers. Topiary bushes.<br><br>"Anything about him bother you?"<br><br>"Not so far. Why?"<br><br>"His landscaping says he's a perfectionist."<br><br>"That's a negative?"<br><br>"This case, maybe."<br><br>"Well," he said, "so far he's just the landlord. Want to know about her?"<br><br>"Sure."<br><br>"Her name's Vita Berlin, she's fifty-six, single, lives on some kind of disability."<br><br>"Vita," I said. "The towel was hers."<br><br>"The towel? This bastard used every damn towel she had in her linen closet."<br><br>"Vita means 'life' in Latin and Italian. I thought it might be a sick joke."<br><br>"Cute. Anyway, I'm waiting for Mr. Belleveaux-the landlord-to calm down so I can question him and find out more about her. What I've learned from prelim snooping in her bedroom and bathroom is if she's got kids she doesn't keep their pictures around and if she had a computer, it was ripped off. Same for a cell phone. My guess is she had neither, the place has a static feel to it. Like she moved in years ago, didn't add any newfangled stuff."<br><br>"I didn't see her purse."<br><br>"On her nightstand."<br><br>"You taped off the bedroom, didn't want me in there?"<br><br>"I sure do, but that'll wait until the techies are through. Can't afford to jeopardize any aspect of this."<br><br>"The front room was okay?"<br><br>"I knew you'd be careful."<br><br>His logic seemed strained. Insufficient sleep and a bad surprise can do that.<br><br>I said, "Any indication she was heading to the bedroom before he jumped her?"<br><br>"No, it's pristine. Why?"<br><br>I gave him the delivery tip scenario.<br><br>"Going for her purse," he said. "Well, I don't know how you'd prove that, Alex. Main thing is he confined himself to the front, didn't move her into the bedroom for anything sexual."<br><br>I said, "Those towels make me think of a stage. Or a picture frame."<br><br>"Meaning?"<br><br>"Showing off his work."<br><br>"Okay . . . what else to tell you . . . her wardrobe's mostly sweats and sneakers, lots of books in her bedroom. Romances and the kinds of mysteries where people talk like No�l Coward twits and the cops are bumbling cretins."<br><br>I wondered out loud about a killer with martial arts skills and when he didn't respond, went on to describe the kill-scene still bouncing around my brain.<br><br>He said, "Sure, why not."<br><br>Agreeable but distracted. Neither of us focusing on the big question.<br><br>Why would anyone do something like this to another human being?<br><br>Gloria exited the apartment, looking older and paler.<br><br>Milo said, "You okay?"<br><br>"I'm fine," she said. "No, I'm lying, that was horrible." Her forehead was moist. She dabbed it with a tissue. "My God, it's grotesque."<br><br>"Any off-the-cuff impressions?"<br><br>"Nothing you probably haven't figured out yourself. Broken neck's my bet for COD, the cutting looks postmortem. The incisions look clean so maybe some training in meat-cutting or a paramedical field but I wouldn't put much stock in that, all kinds of folk can learn to slice. That pizza box mean something to you?"</p><h2>Spiral Dynamics: Mastering Values, Leadership and Change</h2><p><i>Spiral Dynamics</i> introduces a new model for plotting the enormous economic and commercial shifts that are making contemporary business practice so complex and apparently fragmented.

The author of the bestselling (not to mention heartbreaking) novel, <em>The Boy in the Striped Pajamas</em>, has crafted a story that has all the feels &#x2013; it&#x2019;s genuinely funny, romantically tragic, with moments of sickening violence and then just as quickly redemptive resilience. Set in Post-War Ireland, when intolerance cloaked in Catholicism is at its height, we follow the lifespan of the adopted boy Cyril Avery. On the first page, Cyril introduces us to his birth mother and the circumstances in which he was born, and for the rest of the book, the reader is in Boyne&#x2019;s capable hands: waiting, wondering, clamoring to know when he will meet his birth mother and how it will be uncovered that they are related. Told in seven year increments, taking the reader from Dublin to Amsterdam to New York and back, we bear witness to Cyril&#x2019;s life alongside the cultural and societal evolution of Ireland. Weaving in and out of chance encounters with his birth mother, love affairs, decades-long friendships and bitter wounds from the past, Boyne has paced this novel perfectly, providing the reader one of the greatest gifts that fiction can deliver: hope. <em>--Al Woodworth </em>John Boyne was born in Ireland in 1971. He is the author of eleven novels for adults, five for young readers and a collection of short stories. Perhaps best known for his 2006 multi-award-winning book The Boy In The Striped Pyjamas, John's other novels, notably The Absolutist and A History of Loneliness, have been widely praised and are international bestsellers. Most recently, The Heart's Invisible Furies was a Richard &amp; Judy Bookclub word-of-mouth bestseller.

But let&#x2019;s be honest: hedging has never inspired anyone.<br> <br> So what if we stopped hedging? What if we grounded our efforts to solve environmental problems in hope instead, and let nature make our case for us? That&#x2019;s what George Monbiot does in <i>Feral</i>, a lyrical, unabashedly romantic vision of how, by inviting nature back into our lives, we can simultaneously cure our &#x201c;ecological boredom&#x201d; and begin repairing centuries of environmental damage. Monbiot takes readers on an enchanting journey around the world to explore ecosystems that have been &#x201c;rewilded&#x201d;: freed from human intervention and allowed&#x2014;in some cases for the first time in millennia&#x2014;to resume their natural ecological processes. We share his awe, and wonder, as he kayaks among dolphins and seabirds off the coast of Wales and wanders the forests of Eastern Europe, where lynx and wolf packs are reclaiming their ancient hunting grounds. Through his eyes, we see environmental success&#x2014;and begin to envision a future world where humans and nature are no longer separate and antagonistic, but are together part of a single, healing world.<br> <br> Monbiot&#x2019;s commitment is fierce, his passion infectious, his writing compelling. Readers willing to leave the confines of civilization and join him on his bewitching journey will emerge changed&#x2014;and ready to change our world for the better.</p></p><p>George Monbiot is a journalist, environmentalist, <i>Guardian</i> columnist, and the author of numerous books.&#x201c;As a passionate polemic, <i>Feral</i> could not be more rigorously researched, more elegantly delivered, or more timely. We need such big thinking for our own sakes and those of our children. Bring on the wolves and whales, I say, and, in the words of Maurice Sendak, let the wild rumpus start.&#x201d; (Philip Hoare <i>Sunday Telegraph, Book of the Week</i>)<br><br>"Monbiot challenges the reader to think more deeply on the subject of rewilding. . . . Throughout the book, Monbiot's lyrical and provocative tales of his efforts to reengage with the wild stimulate the senses and arouse an innate urge to affiliate with nature. . . . Monbiot takes you on an emotional roller coaster, at times plunging you into troughs of despair as he discusses the bleak plight of much of our wildlife and, at others, raising you up on peaks of hope as he discusses how much of the degradation can be reversed. . . . Part personal journal, part restoration ecology primer, <i>Feral </i>popularizes the concept of rewilding and will likely prompt wildlife managers, landowners, policy-makers, and the general public to question their perception of the natural world and its role in our lives." (<i>Science</i>)<br><br>"The world knows George Monbiot mostly from his powerful and perceptive journalism. But this is a whole different order of writing and thinking, a primal account of an unstifled world." (Bill McKibben)<br><br>"George Monbiot is always original--both in the intelligence of his opinions and the depth and rigour of his research. In this unusual book he presents a persuasive argument for a new future for the planet, one in which we consciously progress from just conserving nature to actively rebuilding it." (Brian Eno)<br><br><i>"Feral</i>&nbsp;has really opened my mind to the history and possibilities of our landscape. It reflects a very real need in us all right now to be released from our claustrophobic monoculture and sense of powerlessness. To break the straight lines into endless branches. To free our land from its absent administrators. To rewild both the landscape and ourselves. It is the most positive and daring environmental book I have read. In order to change our world you have to be able to see a better one. I think George has done that." (Thom Yorke)<br><br>"Monbiot is at his lyrical best sharing his own very private encounters with the natural world. Then his craving for a 'richer, rawer life' becomes not just compelling but irresistible."

Series for Students)</h2><p><p><strong>Has Science Discovered God?</strong></p><p>When Lee Strobel was a high school freshman, science convinced him that God didn&#x2019;t exist. Since then, however, incredible scientific discoveries have not only helped restore Lee&#x2019;s faith, but have strengthened it.</p><p>Lee is not alone. More and more scientists, confronted with startling, cutting-edge evidence from many areas of research, no longer believe the universe just &#x201c;happened&#x201d; or that life arose by mere chance. Behind a universe of staggering complexity, they are seeing signs of a Master Designer.</p><p>Are your science textbooks still telling you the same &#x201c;facts&#x201d; that Lee&#x2019;s did years ago? Prepare to be astonished by what some of today&#x2019;s most respected experts have to say about:</p><ul><li>The birth of the universe</li><li>Darwinism and the origin of life</li><li>The astounding fine-tuning of the cosmos</li><li>Amazing molecular machines and DNA research</li></ul><p>Weigh the evidence for yourself. Then consider this question: Could it be that the universe looks designed ... because it is?</p></p><p>Are Christianity and science incompatible? If there is a God, is he only an impersonal starter force? An introductory high school biology class first propelled Lee Strobel toward a life of atheism. God and science, he reasoned, were mutually exclusive. When the former legal editor of the <i>Chicago Tribune</i> converted to Christianity, he decided to investigate the science he had once accepted as truth. Did science point toward or away from God? As Strobel interviews a variety of scientists on everything from debunking evolutionary icons to the implications of the Big Bang to the existence of the human soul, he builds his case: scientific evidence points toward Intelligent Design. <p> Although the discussion often veers into the academic, Strobel works hard to make it accessible to those without scientific training. Throughout the book, he salts interview transcript information with interesting personal stories of his own spiritual and scientific quest for knowledge, as well as sometimes over-detailed descriptions of the actual interviews (right down to the type of beverages consumed). Each chapter contains suggestions for further reading on particular issues of science and faith. </p><p> Strobel concludes that, when correctly interpreted, science and biblical teaching support each other. He quotes physicist Paul Davies, "...science offers a surer path to God than religion." Open-minded readers will find that this book, and its questions for reflection and group study, invites conversation and investigation.--<i>Cindy Crosby</i></p>In The Case for a Creator&#x2014;Student Edition, bestselling author and former atheist Lee Strobel and popular writer Jane Vogel take younger readers on a remarkable investigation into the origin of the universe, interviewing many of the world&#x2019;s most renown scientists and following the evidence wherever it leads. <p>Their findings&#x2014;presented in the third blockbuster "Case" book student edition&#x2014;offer the most compelling scientific proof ever for intelligent design. Perfect for youth groups and young people eager to rebut the Darwinian and naturalistic views taught so commonly in schools.</p></p><h2>Accounting for Slavery: Masters and Management</h2><p><p><b>A <i>Five Books</i> Best Economics Book of the Year</b><br><b>A <i>Politico</i> Great Weekend Read</b><br><b>A Seminary Co-op Notable Book of the Year</b></p><p>The traditional story of modern management looks to the factories of England and New England, but Caitlin Rosenthal discovered that Southern planter-capitalists practiced an early form of scientific management. They took meticulous notes, carefully recording daily profits and productivity, and subjected their slaves to experiments and incentive strategies comprised of rewards and brutal punishment. Contrary to narratives that depict slavery as a barrier to innovation, <i>Accounting for Slavery</i> explains how elite planters turned their power over enslaved people into a productivity advantage. The result is a groundbreaking investigation of business practices in Southern and West Indian Plantations and an essential contribution to our understanding of slavery&#x2019;s relationship with capitalism.</p><p>&#x201c;Slavery in the United States was a business.

Much of the research around the business history of slavery focuses on the horrors of the trans-Atlantic slave trade and the business interests that fueled it. The common narrative is that today&#x2019;s modern management techniques were developed in the factories in England and the industrialized North of the United States, not the plantations of the Caribbean and the American South.

Lewis thought about everything was secretly present in what he said about anything. From apologetics to his thoughts on education, from his view of science to the role of government, from Natural Law to true manhood and womanhood--the breadth of Lewis's bright vision of life shines through in his beloved Chronicles. Come, learn to breathe Narnian air.</p><p>Careful readers of the Chronicles of Narnia know that there is more to the stories than meets the eye. There are layers of meaning in these fairy tales, spiritual gold beneath these Narnian hills. Those who delight in Lewis's magical world love to journey further up and further in, returning to Narnia again and again so that the same old stories can awaken our minds afresh to the wonder and glory all around us. But just how are these stories meant to change us? When we tumble back out of the wardrobe, in what ways should we be different? <br><br>Drawing upon Lewis's other writings and the Chronicles themselves, Joe Rigney shows the intricate and sometimes subtle ways that Lewis intended his beloved fairy stories to shape our hearts and minds. In doing so, he commends Lewis's Chronicles as a fruitful part of Christian discipleship, so that in reading the Narnian stories, breathing Narnian air, and seeking to live like Narnians, we are wonderfully transformed into the image of Jesus Christ--the Great Lion and High King Above All Kings.Joe Rigney is Assistant Professor of Theology and Christian Worldview at Bethlehem College and Seminary. He lives in Minneapolis with his wife and two sons, and he&#x2019;s convinced that he&#x2019;s descended from King Lune of Archenland on his father&#x2019;s side.</p><h2>Shelter of the Most High</h2><p>As trouble escalates in the world, we are all looking for a place of protection and safety.

Brugh Joy was a distinguished and respected member of the Los Angeles medical community. In that year he contracted a life-threatening disease that culminated in an illuminating meditation, which caused him to give up his medical practice abruptly. Six weeks later he discovered that his illness was totally cured. This experience pushed him to further his explorations into realms of healing involving body energies, the chakra system, meditation, and higher levels of consciousness.<br><br> In part, <i>Joy&#x2019;s Way</i> is the story of an extraordinary personal transformation. More significantly, it is a book that shows vividly the process of individual and group transformation and that rattles and re-forms the reader's concepts of the nature of reality.

His wife, Paola, urges him to spend time at a villa owned by a wealthy relative on Sant&#x2019;Erasmo, one of the largest islands in the <i>laguna</i>. There he passes his nights reading Pliny&#x2019;s <i>Natural History</i> and his days rowing with the villa&#x2019;s caretaker, Davide Casati, who is seeking the reason his bee colonies in the <i>laguna</i> are suffering. The recuperative stay goes according to plan until Casati goes missing following a sudden storm. Compelled to investigate, Brunetti sets aside his leave of absence to understand what happened to the man who has become his friend, in the process dredging up dark memories of an accident and cover-up years before. <i>Earthly Remains</i> is quintessential Donna Leon, a powerful addition to this enduring series.</p><p><b>Donna Leon</b> is the author of the highly acclaimed, internationally bestselling Commissario Guido Brunetti mystery series. The winner of the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, among other awards, Donna Leon lived in Venice for many years and now divides her time between Venice and Switzerland.Brunetti hurried after Casati, who was walking towards a rope tied to one of the stanchions. As he reached him, Brunetti looked into the water and saw floating a meter below them an unpainted puparin, the wood glowing in the sun. Closest kin to the gondola, though a bit shorter, the puparin was Brunetti's favorite rowing boat, responsive and light in the water; he had never seen a lovelier one than this. Even the cross board glowed in the light, almost as though Casati had given it a quick polish before he left the boat.<br> <br> Casati set the suitcase on the riva and crouched down at the edge. For a moment, Brunetti thought he was going to jump down into the boat, as if a young man's stunt would show Brunetti who was the real boatman. Instead, Casati sat on the riva, put one hand, palm flat, on the pavement and hopped down into the boat. He steadied himself before reaching up towards the suitcase. Brunetti moved fast and handed it to him, sat on the riva, judged the distance, and stepped down onto the horizontal board that spanned the boat.<br> <br> Involuntarily, it escaped Brunetti, "My God, she's beautiful." He couldn't stop his right hand from running along the top board that ran along the side, delighting in its cool smoothness. Looking back at Casati, he asked, "Who built her?"<br> <br> "I did," he answered. "But that was a long time ago."<br> <br> Brunetti said nothing in reply, busy studying the lines where the boards were invisibly caulked together, the hull's gentle curve to the right, the floor planking that showed no sign of moisture or dirt.<br> <br> "Complimenti," Brunetti said, turning away to face forward. He heard noises from behind, then Casati asked him to haul in the rubber tire that served as a buffer between the side of the boat and the stone wall. When Brunetti turned again, he saw Casati pull in the second tire and set it on the bottom of the boat, next to a piece of iron grating standing upright against the side. Brunetti faced forward again and heard the slap of the mooring rope tossed to the bottom of the boat, and then the smooth noise of the oar slipping into the f�rcola. A sudden motion pushed them away from the wall, and then he thought he heard Casati's oar slide into the water, and they were off.<br> <br> All he heard after that was the soft rubbing of the oar in the curve of the f�rcola, the hiss of water along the sides of the boat, and the occasional squeak of one of Casati's shoes as his weight shifted forwards or backwards. Brunetti gave himself to motion, glad of the passing breeze that tempered the savagery of the heat. He hadn't thought to bring a hat, and he had scoffed at Paola's insistence that he bring sun screen." <br> <br> Brunetti had rowed since he was a boy, but he knew he had little to contribute to the smoothness of this passage. There was not the slightest suggestion of stop and go, of a point where the thrust of the oar changed force: it was a single forward motion, like a bird soaring on rising drafts of air, or a pair of skis descending a slope. It was a whish or a shuuh, as hard to describe as to hear, even in the midst of the silence of the laguna. <br> <br> Brunetti turned his head to one side, then to the other, but there was only the soft, low hiss. He wanted to turn and look at Casati, as though by watching him row, he might store the motions away and copy them later, but he didn't want to shift his weight and thus change the balance of the boat, however minimally.<br> <br> A fisherman stood on the riva, looking both bored and impatient. When he saw the puparin, he raised his pole in salutation to Casati, but the heat rendered him silent as a fish.<br> <br> They reached the end of the island and turned eastward, following the shoreline past houses and abandoned fields. Even the turning had been effortless. Brunetti watched houses and trees glide past and only then did he realize how fast they were moving. He turned, then, to watch Casati row.<br> <br> Seeing the perfect balance of his motion, back and forth, back and forth, hands effortlessly in control of the oar, Brunetti thought that no man his own age or younger would be able to row like this because he would spoil it by showing off. The drops from the blade hit the water almost invisibly before the oar dipped in and moved towards the back. His father had rowed like this.<br> <br> This was perfection, Brunetti realized, as beautiful as any painting he had ever seen or voice he had ever heard.</p><h2>Field of Compassion: How the New Cosmology Is Transforming Spiritual Life</h2><p>The best-selling author of <i>Radical Amazement</i> articulates a transforming vision of spirituality that examines the intricate connectedness of the physical and spiritual worlds, a phenomenon she calls the "field of compassion."<br><br>In the tradition of Teilhard de Chardin and Thomas Berry, Judy Cannato invites spiritual seekers to embrace the way in which an understanding of religion and the spiritual path is informed and illumined by cutting-edge science. Cannato's newest book is a must-read for those interested in how the new cosmology and the Christian story can be understood in harmony with one another. She shows how modern scientific discoveries demonstrate that at the most fundamental of levels all life is connected and that humankind participates in the unfolding of the universe. This book's compelling and radical call to transformation will inspire readers to choose collaboration and peace over competition and conflict.</p><p><b>Judy Cannato</b> (1949-2011) was an author, retreat facilitator, and spiritual director best known for her work connecting the New Cosmology with Christian spirituality.

Late Afternoon.<br><br>&#x201c;I lied.&#x201d; The woman leaned against the minivan and felt the warmth of the afternoon sun radiate into her back from the shiny white metal. She took a moment to imagine the impact her words were having at the other end of the line. Then she went back to watching the handful of cars and SUVs that were scattered throughout the lengthening shadows of Caffee Junction&#x2019;s horseshoe-�shaped parking lot. There were more of them than she&#x2019;d have liked. More than there&#x2019;d been the previous two Fridays. But that was a minor detail, she told herself. An irritation. No reason to pull the plug.<br><br>&#x201c;I see.&#x201d; Lieutenant Hale&#x2019;s grip on the dull-�gray plastic handset grew tighter, and she wrestled the urge to smash it to pieces on her paper-�strewn desk. She&#x2019;d been moments away from leaving her office when the phone rang. Now there&#x2019;d be no chance of beating the afternoon rush. A fitting end to an already dire week, she thought, flipping her little robot-�shaped clock facedown on a stack of files. She didn&#x2019;t need to see the jagged second hand relentlessly taunting her as it swept around the dial. &#x201c;You lied. Mind telling me why?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Simple. Money. I was paid to say what I said.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Who paid you?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How much did you get?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Fifteen grand.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In one go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No. Five grand before I made the call. Five after. And five when the guy&#x2019;s suspension was confirmed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s a lot of money for one phone call.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why are you changing your story now?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got the money now. A chance to start over. I&#x2019;m driving to my sister&#x2019;s, in San Diego. And I wanted to set the record straight before I get there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK. Then this is what I need you to do. Come to the precinct. Write down what you just told me. Sign it. And stick around a couple of days, while we get this straightened out.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t. Already left town.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then come back. Just for a couple days.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No way. It&#x2019;s too dangerous. If whoever paid me finds out I&#x2019;m talking to you . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They won&#x2019;t. We can help you. Get you somewhere safe to stay. A hotel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;A hotel? Are you kidding me? I want a fresh start. A hotel&#x2019;s the worst place for someone like me. I&#x2019;m not coming back to Birmingham. Ever. I&#x2019;m hanging up now and&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait. You want to start over, you need a clear conscience. If you don&#x2019;t sign a statement, nothing will change. The detective will stay on suspension. There&#x2019;ll be an investigation. His career will be ruined. And that&#x2019;ll be on you.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Why? That doesn&#x2019;t make sense. I&#x2019;m telling the truth this time.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do I know that? Maybe you were telling the truth the first time, and you&#x2019;re lying now.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does it matter when I was lying? Point is, I&#x2019;m a liar. My word&#x2019;s not worth shit, either way.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;How do I know you&#x2019;re even who you say you are? Do you know how many crank calls I&#x2019;ve had since the story hit the papers?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You know who I am. I used those code words you gave me when I called before.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Conversations can be overheard. Code words can be bought. Or given away. Or stolen. They&#x2019;re a good start, but they&#x2019;re not conclusive. I need more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got my caller ID. You can see I&#x2019;m using the same phone. And you record all your calls, right? You can compare the tapes.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will. Count on it. But I still need more.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;OK. I can give you more. When I called, Tuesday, I had this all planned out. I figured the story would leak. So I added something on top of what I&#x2019;d been told to say. As insurance. I told you the detective had bitten me. Somewhere private. Remember? You wanted pictures. Doctors&#x2019; reports.&#x201d;<br><br>Lieutenant Hale didn&#x2019;t reply. When she&#x2019;d first spoken to this woman, her head had told her to reach for the rule book. As squad commander, she&#x2019;d done what she was required to do. But as an ex&#x2013;�street cop, every nerve in her body had screamed. She&#x2019;d felt like she was back in uniform, tiptoeing into an alley at night. And now, with this second call, it was as if an invisible hand was shoving her deeper into the darkness.<br><br>&#x201c;And I was right.&#x201d; The woman walked to the front of the van, taking care not to snag her heels in the cracks in the sun-�bleached pavement. &#x201c;You were loyal to your guy. You kept that part out of the papers. No one else but me could know about it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s not&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Goodbye, Lieutenant.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Wait!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t. I&#x2019;m going now. I&#x2019;ve got a lot of ground to cover. You&#x2019;re the police. I&#x2019;m trusting you. Do the right thing.&#x201d;<br><br>The woman ended the call. She broke the old-�style flip-�phone in half. Dropped the pieces on the ground. Climbed into the van. Scowled at the shiny, goalpost-�shaped H in the center of the steering wheel. Fired up the engine. Looped around the squat redbrick building, keeping her speed low as the van bounced clumsily across the pitted blacktop. Kept her distance from a blue Ford station wagon that was looking for a space in the shade. Then she left the parking lot. Followed the road back toward the interstate. And took the first on-�ramp she reached.<br><br>The one that led northeast.<br><br>Back to the Magic City.<br><br>Chapter Two<br><br>Saturday. Early Morning.<br><br>I&#x2019;m in the closet. In the hallway. Two boards are loose. In the floor. I pull them up. Wriggle into the space below. Slide one back in place, above me. Hook my arm through the gap. Grab Daddy&#x2019;s spare boots. Put them on the board, so it&#x2019;ll look like it hasn&#x2019;t been moved. Slide the other board back. Then settle down in the dark, to wait.<br><br>Just me and the bugs and the spiders.<br><br>Why&#x2019;s Daddy so late? I want him to come home. I want him to find me, so I can come out. I&#x2019;m hungry. And I need the bathroom. Real bad.<br><br>The front door opens, but the creaks don&#x2019;t sound the way they&#x2019;re supposed to. The door doesn&#x2019;t close all the way. Daddy doesn&#x2019;t step into the hall. He doesn&#x2019;t kick off his boots. He doesn&#x2019;t start looking for me. He doesn&#x2019;t begin our game, the way he always does.<br><br>Someone shouts: &#x201c;This is the police.&#x201d;<br><br>But it can&#x2019;t be the police, because Daddy&#x2019;s the police and it isn&#x2019;t Daddy&#x2019;s voice. It&#x2019;s another man&#x2019;s. A stranger&#x2019;s. Coming to hurt me?<br><br>&#x201c;Police! Show yourself. Whoever&#x2019;s in the house, show yourself. Right now.&#x201d;<br><br>I know the rules. Never come out. Wait for Daddy to find me. Whatever anyone says. It&#x2019;s the only way to stay safe. I hold my breath. Lie extra still.<br><br>&#x201c;Come on.&#x201d; Another voice that isn&#x2019;t Daddy&#x2019;s. &#x201c;The kid&#x2019;s got to be here, somewhere. We&#x2019;ve got to find him . . .&#x201d;<br><br>Cooper Devereaux&#x2019;s subconscious took the sound of the blows raining down on his cabin door and merged them into his dream. They became footsteps. Invading his house. Heading down the hallway. Reaching the closet. He was seconds away from being discovered . . .<br><br>But the noise kept on getting louder. It didn&#x2019;t stop. Ten seconds thundered by. Twenty. And that wasn&#x2019;t right. That wasn&#x2019;t how it was supposed to go. Something stirred, deep inside Devereaux&#x2019;s brain. It dragged him back to wakefulness, chasing away the unwelcome echoes from the past, leaving him blinking and disoriented on his moldering leather couch.<br><br>&#x201c;Hello?&#x201d; Devereaux reached down, picked his gun up from the floor, and pulled it back beneath his empty, stained, patchwork comforter cover. &#x201c;Who is it?&#x201d;</p><h2>Dragons (The Enchanted World)</h2><p>Collects legends from around the world concerning dragons and the struggles of heroes to slay dragons</p><p></p><h2>The Country Seats of the United States (Penn Studies in Landscape Architecture)</h2><p><p>William Russell Birch (1755-1834) has long been recognized as the first artist to achieve true commercial success in depicting American scenes for the domestic market. In his early career in London, Birch was influenced by the landscape painters whose work arose in the rich artistic ferment he encountered there in the 1770s and 1780s. After immigrating to Philadelphia in 1794, Birch sought to make his living recording scenes of the young republic, the better to promote "taste" in architecture and landscape design. The illustrations in his copperplate books soon proved to be vehicles for developing uniquely American pictorial subject matter. Of these, <i>The City of Philadelphia in 1800</i> became very successful, going through four editions from 1800 to 1828. Birch's third publication, <i>The Country Seats of the United States</i>, first published in 1808, was the result of the engraver's travels through the mid-Atlantic, as well as his intimate knowledge of the Philadelphia region. Both of Birch's American books are of considerable importance in documenting the cultural developments of the young nation.</p><p><i>The Country Seats of the United States</i> consists of twenty plates depicting eighteen estates, all but one of which were located on the eastern seaboard between Mount Vernon in the south and New York City in the north, with many properties along the Schuylkill River near Philadelphia. The remaining property in New Orleans was included to represent the recent Louisiana Purchase. Reproduced in its entirety with twenty color plates, this edition includes Birch's introduction and comments on the images, and a biographical essay situating Birch within his world and discussing the individual sites Birch depicted.</p></p><p>Emily T.

He wrote vast volumes about animals. He described them, classified them, told us where and how they live and how they develop in the womb or in the egg. He founded a science. It can even be said&nbsp;that he founded science itself.<br><br> <i>In The Lagoon</i>, acclaimed biologist Armand Marie Leroi recovers Aristotle&#x2019;s science. He revisits Aristotle&#x2019;s writings and the places where he worked. He goes to the eastern Aegean island of Lesbos to see the creatures that Aristotle saw, where he saw them. He explores Aristotle&#x2019;s observations,&nbsp;his deep ideas, his inspired guesses&#x2014;and the things he got wildly wrong. He shows how Aristotle&#x2019;s science is deeply intertwined with his philosophical system and reveals that he was not only the first biologist, but also one of the greatest.<br><br> <i>The Lagoon</i> is both a travelogue and a study of the origins of science. And it shows how a philosopher who lived almost two millennia ago still has so much to teach us today.</p><p><b>Armand Marie Leroi </b>is a professor of evolutionary development biology at Imperial College London. He is the author of Mutants: <i>On the Form, Variety and Errors of the<br>Human Body, </i>which has been published in eleven languages and won <i>The Guardian</i>&#x2019;s First Book Award in 2003. He is one of the UK&#x2019;s most prominent science media figures.<p>THE LAGOON<br><br>LESBOS (MYTILENE)<br><br> Among the isles of Greece there is a certain island,&nbsp;<i>insula nobilis et amoena</i>, which Aristotle knew well. It lies on the Asian side, between the Troad and the Mysian coast, and far into its bosom, by the little town of Pyrrha, runs a broad and sheltered lagoon.<br> D&#x2019;Arcy Wentworth Thompson,<br> <i>On Aristotle as a biologis</i>t (1913)<br><br> AT<br> ERATO<br><br>I<br><br> THERE IS A bookshop in old Athens. It is the loveliest I know. It lies in an alley near the Agora, next to a shop that sells canaries and quails from cages strung on the fa�ade. Wide louvres admit shafts of light that fall upon Japanese woodblock prints propped on a painter&#x2019;s easel. Beyond, in the gloom, there are crates of lithographs and piles of topographical maps. Terracotta tiles and plaster busts of ancient philosophers and playwrights do duty as bookends. The scent is of warm, old paper and Turkish tobacco. The stillness is disturbed only by the muted trills of the songbirds next door.<br><br> I have returned so often, and the scene is so constant, that it is hard to remember when, exactly, I first walked into George Papadatos&#x2019; bookshop. But I do recall that it was the drachma&#x2019;s last spring, when Greece was still poor and cheap and you landed at Ellinikon where the clacking flight boards listed Istanbul, Damascus, Beirut and Belgrade and you still felt as if you&#x2019;d travelled east. George &#x2013; lank grey hair, a bookman&#x2019;s paunch &#x2013; sat at his desk reading an old French political tract. Years ago, he told me, he had taught at Toronto &#x2013; &#x2018;But in Greece, they still had poets.&#x2019; He returned and named his store for the lyric muse.<br><br> Scanning his shelves, I saw Andrew Lang&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Odyssey</i>&nbsp;and three volumes of Jowett&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Plato.</i>&nbsp;They were the sort of books that might have belonged to an Englishman, a schoolmaster perhaps, who had retired to Athens, lived on his pension, and died there with some epigram of Callimachus on his lips. Whoever he was, he also left, in a row of Clarendon blue, the complete&nbsp;<i>Works of Aristotle Translated into English</i>, edited by J. S. Smith and W. D. Ross and published between 1910 and 1952. Ancient philosophy had never held much interest for me; I am a scientist. But I was idling and in no hurry to leave the calm of the shop. Besides, the title of the fourth volume in the series had caught my eye:&nbsp;<i>Historia animalium.</i>* I opened it and read about shells.<br><br> Again, in regard to the shells themselves, the testaceans present differences when compared to one another. Some are smooth-shelled, like the solen, the mussel and some clams, viz. those that are nicknamed &#x2018;milk-shells&#x2019;, while others are rough-shelled, such as the pool-oyster or edible oyster, the pinna and certain species of cockles, and the trumpet shells; and of these some are ribbed, such as the scallop and a certain kind of clam or cockle, and some are devoid of ribs, as the pinna and another species of clam.<br><br> The shell, for me it is always&nbsp;<i>the</i>&nbsp;shell, had sat in the sunlight of a bathroom windowsill, buried in sedimentary layers of my father&#x2019;s shaving talc, seemingly for ever. My parents must have picked it up somewhere along the Italian littoral, though whether in Venice, Naples, Sorrento or Capri neither could recall. A summer souvenir, then, of when they were still young and newly married; but indifferent to such associations I coveted the thing for itself: the chocolate flames of its helical whorls, the deep orange of its mouth, the milk of its unreachable interior.<br><br> I can describe it so exactly for, although this was so many years ago, I have it before me now. It is a perfect specimen of&nbsp;<i>Charonia variegata</i>&nbsp;(Lamarck), the shell of Minoan frescos and Sandro Botticelli&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Venus and Mars.</i>&nbsp;The trumpet of Aegean fishermen, weathered shells with a hole punched through the apex can still be found in Monastiraki stalls. Aristotle knew it as the&nbsp;<i>k&#x113;ryx</i>, which means &#x2018;herald&#x2019;.<br><br> It was the first of many: shells, apparently infinitely various, yet possessed of a deep formal order of shapes and colours and textures that could be endlessly rearranged in shoeboxes until finally, seeing that the mania would not cease, my father had a cabinet built to house them all. A drawer for the luminous cowries, another for the thrillingly venomous cones, one for the filigree-sculptured murexes, others for the olives, marginellas, whelks, conchs, tuns, littorines, nerites, turbans and limpets, several for the bivalves and two, my pride, for the African land snails, gigantic creatures that no more resemble a common garden snail than an elephant does a rabbit. What pure delight. My mother&#x2019;s heroic contribution was to type the catalogue and so become Conseil to my Aronnax, an expert in the Latinate hierarchy of Molluscan taxonomy, though her knowledge was entirely theoretical for she could scarcely tell one species from another.<br><br> At eighteen, convinced that my contribution to science would be vast malacological monographs that would be the last word for a hundred years (at least) on the Achatinidae of the African forests or, perhaps &#x2013; for my attention tended to wander &#x2013; the Buccindae of the Boreal Pacific, I went to learn marine biology at a research station perched on the edge of a small Canadian inlet. There, a marine ecologist, an awesome Blackbeard-like figure whose violent impatience was checked only by kindness to match, showed me how to peel away the layers of a gastropod&#x2019;s tissues, more fragile than rice-paper, with forceps honed to a needle point and so reveal the severe functional logic that lies within. Another, a professorial cowboy-aesthete &#x2013; the combination seems incongruous yet he was utterly of a piece &#x2013; taught me how to think about evolution, which is to say about almost everything. I heard a legend speak, a scientist who had Laozi&#x2019;s gaunt cheeks and wispy beard and who, blind from childhood, had discovered the one part of the empirical world that need not be seen and still can be known &#x2013; shell form, of course &#x2013; and had told its tales by touch alone. There was also a girl. She had wind-reddened skin and black hair and could pilot a RIB powered by twin Johnson 60s through two-metre surf and not flinch.<br><br> All this is, as I said, long ago. I did not, as it happens, ever write those taxonomic monographs. Science always sets you on entirely unpredictable paths and, by the time I walked into George Papadatos&#x2019; bookshop, I had long put my shells away. Still, it all came back to me when I read Aristotle on shells and when, reading further, I came across his description of the internal anatomy of the creatures that make them:<br><br> The stomach follows close upon the mouth and, by the way, this organ in the snail resembles a bird&#x2019;s crop. Underneath come two white formations, mastoid or papillary in form; and similar formations are found in the cuttlefish also, only that they are of a firmer consistency [in snails] than in the cuttlefish. After the stomach comes the oesophagus, simple and long, extending to the poppy or quasi-liver, which is in the innermost recesses of the shell. All these statements may be verified in the case of the purple murex and the&nbsp;<i>k&#x113;ryx</i>&nbsp;by observation within the whorl of the shell. What comes next .&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br><br> You may wonder that such blunt words can carry beauty, but for me they did. It was not mere nostalgia, though certainly that played its part. No, it was that I understood, understood against all expectation and probability, what he meant. He had evidently walked down to the shore, picked up a snail, asked &#x2018;what&#x2019;s inside?&#x2019;; had looked, and had found what I found when, twenty-three centuries later, I repeated the exercise. We scientists are no more given to rootling in history&#x2019;s byways than we are to metaphysical speculation. We are, by nature, a forward-looking lot. But this was too wonderful to be ignored.<br><br> II<br><br> THE DISTRICT KNOWN as the Lyceum lay just beyond Athens&#x2019; stone walls. A sanctuary dedicated to Apollo Lykeios &#x2013; Apollo of the Wolves &#x2013; it contained, among other things, a military training ground, a racetrack, a collection of shrines and a park. The topography is uncertain. Strabo is vague, Pausanias is worse, and, besides, one wrote twenty years, the other two centuries after Sulla, a Roman general, had razed the place to the ground. Sulla also chopped down the ancient plane trees that lined its winding paths and built siege engines from their wood. Cicero, visiting in 97 BC, found only a waste. His visit was an homage to Aristotle who, more than two hundred years before, had rented a few buildings and set up his school there. It was said that Aristotle used to walk the Lyceum&#x2019;s shady paths and that, as he did so, he talked.<br><br> He talked about the proper constitution of the city: the dangers of tyranny &#x2013; and of democracy too. And of how Tragedy purifies through pity and fear. He analysed the meaning of the Good,&nbsp;<i>to agathon</i>, and spoke of how humans should spend their lives. He set his students logical puzzles and then demanded that they reconsider the nature of fundamental reality. He spoke in terse syllogisms and then illustrated his meaning with endless lists of things. He began his lectures with the most abstract principles and followed their consequences for hours till yet another part of the world lay before them dissected and explained. He examined his predecessors&#x2019; thought &#x2013; the names of Empedocles, Democritus, Socrates and Plato were forever on his lips &#x2013; sometimes with grudging recognition, often with scorn. He reduced the chaos of the world to order, for Aristotle was, if nothing else, a systems man.<br><br> His students would have regarded him with awe and, perhaps, a little fear. Some of his sayings suggest an acid tongue: &#x2018;The roots of education are bitter, but the fruit is sweet.&#x2019; &#x2018;Educated men are as superior to uneducated as the living are to the dead.&#x2019; Of a rival philosopher he said: &#x2018;It would be a shame for me to keep quiet if Xenocrates is still talking.&#x2019; There is a description too, and it isn&#x2019;t an attractive one. It&#x2019;s of a dandy who wore lots of rings, dressed rather too well and fussed about with his hair. Asked why people seek beauty in others he replied: &#x2018;That&#x2019;s a question only a blind man would ask.&#x2019; It is said that he had thin legs and small eyes.<br><br> This may be mere gossip: the Athenian schools were forever feuding and the biographers are unreliable. But we know what Aristotle talked about, for we have his lecture notes. Among them are the works &#x2013;&nbsp;<i>Categories, On Interpretation, Prior Analytics, Posterior Analytics, Topics, Sophistical Refutations</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Metaphysics</i>, the&nbsp;<i>Eudemian</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Nicomachean Ethics, Poetics, Politics</i>&nbsp;&#x2013; that loom over the history of Western thought like a mountain range. Sometimes clear and didactic, often opaque and enigmatic, riddled with gaps and rife with redundancies, they are the books that have made Aristotle&#x2019;s name immortal. That we have them at all is mostly due to Sulla, who looted the library of a Piraeus bibliophile and took them back to Rome. But these philosophical texts are only a part &#x2013; and not even the most important part &#x2013; of what Aristotle wrote. Among the books that Sulla stole were at least nine that were all about animals.<br><br> Aristotle was an intellectual omnivore, a glutton for information and ideas. But the subject he loved most was biology. In his works the &#x2018;study of nature&#x2019; springs to life for he turns to describing and explaining the plants and animals that, in all their variety, fill our world.* To be sure, some philosophers and physicians had dabbled in biology before him, but Aristotle gave much of his life to it. He was the first to do so. He mapped the territory. He invented the science. You could argue that invented science itself.<br><br> At the Lyceum he taught a great course in natural science. In the introduction to one of his books there is a sketch of the curriculum: first, an abstract account of nature, then the motion of the stars, then chemistry, meteorology and geology in quick order, and then, the bulk of it, an account of living things &#x2013; the creatures that he knew, among them, us. His zoological works are the notes for this part of the course. There was one book on what we call comparative zoology, another on functional anatomy, two on how animals move, one on how they breathe, two on why they die, one on the systems that keep them alive. There was a series of lectures on how creatures develop in the womb and grow into adults, reproduce and begin the process again &#x2013; for there&#x2019;s a book on that too. There were also some books about plants, but we don&#x2019;t know what they contained. They are lost along with about two-thirds of his works.<br><br> The books that we have are a naturalist&#x2019;s joy. Many of the creatures that he writes about live in or near the sea. He describes the anatomies of sea urchins, ascidians and snails. He looks at marsh birds and considers their bills, legs and feet. Dolphins fascinate him for they breathe air and suckle their young yet look like fish. He mentions more than a hundred different kinds of fishes &#x2013; and tells of what they look like, what they eat, how they breed, the sounds they make and the patterns of their migrations. His favourite animal was that weirdly intelligent invertebrate, the cuttlefish. The dandy must have plundered fish markets and hung around wharves talking to fishermen.<br><br> But most of Aristotle&#x2019;s science isn&#x2019;t descriptive at all: it&#x2019;s answers to questions, hundreds of them. Why do fishes have gills and not lungs? Fins but not legs? Why do pigeons have a crop and elephants a trunk? Why do eagles lay so few eggs, fish so many, why are sparrows so salacious? What is it with bees, anyway? And the camel? Why do humans, uniquely, walk upright? How do we see &#x2013; smell &#x2013; hear &#x2013; touch? What is the influence of the environment on growth? Why do children sometimes look like their parents, and sometimes not? What is the purpose of testicles, menstruation, vaginal fluids, orgasms? What is the cause of monstrous births? What is the&nbsp;<i>real</i>&nbsp;difference between male and female? How do living things stay alive? Why do they reproduce? Why do they die? This is not a tentative foray into a new field: it&#x2019;s a complete science.<br><br> Perhaps&nbsp;<i>too</i>&nbsp;complete, for sometimes it seems that Aristotle has an explanation for everything. Diogenes Laertius, the gossiping biographer who recorded Aristotle&#x2019;s looks (five centuries after his death), said, &#x2018;In the sphere of natural science he surpassed all other philosophers in the investigation of causes, so that even the most insignificant phenomena were explained by him.&#x2019; His explanations penetrate his philosophy. There is a sense in which his philosophy&nbsp;<i>is</i>&nbsp;biology &#x2013; in which he devised his ontology and epistemology just to explain how animals work. Ask Aristotle: what, fundamentally,&nbsp;<i>exists</i>? He would not say &#x2013; as a modern biologist might &#x2013; &#x2018;go ask a physicist&#x2019;; he&#x2019;d point to a cuttlefish and say &#x2013;&nbsp;<i>that.<br></i><br> The science that Aristotle began has grown great, but his descendants have all but forgotten him. Throw a stone in some boroughs of London, Paris, New York or San Francisco and you&#x2019;ll be sure to hit a...</p></p><h2>Preacher&#39;s Fury (Preacher/First Mountain Man)</h2><p><b>The Greatest Western Writer Of The 21st Century</b><br><br><b>A Woman For The Winter. </b><br><br>Montana Territory and a band of Assiniboine Indians give Preacher shelter for the winter.

Engrossed in the study of a small ivory shatranj board with pieces of ebony and horn, and in the stew of chickpeas, carrots, dried lemons and mutton for which the caravansary was renowned, the African held the place nearest the fire, his broad back to the bird, with a view of the doors and the window with its shutters thrown open to the blue dusk. On this temperate autumn evening in the kingdom of Arran in the eastern foothills of the Caucasus, it was only the two natives of burning jungles, the African and the myna, who sought to warm their bones. The precise origin of the African remained a mystery. In his quilted gray bambakion with its frayed hood, worn over a ragged white tunic, there was a hint of former service in the armies of Byzantium, while the brass eyelets on the straps of his buskins suggested a sojourn in the West. No one had hazarded to discover whether the speech of the known empires, khanates, emirates, hordes and kingdoms was intelligible to him. With his skin that was lustrous as the tarnish on a copper kettle, and his eyes womanly as a camel&#x2019;s, and his shining pate with its ruff of wool whose silver hue implied a seniority attained only by the most hardened men, and above all with the air of stillness that trumpeted his murderous nature to all but the greenest travelers on this minor spur of the Silk Road, the African appeared neither to invite nor to promise to tolerate questions. Among the travelers at the caravansary there was a moment of admiration, therefore, for the bird&#x2019;s temerity when it seemed to declare, in its excellent Greek, that the African consumed his food in just the carrion-scarfing way one might expect of the bastard offspring of a bald-pated vulture and a Barbary ape. <br><br>For a moment after the insult was hurled, the African went on eating, without looking up from the shatranj board, indeed without seeming to have heard the remark at all. Then, before anyone quite understood that calumny so fine went beyond the powers even of the myna, and that the bird was innocent, this once, of slander, the African reached his left hand into his right buskin and, in a continuous gesture as fluid and unbroken as that by which a falconer looses his fatal darling into the sky, produced a shard of bright Arab steel, its crude hilt swaddled in strips of hide, and sent it hunting across the benches. <br><br>Neither the beardless stripling who was sitting just to the right of its victim, nor the one-eyed mahout who was the stripling&#x2019;s companion, would ever forget the dagger&#x2019;s keening as it stung the air. With the sound of a letter being sliced open by an impatient hand, it tore through the crown of the wide-brimmed black hat worn by the victim, a fair-haired scarecrow from some fogbound land who had ridden in, that afternoon, on the Tiflis road. He was a slight, thin-shanked fellow, gloomy of countenance, white as tallow, his hair falling in two golden curtains on either side of his long face. There was a rattling twang like that of an arrow striking a tree. The hat flew off the scarecrow&#x2019;s head as if registering his surprise and stuck to a post of the daub wall behind him as he let loose an outlandish syllable in the rheumy jargon of his homeland. <br><br>In the fireplace a glowing castle of embers subsided to ash. The mahout heard the iron ticking of a kettle on the boil in the kitchen. The benches squeaked, and travelers spat in anticipation of a fight. <br><br>The Frankish scarecrow slipped out from under his impaled hat and unfolded himself one limb at a time, running his fingers along the parting in his yellow hair. He looked from the African to the hat and back. His cloak, trousers, hose and boots were all black, in sharp contrast with the pallor of his soft hands and the glints of golden whisker on his chin and cheeks, and if he was not a priest, then he must, thought the mahout, for whom a knowledge of men was a necessary corollary to an understanding of elephants, be a physician or an exegete of moldering texts. The Frank folded his arms over his bony chest and stood taking the African&#x2019;s measure along the rule of his bony nose. He wore an arch smile and held his head at an angle meant to signify a weary half-amusement like that which plagued a philosophical man when he contemplated this vain human show. But it was apparent to the old mahout even with his one eye that the scarecrow was furious over the injury to his hat. His funereal clothes were of rich stuff, free of travel stains, suggesting that he maintained their appearance, and his own, with fierce determination. <br><br>The Frank reached two long fingers and a thumb into the wound in his hat, grimaced and with difficulty jerked out the dagger from the post. He turned the freed hat in his hands, suppressing the urge to stroke it, it seemed to the mahout, the way he himself would stroke the stubbled croup of a beloved dam as she expired. With an air of incalculable gravity, as if confiding the icon of a household god, the Frank passed the hat to the stripling and carried the dagger across the room to the African, who had long since returned to his bowl of stew. <br><br>&#x201c;I believe, sir,&#x201d; the Frank informed the African, speaking again in good Byzantine Greek, &#x201c;that you have mislaid the implement required for the cleaning of your hooves.&#x201d; The Frank jabbed the point of the dagger down into the table beside the shatranj board, jostling the pieces. &#x201c;If I am mistaken as to the actual nature of your lower extremities, I beg you to join me in the courtyard of this house, at your leisure but preferably soon, so that, with the pedagogical instrument of your choice, you may educate me.&#x201d; <br><br>The Frank waited. The one-eyed mahout and the stripling, wondering, waited. By the door to the inn yard, where the ostler leaned, whispered odds were laid and taken, and the mahout heard the clink of coins and the squeak of a chalk wielded by the ostler, a Svan who disdained the distinction between turning a profit from seeing to the comfort of his guests and that of turning one from watching them die. <br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry to report,&#x201d; the African said, rising to his feet, his head brushing the beams of the sloping roof, speaking in the lilting, bastardized Greek used among the mercenary legions of the emperor at Constantinople, &#x201c;that my hearing shares in the general decay of the broken-down black-assed old wreck you see before you.&#x201d; <br><br>The African yanked the shard of Arab steel from the table and with it went in search of the Frank&#x2019;s voice box, ending his quest no farther from the pale knuckle of the Frank&#x2019;s throat than the width of the blade itself. The Frank fell back, bumping into a pair of Armenian wool factors at whom he glared as if it were some clumsiness of theirs and not his cowardly instinct for self-preservation that had cost him his footing. <br><br>&#x201c;But I take your gist,&#x201d; the African said, returning the dagger to his boot. On the ostler&#x2019;s slate the odds began to run heavily against the Frank. <br><br>The African restored the shatranj board and pieces to a leather pouch, wiped his lips and then pushed past the Frank, past the craning heads along the benches and went out into the inn yard to kill or be killed by his insulter. As the men trooped after him into the torch-lit courtyard, carrying cups of wine, wiping their bearded chins on their forearms, the weapons belonging to the combatants were fetched from a rack in the stable. <br><br>If because of his immensity, the span of his arms and his homicidal air, and despite his protestations of senescence, which were universally regarded as gamesmanship, the betting had been inclined to favor the African before the weapons were fetched, the arming of the two men decided it. The Frank carried only a long, absurdly thin bodkin that might serve, in a pinch, to roast a couple of birds over an open fire, if they were not too plump. The travelers had a good laugh at &#x201c;the tailor with his needle&#x201d; and then pondered the mystery of the African&#x2019;s choice of sidearm, a huge Viking ax, its haft an orgy of interpenetrating runes, the quarter-moon of its blade glowing cold, as with satisfied recollection of all the heads it had ever lopped from spouting necks. <br><br>Under the full moon of the month of Mehr, with the torches hissing, the African and the Frank circled an ambit of packed earth. The Frank minced and scissored on his walking-stick legs, the tip of his bodkin indicating the heart of the African, glancing from time to time at his own fine black boots as they threaded a course through the archipelago of camel and horse turds. The African employed an odd crabwise scuttling style of circling, knees bent, eyes fixed on the Frank, the ax held loosely in his left fist. The awkward, almost fond way they went about readying themselves to murder each other moved the old mahout, who had trained a thousand war elephants to kill and so recognized the professional quality of the interest these two combatants were taking in the fight. But the other travelers jostling under the eaves and archways of the inn yard, who knew nothing of the intimacy of slaughter, grew impatient. They jeered the combatants, urging them to hurry so they could all finish their suppers and file off to bed. Half-maddened by boredom, they doubled their wagers. Word of the duel had reached the village down the hill, and the gate of the inn yard was lively with women, children and sad-faced lean men with heroic moustaches. Boys climbed to the roof of the inn, shook their fists and hooted as the Frank and the African emptied their heads of last regrets. <br><br>Then the ax, humming, seemed to drag the African toward the belly of the Frank.

We share our experience, strength, and hope with one another to arrest the disease of debting. We have found compulsive debting to be a painful, confusing, and destructive disorder. Compulsive debting takes many forms from incurring unsecured debt to compulsive shopping, from grandiose thinking to poverty/not enough mentality. All these forms of debting seriously affect our quality of life&#x2014;financially, emotionally, mentally, spiritually, physically, and socially. </p><p>As members of Debtors Anonymous, we have chosen a spiritual path of healing and growth which requires working the &#x201c;Twelve Steps&#x201d; and using the &#x201c;Twelve Tools of DA.&#x201d; They are the foundation of our recovery process. As a result of beginning this recovery process, we have been able to achieve solvency and prosperity; we are beginning to understand ourselves and form genuine loving connections with others and discover a relationship with a Higher Power of our own choice. </p><p>We have created this recovery book to share our Program with other compulsive debtors so that they might understand what we have come to know about debting and experience the relief we have found. The stories we have gathered are a collection of members&#x2019; experiences with debting which share: &#x201c;What it was like for them, What happened, How they changed, and What it is like now...&#x201d; </p><p>We hope that if you identify with some, or all, aspects of compulsive debting, you will join us on the path to recovery and find the peace, joy, love and financial solvency that are here for you.</p>There are 38 authors of this book.

In this powerful book, Beryl Satter identifies the true causes of the city&#x2019;s black slums and the ruin of urban neighborhoods throughout the country: not, as some have argued, black pathology, the culture of poverty, or white flight, but a widespread and institutionalized system of legal and financial exploitation. </p><p>In Satter&#x2019;s riveting account of a city in crisis, unscrupulous lawyers, slumlords, and speculators are pitched against religious reformers, community organizers, and an impassioned attorney who launched a crusade against the profiteers&#x2014;the author&#x2019;s father, Mark J. Satter. At the heart of the struggle stand the black migrants who, having left the South with its legacy of sharecropping, suddenly find themselves caught in a new kind of debt peonage. Satter shows the interlocking forces at work in their oppression: the discriminatory practices of the banking industry; the federal policies that created the country&#x2019;s shameful "dual housing market"; the economic anxieties that fueled white violence; and the tempting profits to be made by preying on the city&#x2019;s most vulnerable population. </p><p>A monumental work of history, this tale of racism and real estate, politics and finance, will forever change our understanding of the forces that transformed urban America. </p></p><p><p>Beryl Satter was raised in Chicago, Skokie, and Evanston, Illinois. A graduate of the Harvard Divinity School and the Yale American studies program, she is the author of <i>Each Mind a Kingdom</i> and the chair of the Department of History at Rutgers University in Newark. For her work in progress on <i>Family Properties</i>, Satter received a J. Anthony Lukas citation. She lives in New York City.</p>From The Washington Post's Book World/washingtonpost.com Reviewed by review by david j. garrow In 1955, a young African American couple bought a house in Chicago's Hyde Park, the same neighborhood where Barack and Michelle Obama settled four decades later. Unlike the Obamas, Albert and Sallie Bolton had to purchase their home on an installment plan, because in the 1950s federal agencies refused to insure mortgage loans for buyers in racially integrated areas. Facing severely limited options, the Boltons contracted to pay the then-princely sum of $13,900 for a 100-year-old cottage without central heat. The seller, a white real estate agent named Jay Goran, specialized in just this kind of deal: He sold properties for a down payment of only a few hundred dollars, but if the purchasers missed even one installment, Illinois law allowed him to quickly and easily obtain an eviction order for less than $5. After the Boltons signed the contract, Goran added extra fees to their monthly bills. When they called to complain, he refused to speak to them. Then came repeated visits from housing code inspectors: First the couple had to remove their shutters, then rebuild the front porch, then fix the back porch. After 18 months, the Boltons fell behind on a payment, and Goran filed for eviction. Prospective buyers were already showing up at the house when the young couple sought help from a hardscrabble Chicago lawyer, Mark Satter. The novel lawsuit that Satter filed on behalf of the Boltons succeeded only in postponing their ouster until 1959. But in the meantime, Satter researched Goran's tactics, learning, for example, that the real estate speculator had purchased the house for $4,300 just a week before he sold it to the Boltons for triple the price, and that he recently had filed repossession claims on 20 other properties. Satter used the information to publicize how the rigid racial segregation of Chicago's housing market cost the city's black citizens $1 million a day in inflated prices and rents. Now his daughter, Rutgers University history professor Beryl Satter, has turned the story of her father and the Boltons into a penetrating examination of the financial discrimination that thousands of African Americans encountered in their northward migration to cities such as Chicago. Redlining is a familiar, if poorly understood, word for the refusal to insure mortgages in black neighborhoods. Satter shows how it worked in vivid, personal terms. Her painstakingly thorough portrayal of the human costs of financial racism is, in my view, the most important book yet written on the black freedom struggle in the urban North. In "Family Properties," she explains that it was not poverty that made black Chicagoans vulnerable to the likes of Jay Goran, because in 1960 two-thirds of the city's whites and 63 percent of its black residents had comparably modest incomes. Rather, she contends, the blame belongs squarely on "the racially biased credit policies of the nation's banking industry" and particularly the pre-1965 Federal Housing Administration. Following procedures in effect since the 1930s, appraisers rated properties using a color scheme: green for all-white areas, blue and yellow for areas with some foreigners or Jews, and red for areas with black residents. "The FHA's appraisal policies," Satter writes, "meant that blacks were excluded by definition from most mortgage loans" and that "the presence of a single black family usually led to mortgage redlining" of an entire neighborhood. Non-commercial purchasers (white as well as black) found themselves unable to obtain loans in those locations. Speculators like Goran pressed frightened white homeowners to sell, then quickly "flipped" the houses to families like the Boltons, who had no alternative method for buying a home. For black purchasers struggling to make inflated monthly payments, dividing and overcrowding their properties to generate income was a common solution. But that choice sapped aging structures, and it strained the fabric of many communities. In Chicago's tough West Side neighborhood of Lawndale, for instance, school enrollment increased 286 percent between 1951 and 1965. Even more than Hyde Park, Lawndale plays a central role in Satter's book, both because it experienced the worst concentration of Goran-style real estate sales and because it's where her father grew up. In the 1920s and '30s, when Mark Satter was a boy, the neighborhood was largely Jewish. He attended law school on scholarship, dabbled briefly in the Communist Party and gradually bought four small Lawndale apartment buildings to supplement his modest law practice. Between 1940 and 1960, Chicago's African American population surged from 277,000 to 812,000, and Mark Satter was one landlord who happily rented to blacks. "He was passionately, ideologically dedicated to the ideal of an interracial community in Lawndale," his daughter writes. In 1953, however, construction of what today is the Eisenhower Expressway "sliced the neighborhood in two and essentially destroyed it." The following year Mark Satter moved his family to a more middle-class area, and in 1955 Lawndale's major Jewish institutions decamped as the neighborhood became predominantly black. Real estate rip-offs proliferated. Satter was just 6 when her father died in 1965 at age 49, exhausted by his losing struggle to keep his Lawndale properties in respectable shape. Soon after his death, a grassroots group called the Contract Buyers League emerged and fought back against unfair real estate contracts by picketing banks and withholding payments to exploitative agents such as Goran. It had mixed success -- 70 families lost their homes -- but its battles led to congressional enactment of mid-1970s mortgage reform laws that improved banks' home loan practices and that Satter views as the "crowning achievement" of the activism her father pioneered. Half a century after her 1959 eviction, Sallie Bolton, now 88, still lives on Chicago's South Side, although not as close to the Obama family's grand home as she once briefly did. Predatory lending practices have reemerged in the form of subprime loans, and Satter reports that "between 2004 and 2006 the American city with the most residents holding subprime loans was . . . Chicago." "Family Properties" is a superbly revealing and often gripping book, one that will remind Chicagoans on temporary assignment in Washington all too poignantly of home. <br>Copyright 2009, The Washington Post.

So varied and manifold are the traditions about Mary, both popular and scholarly, that some would speak of "Mary" as a collective noun or refer, in George Tavard's memorable title, to The Thousand Faces of the Virgin Mary. <p>In her long-awaited book on Mary, which forms a diptych with Friends of God and Prophets, Elizabeth Johnson offers an interpretation of Mary that is theologically sound, spiritually empowering, ethically challenging, socially liberating, and ecumenically fruitful. In particular, she construes the image of Mary so as to be a source of blessing rather than blight for women's lives in both religious and political terms.</p></p><p>Elizabeth A. Johnson, C.S.J., is distinguished Professor of Theology at Fordham University. She has received numerous awards, including the Louisville Grawemeyer Award in Religion for She Who Is (1993), the American Academy of Religion Award for Excellence in the Study of Religion for Friends of God and Prophets (1999), and the Book Award of the College Theology Society for Truly Our Sister (2004). She was also the recipient of the John Courtney Murray Award of the Catholic Theological Society of America, the Jerome Award of the Catholic Library Association, and the Monika K. Hellwig Award of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities.&#x201c;Elizabeth Johnson proposes in this new book on Mary a radical return to the historical person of Miriam of Nazareth. ...One of the basic aims of the book is to help women all over the world affirm their rightful place in church and society and to propose a refreshing but very scholarly (theological and pastoral) approach to Miriam of Nazareth without developing a marian doctrinal theology in the traditional sense... Her inspiring meditations and analyses help us to better understand that the life of the historical woman Miriam of Nazareth is indeed a powerful journey of faith, with significance for people struggling to negotiate the challenges of faith today.&#x201d; &#x2013;Achiel Peelman, O.M.I., Theoforum, Vol. 35, No. 1, 2004<br><br>&#x201c;...comprehensive and provocative new presentation of a feminist Mariology. It deserves serious attention and critical evaluation... She periodically reports what the Catholic Church teaches, but she allows alternative views equal time without rebuttal...Truly Our Sister is a provocative book, and if it invites new attention and devotion to Mary by those who have felt alienated from her, that is all to the good.&#x201d; &#x2013;Sr. Sara Butler, M.S.B.T., Dunwoodie Review, 2004<br><br>&#x201c;I know of no book on Mary, past or present, that is superior to Truly Our Sister. It is remarkably creative, challenging, and ground-breaking, and yet deeply rooted in the Catholic tradition.

This book solidifies and enhances that well-deserved reputation.&#x201d; &#x2014;Richard P.

It should be read not only by theologians but by all Christians who have often inherited a distorted view of Mary's place with us and in the church." &#x2014;National Catholic Reporter<br><br>"Elizabeth A. Johnson, C.S.J....has now published a major theological study on Mary, and it is a very impressive work- comprehensive, erudite, critical, and passionate....What she has achieved is deeply admirable....This is a remarkable piece of work, an extensive tour of recent New Testament scholarship and its use of different methods and theoretical frameworks, leaving none of these familiar passages unaffected by critical questioning and fresh readings." &#x2014;Commonweal<br><br>"...it was well worth the wait....The author's impressive comprehension of the method of feminist theology shines throughout....It is difficult to find flaws in this work....[a] scholarly, well researched, beautifuly written and theologically profound book." &#x2014;America<br><br>&#x201c;Truly Our Sister is an inspiring book: poetically written and enlightening, it calls on all Elizabeth Johnson&#x2019;s learning and insight to present us with a view of Mary that is deeply satisfying not only intellectually, but emotionally and spiritually as well.

When his irreverent memoir appeared in 1975, it caused the most delightful of frissons, because the outside world then knew little about his workplace. Gill declares that "in the old Ross-Shawn days, what hadn't happened at the magazine was more worthy of note than what had." In reality, of course, a great deal was happening, and Gill seems to have heard and remembered it all. (This edition also contains a 1997 introduction, complete with acute and politic comments on the Bob Gottlieb and Tina Brown regimes.) But <i>Here at the New Yorker</i> is far from an expos�, consisting instead of the recollections of a lucky man who loves his work and many of his fellows. <p> Each reader will have his or her favorite anecdotes. Gill remembers taking the subway with Marianne Moore, who was squeezed next to two high school musicians. "Miss Moore stared with admiration at the drum, then said to the boy holding the drumsticks, 'Sonny, when the time comes, give it a big bang just for me.'" And, speaking of big bangs, the old <i>New Yorker</i> was far more squeamish--an organ in which bare nipples were nowhere to be found. Its first editor, Harold Ross, shown a cartoon complete with one such entity, growled: "Take that goddam tit up to Mrs. White and ask <i>her</i> what to do about it." His successor, William Shawn, shared his modesty though not his speech patterns. When Mr. Shawn asked the novelist Henry Green what led him to write <i>Loving</i>, Green's reply wasn't quite what he had expected. Alas, readers, you must turn to page 386 of this endlessly charming book for the offending response.</p>For over sixty years Brendan Gill has been a contented inmate of the singular institution known as The New Yorker. This affectionate account of the magazine, long known as a home for congenital unemployables, is a celebration of its wards and attendants - William Shawn, Harold Ross&#39;s gentle and courtly successor as editor; the incorrigible mischief-maker James Thurber; the two Whites, Katherine and E.B.; John O&#39;Hara, &#34;master of the fancied slight&#34;; and, among a hundred others, Peter Arno, Saul Steinberg, Edmund Wilson, Lewis Mumford, and Pauline Kael. Brendan Gill has known them all, and by virtue of his virtually total recall, keen eye, and impeccable prose, his diverting portraits of these eccentrics in rage and repose are amply supplied with both dimples and warts. Here at The New Yorkernow updated with a new introduction detailing the reigns of Robert Gottlieb and Tina Brown - is a delightful tour of New York&#39;s most glorious madhouse.</p><h2>The Story of Civilization, Part VII: The Age of Reason Begins</h2><p>The Story of Civilization, Volume VII: A history of European civilization in the period of Shakespeare, Bacon, Montaigne, Rembrandt, Galileo, and Descartes: 1558-1648.

Each pair of photographs is accompanied by an extended caption that tells the story of each child: Kaya in Tokyo, whose proud mother spends $1,000 a month on her dresses; Bilal the Bedouin shepherd boy, who sleeps outdoors with his father's herd of goats; the Nepali girl Indira, who has worked in a granite quarry since she was three; and Ankhohxet, the Kraho boy who sleeps on the floor of a hut deep in the Amazon jungle. Photographed over two years with the support of Save the Children (Italy), <i>Where Children Sleep</i> is both a serious photo-essay for an adult audience, and also an educational book that engages children themselves in the lives of other children around the world. Its cover features a child's mobile printed in glow-in-the-dark ink.</p><p>"a remarkable series capturing the diversity of and, often, disparity between children&#x2019;s lives around the world through portraits of their bedrooms" (Maria Popova <i>Brainpickings</i>)</p><h2>The Book Lover&#39;s Cookbook</h2><p>THE BOOK LOVER'S COOKBOOK<br><br>Recipes Inspired by Celebrated Works of Literature <br>and the Passages that Feature Them<br><br>Shaunda Kennedy Wenger and Janet Kay Jensen<br>Wake up to a perfect breakfast with Mrs. Dalby's Buttermilk Scones, courtesy of James Herriot's <i>All Things Bright and Beautiful</i> and Ichabod's Slapjacks, as featured in Washington Irving's <i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i>.

On all sides he beheld vast stores of apples, some hanging in oppressive opulence on the trees, some gathered into baskets and barrels for the market, others heaped up in rich piles for the cider press. Farther on he beheld great fields of Indian corn, with its golden ears peeping from hasty pudding; and the yellow pumpkins lying beneath them, turning up their fair round bellies to the sun, and giving ample prospects of the most luxurious of pies; and anon he passed the fragrant buckwheat fields, breathing the odor of the beehive, and as he beheld them, soft anticipations stole over his mind of dainty slapjacks, well buttered and garnished with honey or treacle, by the delicate little dimpled hand of Katrina Van Tassel. <br><b>&#x2014;Washington Irving, <i>The Legend of Sleepy Hollow</i></b><br><b>Behold!

He stirred and opened his eyes. "Was it something I said?" he asked groggily.<br><br>"You're suffocating me," she whispered lovingly. On the way to the bathroom she had an idea. She'd make Jesse some waffles. Waffles and muffins and bacon and . . . That was probably enough. Oh, and orange juice and coffee. Coffee with cinnamon in it.<br><br>Maybe she shouldn't make waffles, though. Her slapstick tendencies had a habit of rearing their ugly heads during waffle preparation. Still, she wanted to do something nice for him. She'd been staring at him for half an hour, and now she'd sort of woken him up . . . All in all, she felt she owed him waffles.

French more than twenty-five years ago, but his knowledge of and passion for the continent has the depth of a lifetime association. His experiences there awakened him as nothing before to the selfishness and shortsightedness of the rich, the suffering and dignity of the poor and the uses and abuses of power. And in this powerfully written, profoundly felt book, he gives us an unstinting account of the disastrous consequences of the fateful, centuries-old encounter between Africa and the West.<br><br>French delineates the betrayal and greed of the West&#x2013;often aided and abetted by Africa&#x2019;s own leaders&#x2013;that have given rise to the increasing exploitation of Africa&#x2019;s natural resources and its human beings. Coarse self-interest and outright greed once generated a need for the continent&#x2019;s rubber, cotton, gold and diamonds, not to mention slaves; now the attractions include offshore oil reserves and minerals like coltan, which powers cellular phones.<br><br>He takes us inside Nigeria, Liberia, Mali and the Congo, examining with unusual insight the legacy of colonization in the lives of contemporary Africans. He looks at the tragedies of the AIDS epidemic, the Ebola outbreak and the genocide that resulted in millions of deaths in Rwanda and the Congo. He makes clear the systematic failure of Western political leaders&#x2013;the nurturers of tyrants such as Mobuto Sese Seko and Laurent Kabila, whose stories are told here in full detail&#x2013;and the brutal excesses of the CIA.<br><br>In helping us to better understand the continent, and indeed Africans themselves, French helps us see as well the hope and possibility that lie in the myriad cultural strengths of Africa.</p><p>&#x201c;<i>A Continent for the Taking&#x201d;</i> is a compelling, passionate book richly informed by history and politics. It is also a moral book, an angry book by a writer who is outraged by how the west and, particularly, the United States has dealt with Africa to serve its own convenience. Never in the history of the world have so few done so much to destroy so many. French's book finally is the story of a man who loves the people and their customs&#x2014;a grown-up view of Africa by a black man who is neither estranged from the place nor romantically seeking home.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Gerald Early<br>"A brilliant and nuanced meditation on the complexities of contemporary Africa.

The large room was brightly lit and dominated by a massive flat-screen monitor, reporting on the flow of electricity throughout the power grid known as the Northeastern Interconnection, which provided electrical service in New York, Pennsylvania, New Jersey and Connecticut. The architecture and decor of the control center were quite modern&#x2014;if the year were 1960. </p><p>The supervisor squinted up at the board, which showed the juice arriving from generating plants around the country: steam turbines, reactors and the hydroelectric dam at Niagara Falls. In one tiny portion of the spaghetti depicting these electrical lines, something was wrong. A red circle was flashing. </p><p></p>Critical failure . . . <p>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; the supervisor asked. A gray-haired man with a taut belly under his short-sleeved white shirt and thirty years&#x2019; experience in the electricity business, he was mostly curious. While critical-incident indicator lights came on from time to time, actual critical incidents were very rare. </p><p>A young technician replied, &#x201c;Says we have total breaker separation. MH-Twelve.&#x201d; </p><p>Dark, unmanned and grimy, Algonquin Consolidated Substation 12, located in Harlem&#x2014;the &#x201c;MH&#x201d; for Manhattan&#x2014;was a major area substation. It received 138,000 volts and fed the juice through transformers, which stepped it down to 10 percent of that level, divided it up and sent it on its way. </p><p>Additional words now popped onto the big screen, glowing red beneath the time and the stark report of the critical failure. </p><p></p>MH-12 offline. <p>The supervisor typed on his computer, recalling the days when this work was done with radio and telephone and insulated switches, amid a smell of oil and brass and hot Bakelite. He read the dense, complicated scroll of text. He spoke softly, as if to himself, &#x201c;The breakers opened? Why? The load&#x2019;s normal.&#x201d; </p><p>Another message appeared. </p><p></p>MH-12 offline. RR to affected service area from MH-17, MH-10, MH-13, NJ-18. <p>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve got load rerouting,&#x201d; somebody called unnecessarily. </p><p>In the suburbs and countryside the grid is clearly visible&#x2014;those bare overhead high-tension wires and power poles and service lines running into your house. When a line goes down, there&#x2019;s little difficulty finding and fixing the problem. In many cities, though, like New York, the electricity flows underground, in insulated cables. Because the insulation degrades after time and suffers groundwater damage, resulting in shorts and loss of service, power companies rely on double or even triple redundancy in the grid. When substation MH-12 went down, the computer automatically began filling customer demand by rerouting the juice from other locations. </p><p>&#x201c;No dropouts, no brownouts,&#x201d; another tech called. </p><p>Electricity in the grid is like water coming into a house from a single main pipe and flowing out through many open faucets. When one is closed, the pressure in the others increases. Electricity&#x2019;s the same, though it moves a lot more quickly than water&#x2014;nearly 700 million miles an hour. And because New York City demanded a lot of power, the voltages&#x2014;the electrical equivalent of water pressure&#x2014;in the substations doing the extra work were running high. </p><p>But the system was built to handle this and the voltage indicators were still in the green. </p><p>What was troubling the supervisor, though, was why the circuit breakers in MH-12 had separated in the first place. The most common reason for a substation&#x2019;s breakers to pop is either a short circuit or unusually high demand at peak times&#x2014;early morning, both rush hours and early evening, or when the temperature soars and greedy air conditioners demand their juice. </p><p>None of those was the case at 11:20:20:003 a.m. on this comfortable April day. </p><p>&#x201c;Get a troubleman over to MH-Twelve. Could be a bum cable. Or a short in the&#x2014;&#x201d; </p><p>Just then a second red light began to flash. </p><p></p>Critical failure.<br>NJ-18 offline. <p>Another area substation, located near Paramus, New Jersey, had gone down. It was one of those taking up the slack in Manhattan-12&#x2019;s absence. </p><p>The supervisor made a sound, half laugh, half cough. A perplexed frown screwed into his face. &#x201c;What the hell&#x2019;s going on? The load&#x2019;s within tolerances.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Sensors and indicators all functioning,&#x201d; one technician called. </p><p>&#x201c;SCADA problem?&#x201d; the supervisor called. Algonquin&#x2019;s power empire was overseen by a sophisticated Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition program, running on huge Unix computers. The legendary 2003 Northeast Blackout, the largest ever in North America, was caused in part by a series of computer software errors. Today&#x2019;s systems wouldn&#x2019;t let that disaster happen again but that wasn&#x2019;t to say a different computer screwup couldn&#x2019;t occur. </p><p>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; one of his assistants said slowly. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;d think it&#x2019;d have to be. Diagnostics say there&#x2019;s no physical problem with the lines or switchgear.&#x201d; </p><p>The supervisor stared at the screen, waited for the next logical step: letting them know which new substation&#x2014;or stations&#x2014;would kick in to fill the gap created by the loss of NJ-18. </p><p>But no such message appeared. </p><p>The three Manhattan substations, 17, 10 and 13, continued alone in providing juice to two service areas of the city that would otherwise be dark. The SCADA program wasn&#x2019;t doing what it should have: bringing in power from other stations to help. Now the amount of electricity flowing into and out of each of those three stations was growing dramatically. </p><p>The supervisor rubbed his beard and, after waiting, futilely, for another substation to come online, ordered his senior assistant, &#x201c;Manually move supply from Q-Fourteen into the eastern service area of MH-Twelve.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Yessir.&#x201d; </p><p>After a moment the supervisor snapped, &#x201c;No, now.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Hm. I&#x2019;m trying.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Trying. What do you mean, <i>trying</i>?&#x201d; The task involved simple keyboard strokes. </p><p>&#x201c;The switchgear&#x2019;s not responding.&#x201d; </p><p>&#x201c;Impossible!&#x201d; The supervisor walked down several short steps to the technician&#x2019;s computer. He typed commands he knew in his sleep. </p><p>Nothing. </p><p>The voltage indicators were at the end of the green. Yellow loomed. </p><p>&#x201c;This isn&#x2019;t good,&#x201d; somebody muttered. &#x201c;This&#x2019;s a problem.&#x201d; </p><p>The supervisor ran back to his desk and dropped into his chair. His granola bar and Greek athlete cup fell to the floor. </p><p>And then another domino fell. A third red dot, like a bull&#x2019;s-eye on a target, began to throb, and in its aloof manner the SCADA computer reported: </p><p></p>Critical failure.<br>MH-17 offline. <p>&#x201c;No, not another one!&#x201d; somebody whispered. </p><p>And, as before, no other substation stepped up to help satisfy the voracious demands of New Yorkers for energy. Two substations were doing the work of five. The temperature of the electric wires into and out of those stations was growing, and the voltage level bars on the big screen were well into the yellow. </p><p></p>MH-12 offline. NJ-18 offline. MH-17 offline. RR to affected service areas from MH-10, MH-13. <p>The supervisor snapped, &#x201c;Get more supply into those areas. I don&#x2019;t care how you do it. Anywhere.&#x201d; </p><p>A woman at a nearby control booth sat up fast. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got forty K I&#x2019;m running through feeder lines down from the Bronx.&#x201d; </p><p>Forty thousand volts wasn&#x2019;t much and it would be tricky to move it through feeder lines, which were meant for about a third that much voltage. </p><p>Somebody else was able to bring some juice down from Connecticut. </p><p>The voltage indicator bars continued to rise but more slowly now. </p><p>Maybe they had this under control. &#x201c;More!&#x201d; </p><p>But then the woman stealing power from the Bronx said in a choking voice, &#x201c;Wait, the transmission&#x2019;s reduced itself to twenty thousand. I don&#x2019;t know why.&#x201d; </p><p>This was happening throughout the region. As soon as a tech was able to bring in a bit more current to relieve the pressure, the supply from another location dried up. </p><p>And all of this drama was unfolding at breathtaking speeds. </p><p><i>700 million miles an hour . . .</i> </p><p>And then yet another red circle, another bullet wound. </p><p></p>Critical failure.<br>MH-13 offline. <p>A whisper: &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t be happening.&#x201d; </p><p></p>MH-12 offline.

RR to affected service areas from MH-10. <p>This was the equivalent of a huge reservoir of water trying to shoot through a single tiny spigot, like the kind that squirts cold water out of a refrigerator door. The voltage surging into MH-10, located in an old building on West Fifty-seventh Street in the Clinton neighborhood of Manhattan, was four or five times normal load and growing. The circuit breakers would pop at any moment, averting an explosion and a fire, but returning a good portion of Midtown to colonial times. </p><p>&#x201c;North seems to be working better.

He has watched his last agent being shot, crossing from East to West Berlin, and his death marks the end of the Circus' East German network. But Control is planning an operation against the head of East German Intelligence. And Leamas is to be the instrument, set in East one last time....</p><p>It would be an international crime to reveal too much of the jeweled clockwork plot of Le Carr�'s first masterpiece, <i>The Spy Who Came in from the Cold</i>. But we are at liberty to disclose that Graham Greene called it the "finest spy story ever written," and that the taut tale concerns Alec Leamas, a British agent in early Cold War Berlin. Leamas is responsible for keeping the double agents under his care undercover and alive, but East Germans start killing them, so he gets called back to London by Control, his spy master. Yet instead of giving Leamas the boot, Control gives him a scary assignment: play the part of a disgraced agent, a sodden failure everybody whispers about. Control sends him back out into the cold--deep into Communist territory to checkmate the bad-guy spies on the other side. The political chessboard is black and white, but in human terms the vicinity of the Berlin Wall is a moral no-man's land, a gray abyss patrolled by pawns.<p> Le Carr� beats most spy writers for two reasons. First, he knows what he's talking about, since he raced around working for British Intelligence while the Wall went up. He's familiar with spycraft's fascinations, but also with the fact that it leaves ideals shaken and emotions stirred. Second, his literary tone has deep autobiographical roots. Spying is about betrayal, and Le Carr� was abandoned by his mother and betrayed by his father, a notorious con man. (They figure heavily in his novels <i>Single &amp; Single</i> and <i>A Perfect Spy</i>.) In a world of lies, Le Carr� writes the bitter truth: it's every man for himself. And may the best mask win. <i>--Tim Appelo</i></p>John le Carre was born in 1931. He attended the universities of Bern and Oxford and later taught at Eton.

Dewey - the famous gangbuster of the thirties, twice candidate for president, a maker of the modern Republican party, the key behind-the-scenes strategist of both Dwight Eisenhower&#39;s and Richard Nixon&#39;s Presidential nominations. On whatever level he acted, Thomas Dewey made government work, as he made the judicial system work when, as the famous New York district attorney, he rounded up the city&#39;s most powerful and infamous gangsters. He was ruthless as well as imaginative, ambitious as well as able. Dewey&#39;s record deserves to be known and his personality explored. Richard N. Smith has done both, against the backdrop of the political and economic desperation that launched Dewey to national prominence while he was still in his early thirties. Thomas E. Dewey and His Times profiles the system as well as a man who worked within it. Dewey was a creative adapter and his achievements and his failures say a great deal about the appeal of men &#34;who get things done.&#34;</p><p></p><h2>Inside the Company: CIA Diary</h2><p>The former CIA secret operations officer reconstucts his own and the intelligence agency&#39;s clandestine and subversive activities in Third World nations during his twelve-year stint with the world&#39;s largest spy organization</p><p></p><h2>Psychology: Themes and Variations, AP Edition, 9781337292160, 1337292168, 2017</h2><p>Psychology: Themes and Variations, AP Edition. hardcover.</p><p></p><h2>The First Kiss of Spring: An Eternity Springs Novel (Eternity Springs, 14)</h2><p><p>Spring has come to Eternity Springs in <i>The First Kiss of Spring</i>, the newest installment in this <i>New York Times</i> bestselling series by Emily March.<br><b></b><br><b>Life could be a dream...</b></p><p>Goal-oriented and gorgeous, Caitlin Timberlake's dreams took her to the top of the corporate ladder in New York City.

In this remarkable book, Shakespeare scholar James Shapiro explains when and why so many people began to question whether Shakespeare wrote his plays. Among the doubters have been such writers and thinkers as Sigmund Freud, Henry James, Mark Twain, and Helen Keller. It is a fascinating story, replete with forgeries, deception, false claimants, ciphers and codes, conspiracy theories&#x2014;and a stunning failure to grasp the power of the imagination. <p>As <i>Contested Will</i> makes clear, much more than proper attribution of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays is at stake in this authorship controversy. Underlying the arguments over whether Christopher Marlowe, Francis Bacon, or the Earl of Oxford wrote Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays are fundamental questions about literary genius, specifically about the relationship of life and art. Are the plays (and poems) of Shakespeare a sort of hidden autobiography? Do <i>Hamlet, Macbeth,</i> and the other great plays somehow reveal who wrote them? </p><p>Shapiro is the first Shakespeare scholar to examine the authorship controversy and its history in this way, explaining what it means, why it matters, and how it has persisted despite abundant evidence that William Shakespeare of Stratford wrote the plays attributed to him. This is a brilliant historical investigation that will delight anyone interested in Shakespeare and the literary imagination.</p></p><p><b>James Shapiro </b>is the Larry Miller Professor of English and Comparative Literature at Columbia University, where he has taught since 1985. Born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, he studied at Columbia and the University of Chicago. He is the author of several books, most recently <i>A Year in the Life of William Shakespeare: 1599. </i>He has been awarded numerous fellowships and grants from institutions such as the Guggenheim Foundation, the National Endowment for the Humanities, and the New York Public Library&#x2019;s Cullman Center for Scholars and Writers. He has written for <i>The New York Times, </i>the <i>Financial Times, </i>the <i>Los Angeles Times, </i>and other publications. Mr. Shapiro lives in New York with his wife and son.<b>PROLOGUE</b> <p>This is a book about when and why many people began to question whether William Shakespeare wrote the plays long attributed to him, and, if he didn&#x2019;t write them, who did. </p><p>There&#x2019;s surprising consensus on the part of both skeptics and defenders of Shakespeare&#x2019;s authorship about when the controversy first took root. Whether you get your facts from the <i>Dictionary of National Biography</i> or Wikipedia, the earliest documented claim dates back to 1785, when James Wilmot, an Oxford-trained scholar who lived a few miles outside of Stratford-upon-Avon, began searching locally for Shakespeare&#x2019;s books, papers, or any indication that he had been an author&#x2014;and came up empty-handed. Wilmot gradually came to the conclusion that someone else, most likely Sir Francis Bacon, had written the plays. Wilmot never published what he learned and near the end of his life burned all his papers. But before he died he spoke with a fellow researcher, a Quaker from Ipswich named James Corton Cowell, who later shared these findings with members of the Ipswich Philosophic Society. </p><p>Cowell did so in a pair of lectures delivered in 1805 that survive in a manuscript now located in the University of London&#x2019;s Senate House Library, in which he confesses to being &#x201c;a renegade&#x201d; to the Shakespearean &#x201c;faith.&#x201d; Cowell was converted by Wilmot&#x2019;s argument that &#x201c;there is nothing in the writings of Shakespeare that does not argue the long and early training of the schoolman, the traveler, and the associate of the great and learned. Yet there is nothing in the known life of Shakespeare that shows he had any one of the qualities.&#x201d; Wilmot is credited with being the first to argue, as far back as the late eighteenth century, for an unbridgeable rift between the facts of Shakespeare&#x2019;s life and what the plays and poems reveal about their author&#x2019;s education and experience. But both Wilmot and Cowell were ahead of their time, for close to a half-century passed before the controversy resurfaced in any serious or sustained way. </p><p>Since 1850 or so, thousands of books and articles have been published urging that someone other than Shakespeare wrote the plays. At first, bibliographers tried to keep count of all the works inspired by the controversy. By 1884 the list ran to 255 items; by 1949, it had swelled to over 4,500. Nobody bothered trying to keep a running tally after that, and in an age of blogs, websites, and online forums it&#x2019;s impossible to do justice to how much intellectual energy has been&#x2014;and continues to be&#x2014;devoted to the subject. Over time, and for all sorts of reasons, leading artists and intellectuals from all walks of life joined the ranks of the skeptics. I can think of little else that unites Henry James and Malcolm X, Sigmund Freud and Charlie Chaplin, Helen Keller and Orson Welles, or Mark Twain and Sir Derek Jacobi. </p><p>It&#x2019;s not easy keeping track of all the candidates promoted as the true author of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays and poems. The leading contenders nowadays are Edward de Vere (the Earl of Oxford) and Sir Francis Bacon. Christopher Marlowe, Mary Sidney, the Earl of Derby, and the Earl of Rutland have attracted fewer though no less ardent supporters. And more than fifty others have been proposed as well&#x2014;working alone or collaboratively&#x2014;including Sir Walter Ralegh, John Donne, Anne Whateley, Robert Cecil, John Florio, Sir Philip Sidney, the Earl of Southampton, Queen Elizabeth, and King James. A complete list is pointless, for it would soon be outdated. During the time I&#x2019;ve been working on this book, four more names have been put forward: the poet and courtier Fulke Greville, the Irish rebel William Nugent, the poet Aemelia Lanier (of Jewish descent and thought by some to be the unnamed Dark Lady of the Sonnets), and the Elizabethan diplomat Henry Neville. New candidates will almost surely be proposed in years to come. While the chapters that follow focus on Francis Bacon and the Earl of Oxford&#x2014;whose candidacies are the best documented and most consequential&#x2014;it&#x2019;s not because I believe that their claims are necessarily stronger than any of these others. An exhaustive account of all the candidates, including those already advanced and those waiting in the wings, would be both tedious and futile, and for reasons that will soon become clear, Bacon and Oxford can be taken as representative. </p><p>Much of what has been written about the authorship of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays follows the contours of a detective story, which is not all that surprising, since the authorship question and the &#x201c;whodunit&#x201d; emerged at the same historical moment. Like all good detective fiction, the Shakespeare mystery can be solved only by determining what evidence is credible, retracing steps, and avoiding false leads. My own account in the pages that follow is no different. I&#x2019;ve spent the past twenty-five years researching and teaching Shakespeare&#x2019;s works at Columbia University. For some, that automatically disqualifies me from writing fairly about the controversy on the grounds that my professional investments are so great that I cannot be objective. There are a few who have gone so far as to hint at a conspiracy at work among Shakespeare professors and institutions, with scholars paid off to suppress information that would undermine Shakespeare&#x2019;s claim. If so, somebody forgot to put my name on the list. </p><p>My graduate school experience taught me to be skeptical of unexamined historical claims, even ones that other Shakespeareans took on faith. I had wanted to write my doctoral dissertation on &#x201c;Shakespeare and the Jews&#x201d; but was told that since there were no Jews in Shakespeare&#x2019;s England there were no Jewish questions, and I should turn my attention elsewhere. I reluctantly did so, but years later, after a good deal of research, I learned that both claims were false: there was in fact a small community of Jews living in Elizabethan London, and many leading English writers at that time wrestled in their work with questions of Jewish difference (in an effort to better grasp what constituted English identity). That experience, and the book that grew out of it, taught me the value of revisiting truths universally acknowledged. </p><p>There yet remains one subject walled off from serious study by Shakespeare scholars: the authorship question. More than one fellow Shakespearean was disheartened to learn that I was committing my energies to it, as if somehow I was wasting my time and talent, or worse, at risk of going over to the dark side. I became increasingly interested in why this subject remains virtually taboo in academic circles, as well as in the consequences of this collective silence. One thing is certain: the decision by professors to all but ignore the authorship question hasn&#x2019;t made it disappear. If anything, more people are drawn to it than ever. And because prominent Shakespeareans&#x2014;with the notable exceptions of Samuel Schoenbaum, Jonathan Bate, Marjorie Garber, Gary Taylor, Stanley Wells, and Alan Nelson&#x2014;have all but surrendered the field, general readers curious about the subject typically learn about it through the books and websites of those convinced that Shakespeare could never have written the plays. </p><p>This was forcefully brought home not long ago when I met with a group of nine-year-olds at a local elementary school to talk about Shakespeare&#x2019;s poetry. When toward the end of the class I invited questions, a quiet boy on my left raised his hand and said: &#x201c;My brother told me that Shakespeare really didn&#x2019;t write <i>Romeo and Juliet</i>. Is that true?&#x201d; It was the kind of question I was used to hearing from undergraduates on the first day of a Shakespeare course or from audience members at popular lectures, but I hadn&#x2019;t expected that doubts about Shakespeare&#x2019;s authorship had filtered down to the fourth grade. </p><p>Not long after, at the Bank Street Bookstore, the best children&#x2019;s bookstore in New York City, I ran into a colleague from the history department buying a stack of books for her twelve-year-old daughter. On the top of her pile was a young adult paperback by Elise Broach, <i>Shakespeare&#x2019;s Secret,</i> which I learned from those who worked at the store was a popular title. I bought a copy. It&#x2019;s a fascinating and fast-paced detective story about a diamond necklace that once belonged to Queen Elizabeth. The mystery of the necklace is worked out only when another mystery, concerning who wrote Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays, is solved. </p><p>The father of the story&#x2019;s young heroine is a Shakespeare scholar at the &#x201c;Maxwell Elizabethan Documents Collection in Washington, D.C.&#x201d; (whose &#x201c;vaulted ceilings&#x201d; and &#x201c;long, shining wood tables&#x201d; bear a striking resemblance to those of the Folger Shakespeare Library). He tells his curious daughter that there&#x2019;s &#x201c;no proof, of course, but there are some intriguing clues&#x201d; that &#x201c;Edward de Vere, the seventeenth Earl of Oxford&#x201d; was &#x201c;the man who might be Shakespeare.&#x201d; When she asks him why people think Oxford might have written the plays, he explains that Oxford had &#x201c;the perfect background, really. He was clever, well educated, well traveled,&#x201d; and &#x201c;events of his life bear a fascinating resemblance to events in Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays.&#x201d; He adds that &#x201c;most academics still favor Shakespeare,&#x201d; though &#x201c;over the years, Oxford has emerged as a real possibility.&#x201d; But it doesn&#x2019;t take her long to suspect that Shakespeare wasn&#x2019;t the author after all; by page 45, after learning that Shakespeare &#x201c;couldn&#x2019;t even spell his own name,&#x201d; she decides: &#x201c;Okay, so maybe he didn&#x2019;t write the plays.&#x201d; </p><p>An unusual twist to the story is the suggestion that Queen Elizabeth and the Earl of Oxford had a clandestine relationship, which explains why Oxford couldn&#x2019;t claim credit for writing the plays falsely attributed to S...</p></p><h2>Shadow and Evil in Fairy Tales</h2><p>Fairy tales seem to be innocent stories, yet they contain profound lessons for those who would dive deep into their waters of meaning. In this book, Marie-Louise von Franz uncovers some of the important lessons concealed in tales from around the world, drawing on the wealth of her knowledge of folklore, her experience as a psychoanalyst and a collaborator with Jung, and her great personal wisdom. Among the many topics discussed in relation to the dark side of life and human psychology, both individual and collective, are: <br> <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;��&nbsp; How different aspects of the "shadow"� all the affects and attitudes that are unconscious to the ego personality� are personified in the giants and monsters, ghosts, and demons, evil kings and wicked witches of fairy tales <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;��&nbsp; How problems of the shadow manifest differently in men and women <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;��&nbsp; What fairy tales say about the kinds of behavior and attitudes that invite evil <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;��&nbsp; How Jung's technique of Active imagination can be used to overcome overwhelming negative emotions <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;��&nbsp; How ghost stories and superstitions reflect the psychology of grieving <br>�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;��&nbsp; What fairy tales advise us about whether to struggle against evil or turn the other cheek<br>Dr. von Franz concludes that ever rule of behavior that we can learn from the unconscious through fairy tales and dreams is usually a paradox: sometimes there must be a physical struggle against evil and sometimes a contest of wits, sometimes a display of strength or magic and sometimes a retreat. Above all, she shows the importance of relying on the central, authentic core of our being� the innermost Self, which is beyond the struggle between the opposites of good and evil.</p><p>Marie-Louise von Franz (1915&#x2013;1998) was the foremost student of C. G. Jung, with whom she worked closely from 1934 until his death in 1961. A founder of the C. G. Jung Institute of Zurich, she published widely on subjects including alchemy, dreams, fairy tales, personality types, and psychotherapy.</p><h2>Genesis to Deuteronomy: Notes on the Pentateuch</h2><p>For more than one hundred years, pastors, teachers, and students of the Bible have benefited from Mackintosh&#39;s deeply devotional commentary on the first five books of the Bible. His reflections are borne out of prolonged reflection and pastoral sensitivity-not abstruse theological concepts or an abstract engagement of the text. Mackintosh coaxingly invites readers to place themselves within the stories of the Pentateuch and confront the issues faced by the characters-to walk the garden with Adam and Eve, to connive with Jacob, to travel with Joseph, and to wander with the Israelites from the bondage of Egypt to the freedom of the Promised Land. The Pentateuch expresses the most basic human sentiments, and exposes the tension between promises and fulfillment, good and evil, belief and deception. Mackintosh&#39;s Notes on the Pentateuch shows how these books lay the groundwork for God&#39;s redemptive history. Charles Henry Mackintosh (1820-1896) was notable for his work in philanthropic work during the Irish Potatoe Famine which affected much of Ireland, Scotland, and England at the time. He converted to Christianity through correspondence with his sister and through reading John Darby&#39;s Operations of the Spirit.</p><p></p><h2>The Lutece Cookbook</h2><p>Here is the long-awaited cookbook from Andre Soltner, for decades the chef-proprietor of Lutece, New York&#x2019;s most famous restaurant. Here is a record of all the wondrous dishes with which he dazzled his faithful customers for more than thirty years &#x2013; 333 recipes, carefully worked out, brought together for the first time.</p><p>recipes, with illustrations by Henry Kibel.Soltner was the chef at New York City's four-star Lutece for more than 30 years. Although he sold the restaurant this year, few people could imagine it without him, for Soltner, with his wife, really made Lutece, and, as he says, it was his life. Devotees will be especially glad to have this cookbook. It is really a recipe book and Soltner's autobiography in one, a record of how real French food and dining were introduced in the United States. Lutece is known for perfect renditions of classic dishes, and they are all here, with newer ones as well. Many of the recipes are neither everyday fare nor the type of food most people would cook today, but this is both a history of a much-loved institution and a cookbook, to read as much as to cook from.

In 1819, the Essex left Nantucket for the South Pacific with twenty crew members aboard. In the middle of the South Pacific the ship was rammed and sunk by an angry sperm whale. The crew drifted for more than ninety days in three tiny whaleboats, succumbing to weather, hunger, disease, and ultimately turning to drastic measures in the fight for survival. Nathaniel Philbrick uses little-known documents-including a long-lost account written by the ship's cabin boy-and penetrating details about whaling and the Nantucket community to reveal the chilling events surrounding this epic maritime disaster. An intense and mesmerizing read, <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is a monumental work of history forever placing the Essex tragedy in the American historical canon.</p><p>The appeal of Dava Sobel's <i>Longitude</i> was, in part, that it illuminated a little-known piece of history through a series of captivating incidents and engaging personalities. Nathaniel Philbrick's <i>In the Heart of the Sea</i> is certainly cast from the same mold, examining the 19th-century Pacific whaling industry through the arc of the sinking of the whaleship <i>Essex</i> by a boisterous sperm whale. The story that inspired Herman Melville's classic <i>Moby-Dick</i> has a lot going for it--derring-do, cannibalism, rescue--and Philbrick proves an amiable and well-informed narrator, providing both context and detail. We learn about the importance and mechanics of blubber production--a vital source of oil--and we get the nuts and bolts of harpooning and life aboard whalers. We are spared neither the nitty-gritty of open boats nor the sucking of human bones dry.<p> By sticking to the tried and tested <i>Longitude</i> formula, Philbrick has missed a slight trick or two. The epicenter of the whaling industry was Nantucket, a small island off Cape Cod; most of the whales were in the Pacific, necessitating a huge journey around the southernmost tip of South America. We never learn why no one ever tried to create an alternative whaling capital somewhere nearer. Similarly, Philbrick tells us that the story of the <i>Essex</i> was well known to Americans for decades, but he never explores how such legends fade from our consciousness. Philbrick would no doubt reply that such questions were beyond his remit, and you can't exactly accuse him of skimping on his research. By any standard, 50 pages of footnotes impress, though he wears his learning lightly. He doesn't get bogged down in turgid detail, and his narrative rattles along at a nice pace. When the storyline is as good as this, you can't really ask for more. <i>--John Crace, Amazon.co.uk</i></p>7 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Parables and Paradoxes (Bilingual Edition) (English and German Edition)</h2><p>A bilingual collection of parables and paradoxes taken from Kafka&#39;s novels, short stories, and letters</p><p></p><h2>Secret Food Cures</h2><p>From the famed researchers seen on CBS This Morning and NBC&#39;s Today Show, Joan Wilen and Lydia Wilen!

They mean only one thing: that his neck is on the line too. So when they are uttered by his lowlife cousin Ulysses S. Grant, Paris keeps the door firmly closed. With family like Ulysses-Useless to everyone except his mother-who needs enemies?But trouble always finds an open window, and when Useless&#39;s mother, Three Hearts, shows up from Louisiana to look for her son, Paris has no choice but to track down his wayward cousin.Finding a con artist like Useless is easier said than done. But with the aid of his ear-to-the-ground friend Fearless Jones, Paris gets a hint that Useless may have expanded his range of enterprise to include blackmail. Now he has disappeared, and Paris&#39;s mission is to discover whether he is hiding from his vengeful victims-or already dead.Traversing the complicated landscape of 1950s Los Angeles, where a wrong look can get a black man killed, Paris and Fearless find desperate women, secret lives, and more than one dead body along the way. Fear of the Dark is filled with the sheer-nerve plotting and brilliant characterizations that prompted The Nation to credit Walter Mosley for &#34;the finest detective oeuvre in American literature.&#34;</p><p>Walter Mosley is the author of the Easy Rawlins and Fearless Jones mysteries, the novels Blue Light, and RL&#39;s Dream, and two collections of stories, Always Outnumbered, Always Outgunned, for which he received the Anisfield-Wold Award, and Walkin&#39; the Dog. He was born in Los Angeles and lives in New York.Michael Boatman transports listeners to 1950s Los Angeles in Mosley's latest Fearless Jones mystery. Erudite Paris Minton--who is anything but "some negro bookseller"--is the perfect foil for Jones since he is as cowardly as the former Army assassin is fearless. As Boatman unfolds the trail of murder, blackmail, and theft, the nature of villains, racists, an evil-eyed mother, and grieving hit men, among other characters, are all hauntingly, sharply, even elegantly unveiled. An undercurrent of racism can be heard in the voices of cops, blackmailed businessmen, and Asian citizens recovering from the impact of war. Haunting period melodies mark chapter closings, reminiscent of a classic radio serial.

She was at one time the most powerful woman in the British Empire: a nation builder, the driving force behind the creation of modern-day Iraq. Born in 1868 into a world of privilege, Bell turned her back on Victorian society, choosing to read history at Oxford and going on to become an archaeologist, spy, Arabist, linguist, author (of <i>Persian Pictures</i>, <i>The Desert and the Sown</i>, and many other collections), poet, photographer, and legendary mountaineer (she took off her skirt and climbed the Alps in her underclothes).<br><br>She traveled the globe several times, but her passion was the desert, where she traveled with only her guns and her servants. Her vast knowledge of the region made her indispensable to the Cairo Intelligence Office of the British government during World War I. She advised the Viceroy of India; then, as an army major, she traveled to the front lines in Mesopotamia. There, she supported the creation of an autonomous Arab nation for Iraq, promoting and manipulating the election of King Faisal to the throne and helping to draw the borders of the fledgling state. <i>Gertrude Bell</i>, vividly told and impeccably researched by Georgina Howell, is a richly compelling portrait of a woman who transcended the restrictions of her class and times, and in so doing, created a remarkable and enduring legacy.</p><p>Georgina Howell&nbsp;has worked in magazine journalism since the age of seventeen. She has written for <i>Vanity Fair </i>and American <i>Vogue, </i>and has worked at <i>The Observer</i>, British <i>Vogue</i>, <i>The Tatler</i>, and <i>The Sunday Times. </i>She lives in London and Brittany.Chapter One&nbsp;GERTRUDE AND FLORENCE&nbsp;mmm&nbsp;&nbsp;It is 22 March 1921, the last day of the Cairo Conference and the final opportunity for the British to determine the postwar future of the Middle East. Like any tourists, the delegation make the routine tour of the pyramids and have themselves photographed on camels in front of the Sphinx. Standing beneath its half-effaced head, two of the most famous Englishmen of the twentieth century confront the camera in some disarray: Colonial Secretary Winston Churchill, who has just, to the amusement of all, fallen off his camel, and T. E. Lawrence, tightly constrained in the pin-striped suit and trilby of a senior civil servant. Between them, at her ease, rides Gertrude Bell, the sole delegate possessing knowledge indispensable to the Conference. Her face, in so far as it can be seen beneath the brim of her rose-decorated straw hat, is transfigured with happiness. Her dream of an independent Arab nation is about to come true, her choice of a king endorsed: her Iraq is about to become a country. Just before leaving the Semiramis Hotel that morning, Churchill has cabled to London the vital message "Sharif's son Faisal offers hope of best and cheapest solution."&nbsp;By what evolution did a female descendant of Cumbrian sheep farmers become, in her time, the most influential figure in the Middle East? She was as English as English can be, which is to say that she was bred in the wuthering heights of Yorkshire. These northern farmers have acquired a very particular character ever since the eleventh century, when, alone among the English, they refused to submit to William the Conqueror. Physically and mentally tough, they are given to few words, unvarnished and bluntly delivered.&nbsp;Gertrude Bell's great-great-grandfather was a Carlisle blacksmith, and her great-grandfather began the first alkali factory and iron foundry at Jarrow. Her famous and powerful grandfather Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell, born in 1816, was a metallurgical chemist and perhaps the country's foremost industrialist. Manufacturing steel on a huge scale, he produced one-third of the metal used in Britain and much of that used for railtrack and bridge construction in the rapidly developing Empire. He became a Fellow of the Royal Society, Britain's most distinguished scientific institution. Educated first as an engineer, he studied at Edinburgh University and at the Sorbonne in Paris, then in Denmark and the south of France. Author of The Chemical Phenomena of Iron Smelting, he was looked upon as the "high priest of British Metallurgy" and he was the first to identify the value of phosphorus fertiliser as a by-product of steel-making. Referred to as "Sir Isaac" or more familiarly as "Lowthian," in 1854 &nbsp;he was elected Lord Mayor of Newcastle upon Tyne, then later be-&nbsp;came Liberal Member of Parliament for Hartlepool and High Sheriff &nbsp;of County Durham. He was a contemporary and friend of Charles &nbsp;Darwin, Thomas Huxley, William Morris, and John Ruskin, men to whom can be attributed seminal advances in evolution and science, art, architecture, and social reform. Lowthian was president or vice-president of eight national engineering and chemical institutions, several of &nbsp;which he had founded. He was also the director of the North Eastern Railway.&nbsp;With Lowthian's two brothers John and Tom, Bell Brothers owned collieries, quarries, and iron ore mines; factories and foundries whose furnaces, burning twenty-four hours a day, regularly reddened the night skies. His company and its associates employed more than forty-seven thousand men, and the family boast was that they would make anything "from a needle to a ship." Besides the first iron and steel works in Newcastle, and the second at Port Clarence in Middlesbrough, he set up a chemical plant for the country's first manufacture of aluminium--until then, a metal as valuable as gold. On the factory's opening day, he was driven in his carriage through the streets of Newcastle in an aluminium top hat, which he doffed to the crowd. He was the first British ironmaster to own a machine for making steel rope.&nbsp;Lowthian wrote several scientific books, but his most remarkable was a comprehensive and logical assessment of Britain's prospects for competing with the world in steel production. He invested heavily in research into the process of steel-making, and was determined to push Britain into developing new technological industries. In the hope that all of British industry would follow his example, he advocated government support for scientific research and technical development. But in this, &nbsp;after a lifetime's work, he failed. As he had forecast, other countries--and particularly Germany with its Krupps armaments and Thyssen steel--grew in technical competence and productivity, outstripping Britain and building the wealth and power they were to wield in the &nbsp;First World War.&nbsp;A formidable giant of a man, a paterfamilias who would have almost sixty grandchildren--the number is disputed--Lowthian and his wife, Margaret Pattinson, set a pattern for the Bells of comfortable rather than lavish lifestyle. Considering the huge scale of his enterprises, and his position as the Bill Gates of his day, he did not live extravagantly. This may have had something to do with Margaret's influence: she came from a family of shopkeepers and scientists. His first house, Washington New Hall--four miles south of Newcastle upon Tyne, a stone's throw from the home of the ancestors of George Washington--was not quite a mansion, and the house he built at the zenith of his power, Rounton Grange, was not quite a stately home. He toyed with Gothic, but settled for William Morris's humbler Arts and Crafts style, with its emphasis on traditional artisan skills as a panacea for the ravages wreaked by the Industrial Revolution. This would remain the characteristic style of the Bells' private houses and public buildings. Unlike many heirs to great fortunes, Lowthian's elder son Hugh, Gertrude's father, also lived modestly for a captain of industry. His own first house, Red Barns, at the fishing village of Redcar on the Yorkshire coast, a short train journey from Clarence, reflected this. After Lowthian's death, the house he owned in London was sold, the money presumably divided between Hugh and his siblings--Charles, Ada, Maisie, and Florence.&nbsp;Lowthian was admired rather than loved, and appears to have been dictatorial and harsh towards his family. Gertrude and her sisters and brothers addressed him as "Pater." An illustrated family alphabet they drew up for Christmas at Rounton in 1877, when Gertrude was nine, reflects the feelings of the children towards their abrasive grandfather.&nbsp;A for us All come to spend Christmas week&nbsp;B for our Breathless endeavours to speak&nbsp;C is the Crushing Contemptuous Pater . . .&nbsp;Elsa, Gertrude's younger half-sister, has added: "Sir Isaac Lowthian Bell" in pencil, lest it be thought that this description referred to the gentler and kindlier Hugh.&nbsp;A family story suggests the awe with which "Pater" was regarded by the Bells. Lowthian forbade anyone to use his horses. When one of his granddaughters fainted one evening at dinner from a riding injury (a broken collarbone), everyone conspired to hide the truth: she had borrowed one of his horses and gone hunting with the gentry. The children's grandmother Margaret could be as scathing as Lowthian. A teatime visitor once said to her hostess: "Your scones are lovely." "So I see," retorted the old lady. "Your hand has not been out of the dish since you arrived."&nbsp;Some previously unknown stories about Lowthian emerged recently from papers found in one of the Bell houses, Mount Grace Priory, the ruined medieval abbey where Gertrude's father and stepmother ended their days. English Heritage was renovating the house before opening it to the public when they found the papers hidden under the floorboards. Among them is a reference to a tragic event at Washington New Hall, where "in 1872 a seven-year-old sweep was suffocated in the Hall chimney." If the little boy met his end in Lowthian's chimney in 1872, the ironmaster had comprehensively broken the law. Parliament had forbidden the use of children as chimney-sweeps a full twenty-six years earlier. Sir Isaac may have known nothing about the presence of the chimney-sweep until it was too late; however, whether because he was deeply upset or because he wanted to escape a damaging association, he moved into the newly built Rounton Grange as soon as possible, and let Washington New Hall stand empty and unsold. Nineteen years later, he gave it away as a home for waifs and strays, on condition it was renamed "Dame Margaret's Hall"; today, it is divided into pleasant apartments. Not perhaps unconnected with this story is the fact that many years later Hugh Bell successfully lobbied for a parliamentary bill to protect children from dangerous work. (In the 1860s, the Earl of Shaftesbury &nbsp;reported that children of four and five were still working in certain factories from six in the morning until ten at night.)&nbsp;The papers found under the boards also contained the sentence, "On one winter's night [Sir Isaac] came out of the Hall to find his coachman frozen stiff on the box-seat of his carriage." The facts remain mysterious. The unfortunate coachman may have had a heart attack rather than dying of exposure, and yet it emerges clearly that consideration for others was not, perhaps, Lowthian's principal quality.&nbsp;The author of these papers, which contain many confirmable facts about Lowthian's life and work, may have been Miss K. E. M. Cooper Abbs, a Bell relation who was the last tenant to live at Mount Grace. If she was moved to record Lowthian's life, it may be because she was incensed that, whether by accident or intent, so many family papers and archives were burnt by members of the family after his death. There is to this day no biography of the man who was as famous in his day as Isambard Kingdom Brunel.&nbsp;A more lovable, more charming man, Gertrude's father, Sir Hugh, led the Bell industries and inherited a vast fortune. Like his father, he was educated in Edinburgh, at the Sorbonne, and in Germany, where he studied mathematics and organic chemistry. He began work at eighteen at the Bell Brothers Ironworks in Newcastle, became director of the growing Port Clarence steelworks that dominated the grimy roofscape of Middlesbrough, and eventually ran the entire business and all its ramifications. He dug the ironstone from the Cleveland hills, worked the coal from Durham, brought the limestone from the backbone of England, lived on the Tees, and was a director of the North Eastern Railway, which brought the raw material to the steel foundry. His public works were second to none, especially after his second marriage to Florence Olliffe. He built schools and founded libraries, constructed meeting houses and workers' terraces, made a community centre for staff and labourers at Rounton and paid for a holiday home for worthy families needing a country break from life at the works. He also constructed the famous Transporter Bridge, which is still used to ferry workers and tourists quickly and cheaply over the River Tees. In 1906 he became Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding, welcoming royalty and other VIPs whenever they ventured into the windswept Yorkshire landscape, and was three times elected Mayor of Middlesbrough.&nbsp;In supplying the Empire, the Bells brought a global view to British industry. Sir Hugh was an accomplished public speaker, delivering persuasive messages on such subjects as free trade, which he passionately endorsed, and home rule for the Irish, which he passionately opposed. You can hear in his published speeches the vigour and humour with which he captivated audiences of all types and classes. In his words:&nbsp;Free Trade is like the quality of mercy: it is twice blessed, for it blesses him that gives and him that takes, and I for one will do nothing to place any restriction upon it. The Free market is the greatest safeguard we have against the tyranny of wealth. I look forward with dread to the accumulation of great fortunes in single hands . . . There are millions of persons in this country depending upon weekly wages, upon work which may be discontinued at the end of any week. It is with them I am concerned, and about them that I am perturbed, and not about the class to which I belong.&nbsp;He welcomed the rise of the new trade unions, while warning that the writings of Karl Marx could lead socialists into revolutionary movements that would destroy British industry and employment in the competitive world that he endorsed.&nbsp;When Gertrude was born, Queen Victoria had been on the throne for thirty years. She was driven by Prince Albert's relentless determination to replace the louche self-indulgence of Georgian Britain with Victorian industry and propriety. Britain, and particularly England, led the world in technical superiority--as evinced in that paeon to the Empire, the Great Exhibition at the Crystal Palace in 1851. The British army, able to call on troops from around the world, represented what was probably the greatest military power of all time; the British navy held control of the oceans and the trade across them, and kept the peace. If those other empires, the Russian and the Ottoman, were still in a state of feudal serfdom and of institutionalized corruption at every level, the British example, inspired by Victoria and Albert, brought at least a concern for moderation, philanthropy, and honest dealing. By the mid-nineteenth century, the concept of Empire was evolving from one of commercial exploitation to one capable of taking a pride in honest and benevolent government. Commercially aggressive but socially responsible, the Bells personified the new mood, and they enjoyed all the confidence of the right people in the right place at the right time.&nbsp;Hugh married Mary Shield when he was twenty-three, choosing a local girl who was the daughter of a prominent merchant of Newcastle upon Tyne. They were married on the Scottish island of Bute on the Clyde, where the Shields kept a holiday home. Their first child, Gertrude, was born in 1868 at Washington New Hall, the home of Hugh's father. Family life centred on this larger-than-life industrialist who had made the Bells the sixth-richest family in England. He could not have been easy to live with, nor the house peaceful, and there are many intimations of his bombastic temperament and caustic wit. Although Hugh, his elder son, had an inclination for the political life, he had had it made brutally clear to him that his future lay in Middlesbrough, with the fastest-growing part of the iron business. Lowthian, based at the original works in Newcastle, would descend on the new Port Clarence steelworks at irregular intervals, to scrutinize and doubtless criticize every aspect of Hugh's work.&nbsp;It would have been with great relief that Hugh and Mary moved with their two-year-old daughter out of Washington New Hall for a quieter domestic life of their own. It was not to last long. Beautiful but delicate, Mary survived only three weeks after the birth of their second child, Maurice, in 1871.&nbsp;Hugh became for a time a poignant figure.

Bliss." - Holland Cotter, <i>The</i> <i>New York Times</i> 2013 holiday gift list</p><b>Library Journal<br><br></b><p>Although more than 20 million Americans have practiced yoga at some point in their lives, many are not aware of the length and breadth of the yoga tradition. Diamond (South &amp; Southeast Asian Art, Sackler Gallery; Garden and Cosmos: Royal Painting of Jodhpur) explores the diversity of the yoga tradition through its visual culture. The title is a play on words, as the word &#x201c;transformation&#x201d; not only speaks of yoga&#x2019;s power to transform individuals but of how yoga itself has transformed over millennia. Diamond organized a show of the same name at Washington, DC&#x2019;s Arthur M. Sackler Gallery, the first ever art exhibition covering the visual culture of yoga. Seven contributors&#x2019; essays explore the history and evolution of the practice from ancient through modern times and across cultures. They reveal that yoga is not the property of any one religion or culture but has been adapted again and again to meet the needs of its practitioners. Themed catalog entries provide further analysis of the beautiful full-color reproductions of the exhibition&#x2019;s artwork. VERDICT Appropriate for students and scholars of both art history and yoga; however, prior knowledge of related philosophy and Indian history is necessary to fully comprehend the text.&nbsp; &#x2014;Julia A. Watson, Marywood Univ. Lib., Scranton, PA<br><br><b>Choice<br><br></b>Far more than an exhibition catalogue, this work by Diamond (Sackler Gallery, Smithsonian) et al. is an indispensable resource for the study of Yoga, Indian religions more generally, and Indian art. It is likewise a trove for the study of embodied religion. The curated images visually demonstrate the development and changing construct of Yoga in works dating from 1900 BCE to the present, including sculpture, painting, and photography. The images are successfully elucidated by the accompanying text. The nine essays are all worthy contributions to scholarly discourse--insightful enough to be worthwhile to specialists, yet accessible, in their language and presentation, to nonspecialists. Although the emphasis is on Hindu forms of Yoga, the Jain, Buddhist, Sikh, and Muslim forms of Yoga are also addressed. Furthermore, the essays and pictorial selections excel at demonstrating the interplay between the transgressive aspects of Yoga and the adaptation and adoption of Yoga by mainstream cultures. Perhaps more than anything, however, this work is invaluable because of the quality of the images. In many cases, the originals are so small that they cannot be adequately studied without significant magnification. This book presents them in stunning reproductions in forms where the details can be appreciated. Summing Up: Essential.

Here, in this straightforward, thoughtful, and thought-provoking book, she sets out a program that can lead us toward a more compassionate life.<br><br>The twelve steps Armstrong suggests begin with &#x201c;Learn About Compassion&#x201d; and close with &#x201c;Love Your Enemies.&#x201d; In between, she takes up &#x201c;compassion for yourself,&#x201d; mindfulness, suffering, sympathetic joy, the limits of our knowledge of others, and &#x201c;concern for everybody.&#x201d; She suggests concrete ways of enhancing our compassion and putting it into action in our everyday lives, and provides, as well, a reading list to encourage us to &#x201c;hear one another&#x2019;s narratives.&#x201d; Throughout, Armstrong makes clear that a compassionate life is not a matter of only heart or mind but a deliberate and often life-altering commingling of the two.</p><p>Karen Armstrong is the author of numerous other books on religious affairs. In February 2008 she was awarded the TED Prize and began working on the Charter for Compassion, created online by the general public and crafted by leading thinkers in Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, and Buddhism. The charter was signed in November 2009 by a thousand religious and secular leaders. She lives in London.Preface<br><br><i>Wish for a Better World<br></i><br>In November 2007, I heard that I had won a prize. Each year TED (the acronym for Technology, Entertainment, Design), a private nonprofit organization best known for its superb conferences on &#x201c;ideas worth spreading,&#x201d; gives awards to people whom they think have made a difference but who, with their help, could make even more of an impact. Other winners have included former U.S. president Bill Clinton, the scientist E. O. Wilson, and the British chef Jamie Oliver. The recipient is given $100,000 but, more important, is granted a wish for a better world. I knew immediately what I wanted. One of the chief tasks of our time must surely be to build a global community in which all peoples can live together in mutual respect; yet religion, which should be making a major contribution, is seen as part of the problem. All faiths insist that compassion is the test of true spirituality and that it brings us into relation with the transcendence we call God, Brahman, Nirvana, or Dao. Each has formulated its own version of what is sometimes called the Golden Rule, &#x201c;Do not treat others as you would not like them to treat you,&#x201d; or in its positive form, &#x201c;Always treat others as you would wish to be treated yourself.&#x201d; Further, they all insist that you cannot confine your benevolence to your own group; you must have concern for everybody&#x2014;even your enemies.<br><br>Yet sadly we hear little about compassion these days. I have lost count of the number of times I have jumped into a London taxi and, when the cabbie asks how I make a living, have been informed categorically that religion has been the cause of all the major wars in history. In fact, the causes of conflict are usually greed, envy, and ambition, but in an effort to sanitize them, these self-serving emotions have often been cloaked in religious rhetoric. There has been much flagrant abuse of religion in recent years. Terrorists have used their faith to justify atrocities that violate its most sacred values. In the Roman Catholic Church, popes and bishops have ignored the suffering of countless women and children by turning a blind eye to the sexual abuse committed by their priests. Some religious leaders seem to behave like secular politicians, singing the praises of their own denomination and decrying their rivals with scant regard for charity. In their public pronouncements, they rarely speak of compassion but focus instead on such secondary matters as sexual practices, the ordination of women, or abstruse doctrinal formulations, implying that a correct stance on these issues&#x2014;rather than the Golden Rule&#x2014;is the criterion of true faith.<br><br>Yet it is hard to think of a time when the compassionate voice of religion has been so sorely needed. Our world is dangerously polarized. There is a worrying imbalance of power and wealth and, as a result, a growing rage, malaise, alienation, and humiliation that has erupted in terrorist atrocities that endanger us all. We are engaged in wars that we seem unable either to end or to win. Disputes that were secular in origin, such as the Arab-Israeli conflict, have been allowed to fester and become &#x201c;holy,&#x201d; and once they have been sacralized, positions tend to harden and become resistant to pragmatic solutions. And yet at the same time we are bound together more closely than ever before through the electronic media. Suffering and want are no longer confined to distant, disadvantaged parts of the globe. When stocks plummet in one country, there is a domino effect in markets all around the world. What happens today in Gaza or Afghanistan is now likely to have repercussions tomorrow in London or New York. We all face the terrifying possibility of environmental catastrophe. In a world in which small groups will increasingly have powers of destruction hitherto confined to the nation-state, it has become imperative to apply the Golden Rule globally, ensuring that all peoples are treated as we would wish to be treated ourselves. If our religious and ethical traditions fail to address this challenge, they will fail the test of our time.<br><br>So at the award ceremony in February 2008, I asked TED to help me create, launch, and propagate a Charter for Compassion that would be written by leading thinkers from a variety of major faiths and would restore compassion to the heart of religious and moral life. The charter would counter the voices of extremism, intolerance, and hatred. At a time when religions are widely assumed to be at loggerheads, it would also show that, despite our significant differences, on this we are all in agreement and that it is indeed possible for the religious to reach across the divide and work together for justice and peace.<br><br>Thousands of people from all over the world contributed to a draft charter on a multilingual website in Hebrew, Arabic, Urdu, Spanish, and English; their comments were presented to the Council of Conscience, a group of notable individuals from six faith traditions (Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism), who met in Switzerland in February 2009 to compose the final version:<br><br>"The principle of compassion lies at the heart of all religious, ethical and spiritual traditions, calling us always to treat all others as we wish to be treated ourselves.<br><br>Compassion impels us to work tirelessly to alleviate the suffering of our fellow creatures, to dethrone ourselves from the centre of our world and put another there, and to honour the inviolable sanctity of every single human being, treating everybody, without exception, with absolute justice, equity and respect.<br><br>It is also necessary in both public and private life to refrain consistently and empathically from inflicting pain. To act or speak violently out of spite, chauvinism or self-interest, to impoverish, exploit or deny basic rights to anybody, and to incite hatred by denigrating others&#x2014;even our enemies&#x2014;is a denial of our common humanity. We acknowledge that we have failed to live compassionately and that some have even increased the sum of human misery in the name of religion.<br><br>We therefore call upon all men and women<br><br>�&nbsp;to restore compassion to the centre of morality and religion;<br><br>�&nbsp;to return to the ancient principle that any interpretation of scripture that breeds violence, hatred or disdain is illegitimate;<br><br>�&nbsp;to ensure that youth are given accurate and respectful information about other traditions, religions and cultures;<br><br>�&nbsp;to encourage a positive appreciation of cultural and religious diversity;<br><br>�&nbsp;to cultivate an informed empathy with the suffering of all human beings&#x2014;even those regarded as enemies.<br><br>We urgently need to make compassion a clear, luminous and dynamic force in our polarized world. Rooted in a principled determination to transcend selfishness, compassion can break down political, dogmatic, ideological and religious boundaries. Born of our deep interdependence, compassion is essential to human relationships and to a fulfilled humanity. It is the path to enlightenment, and indispensible to the creation of a just economy and a peaceful global community."<br><br>The charter was launched on November 12, 2009, in sixty different locations throughout the world; it was enshrined in synagogues, mosques, temples, and churches as well as in such secular institutions as the Karachi Press Club and the Sydney Opera House. But the work is only just beginning. At this writing, we have more than 150 partners working together throughout the globe to translate the charter into practical, realistic action.<br><br>But can compassion heal the seemingly intractable problems of our time? Is this virtue even feasible in the technological age? And what does &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; actually mean? Our English word is often confused with &#x201c;pity&#x201d; and associated with an uncritical, sentimental benevolence: the <i>Oxford English Dictionary</i>, for example, defines &#x201c;compassionate&#x201d; as &#x201c;piteous&#x201d; or &#x201c;pitiable.&#x201d; This perception of compassion is not only widespread but ingrained. When I gave a lecture in the Netherlands recently, I emphatically made the point that compassion did <i>not</i> mean feeling sorry for people, but the Dutch translation of my text in the newspaper <i>De Volkskrant</i> consistently rendered &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; as &#x201c;pity.&#x201d; But &#x201c;compassion&#x201d; derives from the Latin <i>patiri </i>and the Greek <i>pathein</i>, meaning &#x201c;to suffer, undergo, or experience.&#x201d; So &#x201c;<i>com</i>passion&#x201d; means &#x201c;to endure [something] <i>with</i> another person,&#x201d; to put ourselves in somebody else&#x2019;s shoes, to feel her pain as though it were our own, and to enter generously into his point of view. That is why compassion is aptly summed up in the Golden Rule, which asks us to look into our own hearts, discover what gives us pain, and then refuse, under any circumstance whatsoever, to inflict that pain on anybody else. Compassion can be defined, therefore, as an attitude of principled, consistent altruism.<br><br>The first person to formulate the Golden Rule, as far as we know, was the Chinese sage Confucius (551&#x2013;479 BCE), who when asked which of his teachings his disciples could practice &#x201c;all day and every day&#x201d; replied: &#x201c;Perhaps the saying about <i>shu</i> (&#x201c;consideration&#x201d;). Never do to others what you would not like them to do to you.&#x201d; This, he said, was the thread that ran right through the spiritual method he called the Way (<i>dao</i>) and pulled all its teachings together. &#x201c;Our Master&#x2019;s Way,&#x201d; explained one of his pupils, &#x201c;is nothing but this: doing-your-best-for-others (<i>zhong</i>) and consideration (<i>shu</i>).&#x201d; A better translation of <i>shu</i> is &#x201c;likening to oneself&#x201d;; people should not put themselves in a special, privileged category but relate their own experience to that of others &#x201c;all day and every day.&#x201d; Confucius called this ideal <i>ren</i>, a word that originally meant &#x201c;noble&#x201d; or &#x201c;worthy&#x201d; but which by his time simply meant &#x201c;human.&#x201d; Some scholars have argued that its root meaning was &#x201c;softness,&#x201d; &#x201c;pliability.&#x201d; But Confucius always refused to define <i>ren</i>, because, he said, it did not adequately correspond to any of the familiar categories of his day. It could be understood only by somebody who practiced it perfectly and was inconceivable to anybody who did not. A person who behaved with <i>ren</i> &#x201c;all day and every day&#x201d; would become a <i>junzi</i>, a &#x201c;mature human being.&#x201d;<br><br>Compassion, therefore, was inseparable from humanity; instead of being motivated by self-interest, a truly humane person was consistently oriented to others. The disciplined practice of <i>shu</i> took you into a dimension of experience that was transcendent because it went beyond the egotism that characterizes most human transactions. The Buddha (c. 470&#x2013;390 BCE) would have agreed. He claimed to have discovered a realm of sacred peace within himself that he called <i>nirvana</i> (&#x201c;blowing out&#x201d;), because the passions, desires, and selfishness that had hitherto held him in thrall had been extinguished like a flame. Nirvana, he claimed, was an entirely natural state and could be achieved by anybody who put his regimen into practice. One of its central disciplines was a meditation on four elements of the &#x201c;immeasurable&#x201d; love that exists within everyone and everything: <i>maitri</i> (&#x201c;loving kindness&#x201d;), the desire to bring happiness to all sentient beings; <i>karuna</i> (&#x201c;compassion&#x201d;), the resolve to liberate all creatures from their pain; <i>mudita</i> (&#x201c;sympathetic joy&#x201d;), which takes delight in the happiness of others; and finally <i>upeksha</i> (&#x201c;even-mindedness&#x201d;), an equanimity that enables us to love all beings equally and impartially.<br><br>These traditions, therefore, agree that compassion is natural to human beings, that it is the fulfillment of human nature, and that in calling us to set ego aside in a consistently empathetic consideration of others, it can introduce us to a dimension of existence that transcends our normal self-bound state. Later, as we shall see, the three monotheistic religions would arrive at similar conclusions, and the fact that this ideal surfaced in all these faiths independently suggests that it reflects something essential to the structure of our humanity.</p><h2>Lamplighter (Monster Blood Tattoo, Book 2)</h2><p>Continuing the absorbing, inventive saga started in <i>Foundling</i>, <i>Lamplighter</i> follows Rossam?nd Bookchild, now one of the Emperor�s lamplighters, who is sworn to protect travelers from the ferocious bogles that live in the wild. Small and meek, he does not fit in. Then a haughty young female monster hunter is forced upon the lamplighters for training. As Rossam?nd begins to make new friends in the dangerous world of the Half-Continent, he also seems to make more enemies, finding himself pushed toward a destiny that he could never have imagined. . . .</p><p>D.M. Cornish was born in time to see the first Star Wars movie. He was five. It made him realize that worlds beyond his own were possible, and he failed to eat his popcorn. Experiences with C.S. Lewis, and later J.R.R. Tolkien, completely convinced him that other worlds existed, and that writers had a key to these worlds. But words were not yet his earliest tools for storytelling. Drawings were.<p>He spent most of his childhood drawing, as well as most of his teenage and adult years as well. And by age eleven he had made his first book, called "Attack from Mars." It featured Jupitans and lots and lots of drawings of space battles. (It has never been published and world rights are still available.)</p><p>He studied illustration at the University of South Australia, where he began to compile a series of notebooks, beginning with #1 in 1993. He had read Mervyn Peake's Gormenghast novels, The Iliad, and Paul Gallico's Love of Seven Dolls. Classical ideas as well as the great desire to continue what Mervyn Peake had begun but not finished led him to delineate his own world. Hermann Hesse, Kafka and other writers convinced him there were ways to be fantastical without conforming to the generally accepted notions of fantasy. Over the next ten years he filled 23 journals with his pictures, definitions, ideas and histories of his world, the Half-Continent.</p><p>It was not until 2003 that a chance encounter with a children's publisher gave him an opportunity to develop these ideas further. Learning of his journals, she bullied him into writing a story from his world. Cornish was sent away with the task of delivering 1,000 words the following week and each week thereafter. Abandoning all other paid work, he spent the next two years propped up with one small advance after the other as his publisher tried desperately to keep him from eating his furniture. </p><p>And so Rossamund's story was born - a labor of love over twelve years in the making.</p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p><p></p>Grade 8 Up&#x2014;Rossam�nd Bookchild has begun his training as a lamplighter, lighting the highways of the Half-Continent and fending off the increasingly frequent attacks by the varied and dangerous monsters of the land. The militaristic lifestyle is rigorous and lonely. His only companion is a fellow outcast, a haughty aristocrat's daughter who is the only girl among the cadets. Rossam�nd's alienation grows with his increasing suspicion that not all "boggles" are evil&#x2014;a philosophy regarded as treasonous in his society. Both the story and the accompanying 90-page "Explicarium" build on and expand the information in <i>Foundling</i> (Putnam, 2006), and reading this book without a firm grounding in the first is not to be attempted. Cornish's rich supporting cast brings together some of the best characters of the previous installment (most notably the captivating, mercenary monster-slayer Europe) with a host of intriguing new personages, including a former lighter who is physically and mentally scarred from a monster attack, a sinister surgeon, and a horrible half-human half-monster construct. Devout fantasy fans will welcome the return to the socially and morally complex world of the Half-Continent and eagerly anticipate the concluding installment.&#x2014;<i>Christi Esterle, Parker Library, CO</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

McDermott lives with her family outside Washington, D.C.ONE <br>&nbsp; <br>&nbsp; <br>Pegeen Chehab walked up from the subway in the evening light. Her good spring coat was powder blue; her shoes were black and covered the insteps of her long feet. Her hat was beige with something dark along the crown, a brown feather or two. There was a certain asymmetry to her shoulders. She had a loping, hunchbacked walk. She had, always, a bit of black hair along her cheek, straggling to her shoulder, her bun coming undone. She carried her purse in the lightest clasp of her fingers, down along the side of her leg, which made her seem listless and weary even as she covered the distance quickly enough, the gray sidewalk from subway to parlor floor and basement of the house next door. <br>I was on the stoop of my own house, waiting for my father. Pegeen paused to say hello. <br>She was not a pretty girl particularly; there was a narrowness to her eyes and a wideness to her jaw, crooked teeth, wild eyebrows, and a faint mustache. She had her Syrian father&#x2019;s thick dark hair, but also the permanent scattered flush, just under the fair skin, of her Irish mother&#x2019;s broad cheeks. She had a job in lower Manhattan in this, her first year out of Manual Training, and, she said, she didn&#x2019;t like the people there. She didn&#x2019;t like a single one of them. She ran a bare hand along the stone balustrade above my head. The other, which lightly held the strap of her purse, wore a dove-gray glove. She&#x2019;d lost its partner somewhere, she said. And laughed with her crooked teeth. Fourth pair this month, she said. <br>And left the library book she was reading on the subway yesterday. <br>And look, tore her stocking on something. <br>She lifted her black shoe to the step where I sat and pulled back the long coat and the skirt. I saw the laddered run, the flesh of Pegeen&#x2019;s thin and dark-haired calf pressing through between each rung. The nail of the finger Pegeen ran over its length was bitten down to nothing, but the movement of her hand along the tear was gentle and conciliatory. A kind of sympathy for her own flesh, which I imitated, brushing my own hand along the unbroken silk of Pegeen&#x2019;s stocking, and then over the torn threads of the run. <br>&#x201c;Amadan,&#x201d; Pegeen said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s me. That&#x2019;s what I am.&#x201d; <br>She pulled the leg away. The skirt and the blue coat fell into place again. Across the back hem and up the left side of Pegeen&#x2019;s good spring coat there was a long smudge of soot that I impulsively reached out to brush away. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve got some dirt,&#x201d; I said. <br>Pegeen turned, twisted her chin around, arm and elbow raised, trying to see what she couldn&#x2019;t see because it was behind her. &#x201c;Where?&#x201d; she said. <br>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d; I batted at the dirt until Pegeen threw back her head in elaborate frustration, pulling the coat forward, winding it around her like a cloak. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll be happy,&#x201d; she said, slapping at her hip, &#x201c;to stop going to that filthy place.&#x201d; Meaning lower Manhattan, where she worked. <br>She paused, put her nose to the air in mock confidence. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get a boyfriend,&#x201d; she said. She batted her eyelashes and drew out a sly smile. They were great kidders, the Chehabs, and no boyfriends, it seemed, had yet called for Pegeen. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get myself married,&#x201d; she said, and then licked all at once the four tall fingers of the gloveless hand and swatted them against the dirty cloth. <br>&#x201c;Amadan,&#x201d; she said again. Which, she explained, was her mother&#x2019;s word for fool. <br>And then she released the skirt of her long coat and, dipping her shoulders, shook herself back into it again. She reminded me of a bird taking a sand bath. &#x201c;I fell down,&#x201d; she announced. She said it in the same fond and impatient tone she had used to describe the lost glove, the forgotten library book. &#x201c;On the subway.&#x201d; It was the tone a mother might use, speaking about a favorite, unruly child. <br>Pegeen blew some exasperated air through her pooched-out lower lip. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know what the blazes makes me fall,&#x201d; she said impatiently. &#x201c;I do it all the time.&#x201d; She suddenly squinted and the flush just under her downy skin rose to a deep maroon. She lowered her face to mine. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t you dare tell my mother,&#x201d; she said. <br>I was seven years old. I spoke mostly to my parents. To my brother. To my teachers when I had to. I gave some whispered response to Father Quinn or to Mr. Lee at the candy store when my mother poked me in the ribs. I could not imagine having a conversation with Mrs. Chehab, who was red-haired and very tall. Still, I promised. I would say nothing. <br>Pegeen shook herself again, standing back and lifting her shoulders inside the pale blue coat. &#x201c;But there&#x2019;s always someone nice,&#x201d; she said, her voice suddenly gone singsong. &#x201c;Someone always helps me up.&#x201d; She struck another pose, coy and haughty, as before, her chin in the air. She touched the feather in her hat. &#x201c;Today a very handsome man gave me his hand. He asked if I was all right. A real Prince Charming.&#x201d; She smiled again and looked around. Just a few doors down, the older boys were playing stickball in the street. There was a knot of younger ones on the curb, watching. Bill Corrigan was in his chair on the sidewalk just behind them. <br>Pegeen leaned forward once more. &#x201c;Tomorrow,&#x201d; she said breathlessly, whispering now, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to look for him again. If I see him, I&#x2019;m going to get real close.&#x201d; She leaned down, her hand on the banister above my head. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m going to <i>pretend</i> to fall, see? Right next to him. And he&#x2019;ll catch me and say, &#x2018;Is it you again?&#x2019;&#x201d; <br>All human eyes are beautiful, but Pegeen&#x2019;s were very black and heavily lashed and gorgeous now, with the sparkle of her joke, or her plan, or, perhaps, her vision of some impossible future. <br>She straightened up. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll see what happens then,&#x201d; she said, sly and confident, her thick eyebrows raised. She swung her purse slowly, turned to move on. &#x201c;That will be something to see,&#x201d; she said. <br>At her own house, Pegeen didn&#x2019;t use the basement door, as usual. She climbed the stone steps, taking them one at a time, like a small child. At the top, she paused again to swat at the back of her coat, only touching the dirt with her wrist. It was early evening. Spring. I could see Pegeen&#x2019;s reflection in the oval glass of the outer door&#x2014;or at least the blue heart of the reflection, which was both the reflection of her good spring coat and the evening light on her flushed face. Pegeen pulled open the door and the thin image in the glass shuddered like a flame. <br>I turned back to the vigil I was keeping on the stone steps. Vigil for my father, who had not yet come up from the subway. <br>From the far corner, the neighborhood&#x2019;s men and working women were coming home. Everyone wore hats. Everyone wore trim dark shoes, which was where my eyes fell when any of them said, &#x201c;Hello, Marie,&#x201d; passing by. <br>At seven, I was a shy child, and comical-looking, with a round flat face and black slits for eyes, thick glasses, black bangs, a straight and serious mouth&#x2014;a little girl cartoon. <br>With my heart pinned to my father&#x2019;s sleeve in those days. <br>The boys were playing stickball down the street. Always at this time of day. Some of them friends of Gabe, my brother, although he, young scholar, remained inside at his books. The younger boys were lined at the curb, watching the game, Walter Hartnett among them. He had his cap turned backward and the leg with the built-up shoe extended before him. Blind Bill Corrigan, who had been gassed in the war, was on the sidewalk just behind Walter, sitting in the painted kitchen chair that his mother set out for him every morning when the weather was fine. <br>Bill Corrigan wore a business suit and polished shoes, and although there was a glitch in the skin around his eyes, a scarred shine in the satiny folds of his eyelids, although he was brought to the kitchen chair every afternoon when the weather was fine by his mother, whose arm he held the way a bride holds the arm of a groom, it was to him that the boys in the street appealed whenever a dropped ball or an untimely tag sent both teams, howling and cawing, to his side of the street. They were there now: shouting into one another&#x2019;s face, throwing their caps on the ground, and begging Bill Corrigan to make the call. He raised one of his big, pale hands, and suddenly half the boys spun around, the other half cheered. Walter Hartnett rocked backward in despair, raising his good foot into the air. <br>I pushed my glasses back on my nose. Small city birds the color of ashes rose and fell along the rooftops. In the fading evening light, the stoop beneath my thighs, as warm as breath when I first sat down, now exhaled a shallow chill. Mr. Chehab walked by with a brown bag from the bakery in his hand. He had his white apron balled up beneath his arm, the ties trailing. There was the scent of new-baked bread as he passed. Big Lucy, a girl I feared, pushed a scooter along the opposite sidewalk. Two Sisters of Charity from the convent down the street passed by, smiling from inside their bonnets. I turned my head to watch their backs, wondering always why their long hems never caught at their heels. At the end of the block, the Sisters paused to greet a heavy woman with thick, pale legs and a dark apron under her coat. She said something to them that made them nod. Then the three turned the corner together. The game paused again, and the boys parted reluctantly as a black car drove by. <br>I shivered and waited, little Marie. Sole survivor, now, of that street scene. Waited for the first sighting of my father, coming up from the subway in his hat and coat, most beloved among all those ghosts. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Once, I stepped up to the glass case in the delicatessen in Rego Park, ready to call out my order. I was pregnant with my first child, hungry, a little light-headed. In a few months&#x2019; time, I would be at death&#x2019;s door, last rites and all&#x2014;my mother swinging her purse at the head of the priest who came to deliver them&#x2014;but on this day there was only a sudden rupture behind my eyes. I fell without knowing I fell, like a sack of potatoes. And then I was faceup on the wooden floor. My legs were turned beneath me. There was an ache along the fleshy edge of my palm. Faces above me. More pain dawning, in my ankle, at the back of my skull. There was tuna salad on my hand and on my elbow and on the edge of my spring coat, where I had caught somebody&#x2019;s order going down. I saw only the aproned bosom of the owner&#x2019;s wife as I was lifted and led to a chair in the back room. There was sawdust on the floor and brown towers of damp cardboard boxes along one wall. A strong smell of salami. They sat me down in a metal folding chair that was the same color as the cardboard boxes, before a flimsy card table scored with tape. There was the slow reconstruction of what had happened. A policeman appeared, offered a trip to the emergency room, although the consensus among the other women crowded into the narrow doorway was that the slow sipping from a warm bottle of Coke would revive me. Which it did. And then the roast beef on rye I had been about to order, which the owner&#x2019;s German wife watched me eat in the crowded back room&#x2014;the meat piled thickly and as tender as butter&#x2014;until the women were satisfied enough to declare, No harm done. The owner&#x2019;s wife gave me a container of chicken soup and a quart of rice pudding to take home. She was a broad, solid woman with thick arms and legs. She swiped vigorously at the stain on my coat with a wad of dampened paper towel, and I remembered Pegeen then: There&#x2019;s always someone nice. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>My father appeared at the corner. Paused for his evening paper. Topcoat and hat to mark him as a clerk, not a laborer. I only raised my head above my knees when I saw him&#x2014;although surely something, some sinewy energy, some delight, tensed and trembled itself through my thin back and shoulders as I gazed down the sloping street. The boys playing stickball parted once again for a passing car: it was the ebb and flow of their game. I turned away from them, raised a hand to the balustrade to get ready to spring. My father was a thin, slight man in a long coat. His step was quick and jaunty. He, too, wore shoes with a high shine. <br>I waited until he was halfway toward home. And then I flew, across the sidewalk and into the air as he lifted me&#x2014;the newspaper held tightly under his arm the only impediment, it seemed, to an ascent that I saw in my own imagination as equivalent, somehow, to the caps the boys had thrown into the air when Bill Corrigan made his call. I would not have been surprised to hear them cheer. <br>My father smelled, always, of fresh newsprint and cigarettes, of the alcohol in his faded cologne. I caught my chin on his buttons as he lowered me to the ground. A brief, painful scrape that upset my glasses and made my eyes water. I walked the last few paces home balanced on his shoes. We climbed the steps together and into the fragrant vestibule&#x2014;fragrant with the onion odor of cooked dinners and the brownstone scent of old wood&#x2014;and up the narrow stairs and into the apartment, where my mother was in the kitchen and my brother at the dining-room table with his books. <br>The apartment we lived in was long and narrow, with windows in the front and in the back. The back caught the morning light and the front the slow, orange hours of the afternoon and evening. Even at this cool hour in late spring, it was a dusty, city light. It fell on paint-polished window seats and pink carpet roses. It stamped the looming plaster walls with shadowed crossbars, long rectangles; it fit itself through the bedroom door, crossed the living room, climbed the sturdy legs of the formidable dining-room chairs, and was laid out now on the dining-room table where the cloth&#x2014;starched linen expertly decorated with my mother&#x2019;s meticulous cross-stitch&#x2014;had been carefully folded back along the whole length so that Gabe could place his school blotter and his books on the smooth wood. <br>It was the first light my poor eyes ever knew. Recalling it, I sometimes wonder if all the faith and all the fancy, all the fear, the speculation, all the wild imaginings that go into the study of heaven and hell, don&#x2019;t shortchange, after all, that other, earlier uncertainty: the darkness before the slow coming to awareness of the first light. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>I followed my father to the narrow closet and held the newspaper for him while he hung up his overcoat and placed his hat on the shelf. He went to the couch in the living room and I went with him, fitting myself into his side, leaning heavily against his arm&#x2014;&#x201c;like a barnacle,&#x201d; he said&#x2014;as he read the evening paper. <br>The slipcover, also my mother&#x2019;s handiwork, was a paradise of hummingbirds and vines and deep-throated flowers, the colors, if not the images, subdued by the thick brocade. Sinking into my father&#x2019;s side, slipping under his arm as he patiently lifted the open paper to accommodate me, I entered that paradise via my tracing fingertip and squinted eyes, until he said, &#x201c;Marie,&#x201d; patiently, and asked me to sit up a bit. <br>He kept a long key chain attached to his belt, and perhaps to keep my bony weight from putting his arm to sleep, he pulled the keys at the end of it out of his pocket and placed them in my hands. There were two keys, small but heavy, and the metal disks with his embossed name and number from his time in the army, as well as a small St. Joseph medal tinged with green. I turned them over as he read, traced them with my fingers, tested the weight and the jingle of them. I wondered if Bill Corrigan, who had been gassed in the war, carried something of the same in his pocket. <br>When my mother called to me to get up and set the table, my father put his hand to the top of my head. <br>*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;* <br>Slipping out o...</p><h2>Space</h2><p>Already a renowned chronicler of the epic events of world history, James A.

Sought help in vain.<br><br><b>A Night To Remember</b><br><br>From the first distress flares to the struggles of those left adrift for hours in freezing waters, here is the legendary disaster relived by the few who survived and can never forget the many who did not.</p><p>James Cameron's 1997 <i>Titanic</i> movie is a smash hit, but Walter Lord's 1955 classic remains in some ways unsurpassed. Lord interviewed scores of <i>Titanic</i> passengers, fashioning a gripping you-are-there account of the ship's sinking that you can read in half the time it takes to see the film. The book boasts many perfect movie moments not found in Cameron's film. When the ship hits the berg, passengers see "tiny splinters of ice in the air, fine as dust, that give off myriads of bright colors whenever caught in the glow of the deck lights." Survivors saw dawn reflected off other icebergs in a rainbow of shades, depending on their angle toward the sun: pink, mauve, white, deep blue--a landscape so eerie, a little boy tells his mom, "Oh, Muddie, look at the beautiful North Pole with no Santa Claus on it." <p> A <i>Titanic</i> funnel falls, almost hitting a lifeboat--and consequently washing it 30 yards away from the wreck, saving all lives aboard. One man calmly rides the vertical boat down as it sinks, steps into the sea, and doesn't even get his head wet while waiting to be successfully rescued. On one side of the boat, almost no males are permitted in the lifeboats; on the other, even a male Pekingese dog gets a seat. Lord includes a crucial, tragically ironic drama Cameron couldn't fit into the film: the failure of the nearby ship <i>Californian</i> to save all those aboard the sinking vessel because distress lights were misread as random flickering and the telegraph was an early wind-up model that no one wound. </p><p> Lord's account is also smarter about the horrifying class structure of the disaster, which Cameron reduces to hollow Hollywood formula. No children died in the First and Second Class decks; 53 out of 76 children in steerage died. According to the press, which regarded the lower-class passengers as a small loss to society, "The night was a magnificent confirmation of women and children first, yet somehow the loss rate was higher for Third Class children than First Class men." As the ship sank, writes Lord, "the poop deck, normally Third Class space ... was suddenly becoming attractive to all kinds of people." Lord's logic is as cold as the Atlantic, and his bitter wit is quite dry.</p>"Devotion, gallantry...Benjamin Guggenheim changing to evening clothes to meet death; Mrs. Isador Straus clinging to her husband, refusing to get in a lifeboat; Arthur Ryerson giving his life belt to his wife's maid...It is a book to remember."<br><i>--Chicago Tribune</i></p><h2>ATTENTION: Dispatches from a Land of Distraction</h2><p><b>&#x201c;<i>Attention&nbsp;</i>reveals a fresh, vital literary voice as it covers seemingly every imaginable topic relating to modern life.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;</b><br><b>&#x201c;Joshua Cohen may be America&#x2019;s greatest living writer.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>The Washington Post</i></b><br><br><b>NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY <i>WIRED</i></b><br><br> One of <i>Granta</i>&#x2019;s Best of Young American Novelists, Joshua Cohen arrives with his first collection of nonfiction, the culmination of two decades of writing and thought about life in the digital age.

Because people have to be told, they don&#x2019;t always know how to act in the face of the extraordinary.&nbsp;. . . I don&#x2019;t know what I&#x2019;m doing next.

No rings remain into which to throw your hat: The circus is shutting down.<br><br>On January 14, 2017, Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus (henceforth RBandB&amp;BC)&#x2014;�America&#x2019;s oldest and best circus, America&#x2019;s last true touring circus&#x2014;�announced that it was closing, and six days later the country mourned, with an exit parade, a grand-�finale funeral: the inauguration of Donald J. Trump.<br><br>From its very inception, which was coeval with this country&#x2019;s inception, the American circus has been the imaginative grounds of American politics; its touring circuits became campaign circuits; its audiences became constituencies; its capacities for fame became convertible to power. And so the fact of its folding, especially now, can seem like a tragedy: equivalent to the tragedy of Trump, or even entwined.<br><br>At the very least, the shuttering of America&#x2019;s top big top represents the shuttering of a substantial American culture: a medium, an aesthetics, a way of life, which has been dragging itself around this country, and around the world, under some merged, acquired, or freestanding variation of RBandB&amp;BC&#x2019;s moniker almost continuously for the last 146 years&#x2014;�ever since the presidency of Ulysses S. Grant.<br><br>The circus: No other art form has ever been so vulnerable. No other art form has so swiftly become endangered and gone extinct. You can&#x2019;t, after all, bring about the end of the novel. You can&#x2019;t, try as you might, suspend the poem. But Feld Entertainment (the circus&#x2019;s sole proprietor) can drop and&#x2014;�with a proper display of fanfare, hesitancy, and remorse&#x2014;�has dropped the curtain on the three-�ring lions-�and-�tigers-�and-�bears-�oh-�my Greatest Show on Earth�, and ladies, gentlemen, and kids of all ages, the loss feels as fundamental, but also as fundamentally contentious, as the death of jazz, or the death of the blues.<br><br>Because just like old black music was &#x201c;appropriated&#x201d; into newer, whiter pop, the American circus comes to a close having been gutted of nearly all of its major technical innovations, attractions, and acts, which have since gone on&#x2014;�as if in a descent into an antiseptic �afterlife&#x2014;�to become the baseline components of contemporary performance, especially of contemporary recorded or mediated performance.<br><br>Not to be a joss (circus-�people slang for noncircus people) by spelling this out, but: The circus was how acrobatics and juggling got to the Super Bowl halftime; it was how magic got to Vegas. The circus trained the animals to sit, stay, and roll over for TV and Holly�wood, and pioneered the stunt work involved with leaping out of a conflagrant speeding vehicle and landing safely, way back in the dinosaur days before CGI.<br><br>The chief genius of the circus, of course, was to have staged all this spectacle and more, always more, all at once, and for one low price of admission&#x2014;�not merely live, but so precariously, proximately live that we the glutted audience were forced to contemplate the mortal risks being undertaken for our entertainment.<br><br>The earliest modern &#x201c;circi&#x201d; were glorified riding demonstrations, single-�ring answers to that most ancient of questions: What do you do with your soldiers in peacetime? In 1768, on the eve of what the British call the American War of Independence, Philip Astley and his fellow cavalrymen of the Fifteenth Light Dragoons opened an outdoor &#x201c;riding school&#x201d; at a track outside London. What made their presentation a circus, in the sense that we&#x2019;d know it, was that it combined the displays of equestrian prowess&#x2014;�including trick-�riding, jumping, and military maneuvers in the styles of the Prussians and Hessian hussars&#x2014;�with interludes of clowning that allowed the riders and horses to rest, and were thought to appeal to women and children. Astley&#x2019;s most popular routine was, at heart, a lampooning of democracy. It involved a clown, cast as the folk hero Billy Buttons, an everyman tailor who keeps trying to mount a horse to ride to the polls to vote in an election, but can&#x2019;t quite get his act together: His saddle slips; his boot becomes stuck in a stirrup and he&#x2019;s dragged; finally, he sits up in the saddle, but in the wrong direction, ass-�facing; he spurs the horse into motion, only to fall.<br>In January 2016, almost exactly a year before RBandB&amp;BC&#x2019;s end was announced, almost exactly a year before Trump swore his oath, the following exchange occurred on Meet the Press:<br><br>CHUCK TODD: As you know, people call you a lot of names. Some of it&#x2019;s positive, some of it&#x2019;s negative. I want to throw some by you. Let&#x2019;s see. Some people are calling you the Music Man of this race. Kim Kardashian. Biff, from Back to the Future. George Costanza. P. T. Barnum. What&#x2019;s&#x2014;�any of those do you consider a compliment? Or do you&#x2014;�<br><br>DONALD TRUMP: P. T. Barnum.<br><br>TODD: You&#x2019;ll take the P. T. Barnum?<br><br>TRUMP: P. T. Barnum. Look, people call you names. We need P. T. Barnum, a little bit, because we have to build up the image of our country.<br><br>Racism, misogyny, poor-�hating, know-�nothingism&#x2014;�by that point in the campaign, Trump had conditioned the public to expect anything, everything, from him, except this: insight. This introspection that most of America&#x2014;�that most of even Trump&#x2019;s America&#x2014;�had simultaneously been hoping for, yet hoping against. Here was a Trump who not only appeared to understand Barnum, but also appeared to understand himself.<br><br>Either that or he was just repeating the last thing he&#x2019;d heard.<br><br>A year later, however, it&#x2019;s tempting to wonder whether now-�President Trump has changed his mind&#x2014;�which is to say, with the end of RBandB&amp;BC, might Trump regard its founder as a FAILURE&nbsp;. . . a LOSER&nbsp;. . . SAD? Or might he still admire Barnum, because though the business is perished, the name yet survives?<br><br>The name or, as Trump put it on Meet the Press, the &#x201c;image&#x201d;: a conceit for which Barnum, who had the benefit of Gilded Age lexical niceties, tended to use terms like &#x201c;public opinion,&#x201d; &#x201c;reputation,&#x201d; and &#x201c;character.&#x201d;<br><br>Also &#x201c;appearance,&#x201d; as in Barnum&#x2019;s nostrum: &#x201c;Put on the appearance of business, and generally the reality will follow.&#x201d;<br><br>Generally: but not in the case of the circus.<br><br>In 1782, one of Astley&#x2019;s former riders, Charles Hughes, founded his own clown-�and-�pony show, which he called&#x2014;�in a mingling of Roman imperial and British monarchial gravities&#x2014;�the Royal Circus, and, in 1793, one of Hughes&#x2019;s former riders, John Bill Ricketts, brought a rowdier version to America, taking over a hippodrome in Philadelphia, where President Washington was among the first visitors. According to legend, Washington so enjoyed himself that he agreed to sell Ricketts his favorite white battle charger, Old Jack, for $150, and, in 1797, when Ricketts opened a circus in New York City, Old Jack hobbled along, and spent its retirement on exhibition, being fed lump sugar and petted by patriotic strangers.<br><br>On the surface, at least, which is where all vain fame addicts are happiest, Phineas Taylor Barnum (b. 1810) and Donald John Trump (b. 1946) might seem to share some traits in common: obsessions with pachydermatous size and promotional hype, along with a manic drive to project themselves, or their wishful selves, for profit. Both entered politics only later in life, capitalizing on their earlier careers as showmen. Both had lucrative sidelines in land speculation and development and mortifying dalliances with bankruptcy; both married significantly younger women (Trump and Melania Knauss: twenty-�four-�year age gap; Barnum and Nancy Fish: forty), inveighed against smoking and alcohol, and wrote or &#x201c;wrote&#x201d; volumes of self-�aggrandizing self-�help (The Art of the Deal is basically Barnum&#x2019;s The Art of Money Getting, just with cruder prose and monetary sums adjusted for inflation by roundabout 200 percent). Both achieved notoriety through making unfulfillable promises to their countrymen who lived in the interior, far from the coasts they called home, and, above all, both amassed their fortunes by lying and then by proprietizing their lies through licensing or &#x201c;branding,&#x201d; which in Barnum&#x2019;s day was more usually performed upon the bodies of livestock and slaves.<br><br>That said, Barnum&#x2014;�who became more liberal as he aged, or just more of a fervent Unionist during the Civil War&#x2014;�never got any further in politics than two terms in the Connecticut General Assembly (where his big issue, as the owner of an itinerant circus, was the breaking of the railroad trusts) and one term as the mayor of Bridgeport (where his big issue, as the head of a circus that wintered in Bridgeport, was utilities modernization). Trump, by contrast, has by the time of this writing already managed (among much else) to drop the largest nonnuclear bomb in the American arsenal on Afghanistan.<br><br>That the first hundred days of Trump&#x2019;s presidency coincided with the last hundred days of Barnum&#x2019;s circus seemed a sign. It seemed to represent a final &#x201c;appropriation&#x201d;&#x2014;�not of any circus routine this time, but of a basic circus principle: Chaos, or the artful manipulation of the image of chaos, was now being staged not in the center ring but in the Oval Office.<br><br>Kenneth Feld, CEO, Feld Entertainment, owner and operator of RBandB&amp;BC<br><br>The biggest resentment I have is when they say Washington is run like a circus. If only it was so disciplined and organized.<br><br>Here&#x2019;s the provenance, the tangled line of succession: In 1870, Barnum and William Cameron Coup established P. T. Barnum&#x2019;s Grand Traveling Museum, Menagerie, Caravan &amp; Hippodrome, which met with great acclaim, and train derailments, collisions, labor disputes, and fires, until, in 1881, it hitched itself to a rival circus run by two Jameses: Bailey and Hutchinson. After Barnum&#x2019;s death in 1891, Bailey&#x2014;�formerly the ringmaster&#x2014;�assumed control, and after Bailey&#x2019;s death in 1906, five of the seven Ringling Bros. of Baraboo, Wisconsin&#x2014;�the sons of a German immigrant (R�ngeling), who&#x2019;d been running their own circuses since the 1880s&#x2014;�purchased the remnants of Barnum &amp; Bailey&#x2019;s, and presented it as a separate enterprise until 1919, when they consolidated all their properties into a lone extravaganza.<br><br>John Ringling North, a Ringling Bros. nephew, spent most of the &#x2019;50s partnering with, and in 1967 finally sold his family&#x2019;s show to, a man named Irvin Feld, a son of Russian Jews who&#x2019;d parlayed the success of his Washington, D.C.&#x2013;�area record emporium into the then-�novel field of concert promotion, primarily packaging black artists for majority white audiences: Chuck Berry, Fats Domino, the Platters, the Drifters.<br><br>America under Eisenhower was in the midst of a building boom, fueled by its large labor force of veterans. To be considered a city in this country&#x2014;�a true destination city&#x2014;�you had to have an amphitheater: a War Memorial Stadium or Soldiers&#x2019; Arena. This was the last age in which public buildings were still named after public servants or epochal events, and not yet banks or cable companies. But with only eight teams in the NBA and six teams in the NHL, there wasn&#x2019;t much happening inside them. Irvin Feld, more than anyone else in &#x2019;50s and &#x2019;60s America, developed and promoted the &#x201c;content,&#x201d; whatever would fill the seats.<br><br>And so the circus: It was Feld&#x2019;s innovation to ditch the tent and bring the American circus indoors, and he announced this grand-�scale relaunch with a purchasing ceremony at the Coliseum: not the one in Nassau County, Long Island, where the circus held its last show on Memorial Day Weekend this year, but the one in Rome.<br><br>By promoting a relatively luxurious circus experience&#x2014;�a circus roofed, and amenitized with A/C and upholstered seating&#x2014;�Feld gave RBandB&amp;BC another half century of life, but also changed the nature of the spectacle. The show, now, had to get bigger by the season, not just to impress in bigger surroundings, but also to reimpress itself on younger generations weaned on screens. What followed was an increasingly unsustainable balancing act, between the circus&#x2019;s constant adaptation to impatient if not childish tastes and the maintenance of the slower-�paced traditional elements preferred by the paying adults, who yearned for RBandB&amp;BC as it used to be, or as they imagined it used to be: Americana, not America.<br><br>But by the time Irvin Feld died, in 1984, and his son, Kenneth, took over, running a circus in this country meant hiring the preponderance of your performers from overseas. The best strongmen were Bulgarian; the best trampolinists were Romanian; the foremost equilibrists were from Russia and Ukraine (often alumni of the USSR Olympic gymnastics program), while most of the horse talent was sourced from Central Asia. In the Soviet sphere, the &#x201c;circus arts&#x201d; were always considered official national arts, on par with academic painting and sculpture, and so were supported with state money at state circus schools connected to state circuses. Kenneth Feld would fly behind the Iron Curtain almost annually, seeking performers to sign to twelve-�week stints (the maximum that they were permitted to travel and work in America), and though defections were common, his access was never completely curtailed, because the governments&#x2014;�acting as talent agents to Feld&#x2019;s talent scout&#x2014;�would take a percentage on all contracts, and RBandB&amp;BC deals were reliable sources of hard cash.<br><br>With the USSR in collapse, RBandB&amp;BC began hiring a rising number of Chinese performers&#x2014;�who, along with the current ample contingent of South and Central American performers, helped to put on this most North American, this most proudly American-�American, of shows. These immigrant or, more precisely, these wandering-�migrant performers were doing the jobs that most natural-�born Americans now just can&#x2019;t or won&#x2019;t do: hanging upside-�down and executing multiple somersaults between trapezes.<br><br>The circus, like the Circus Americanus&#x2014;�aka America at large&#x2014;�is and has always been about foreigners and the otherwise Othered putting themselves in harm&#x2019;s way for the delectation of paying natives. But while both madcap enterprises are decidedly capitalistic, RBandB&amp;BC functions internally like a planned economy, a heterogeneous mobile welfare state governed in toto by a single family (Kenneth Feld&#x2019;s three daughters are company executives). Due to the logistics of touring, all circus employees receive, in addition to their salaries, full room and board. They eat with the circus, they sleep with the circus. Most of what they casually wear, at least most of their casual outerwear, appears to be circus-�branded. Their children, both the children who perform and the children who don&#x2019;t, learn with circus teachers and go to circus dentists and circus doctors. Their pets, like the animal performers, go to circus veterinarians. This bizarre but constitutive expenditure is one reason, but only one, why the circus is failing.</p><h2>Sharing the Dance: Contact Improvisation and American Culture (New Directions in Anthropological Writing)</h2><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In <i>Sharing the Dance</i>, Cynthia Novack considers the development of contact improvisation within its web of historical, social, and cultural contexts.&nbsp; This&nbsp; book examines the ways contact improvisers (and their surrounding communities) encode sexuality, spontaneity, and gender roles, as well as concepts of the self and society in their dancing.<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While focusing on the changing practice of contact improvisation through two decades of social transformation, Novack&#x2019;s work incorporates the history of rock dancing and disco, the modern and experimental dance movements of Merce Cunningham, Anna Halprin, and Judson Church, among others, and a variety of other physical activities, such as martial arts, aerobics, and wrestling.</p><p>Cynthia J. Novack is an anthropologist, dancer/choreographer, and teacher. She is assistant professor of dance at Wesleyan College and a member of the Richard Bull Dance Theatre.&#x201c;In her book on contact improvisation and American culture, Novack finds a good balance between a clear analysis of the movement itself and a selected history of the cultural context of the inception of this dance form.&nbsp; . . .&nbsp; Novack has included a chapter based on her own experience with learning contact improvisation, which gives her historical writing a kind of self-reflexivity that is especially important within the field of dance scholarship.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Choice</i><br><br>&#x201c;Cynthia J.

Now, in her powerful hardcover debut, she takes us on a desperate manhunt for a sadistic killer who preys upon his victims&#x2019; innermost fears &#x2014; just before he claims their lives.<br><br>What do you do when a killer targets the people you love most? How do you protect them when he knows their most secret fears and hidden desires? When he knows just when to strike? And, most of all, when he knows the same about you?<br><br>These are the questions that haunt FBI Special Agent Pierce Quincy. The official police report concluded that his daughter&#x2019;s death was an accident.

Now it&#x2019;s time for Rainie to return the favor.<br><br>But this killer is like none these two hard-boiled pros have ever encountered. This twisted psychopath has an insatiable hunger for revenge ... and for fear. He isn&#x2019;t satisfied with taking his victims&#x2019; lives. He wants to get inside their minds, strip them of every defense, render them powerless to resist.<br><br>He&#x2019;s already killed twice; now he&#x2019;s taunting Quincy and Rainie by making it no secret who his next victim will be: Quincy&#x2019;s only surviving daughter.<br><br>The killer&#x2019;s plan is chilling, brilliant, and unstoppable. The cops won&#x2019;t help; the FBI can&#x2019;t be trusted. As the clock ticks down to the final minutes of one unspeakably intimate act of vengeance, the only way Rainie can unmask this faceless killer is to step directly in his murderous path.

As in the first novel, four teen girls who have known each other since birth (their moms shared a pregnancy aerobics class) further forge their bond of friendship through a pair of thrift-store jeans that magically, impossibly, fits them all perfectly.<p> Like the summer before, Carmen, Bridget, Tibby, and Lena share their individual adventures with the Pants collective, creating an engaging, kaleidoscopic narrative of four voices. This summer, Tibby attends a film program in Virginia and Bridget (Bee), whose mother has died, impulsively jets off to Alabama to get reacquainted with her estranged grandmother. Lovely Lena tries to protect herself from the heartbreak of loving her long-distance Greek god boyfriend Kostos, and Carmen deals (poorly) with her mother dating again and having the nerve to borrow the Pants!</p><p> <i>The Second Summer</i>, while breezy and fun to read, deals seriously with love lost and found, death, and finding the courage to live honestly. The teens' lessons are often painful, but the Sisterhood prevails. Quotations from luminaries such as Charlie Brown ("Nothing takes the taste out of peanut butter quite like unrequited love") to Nelson Mandela ("There is nothing like returning to a place that remains unchanged to find the ways in which you yourself have altered") open each chapter and cleverly reflect the novel's many moods.

Could they possibly get worse? </p> <p> Violet, Klaus, and Sunny Baudelaire are fortunate to have found a new guardian, Aunt Josephine. Even though she is unusually nervous, she seems nice enough. </p> <p> And the children are also fortunate to be living so close to a large body of water. It's true that the lake is teeming with ferocious leeches -- but if the children wait one hour after eating, they can go swimming. </p> <p> It is fortunate, too, that the siblings have such a splendid view of the big dark lake. Never mind the news that Hurricane Herman is racing toward them; Aunt Josephine's house is built sturdily on a cliff. </p> <p> But above all, the children are lucky that they have a home now where they can rest up. For these are the unlucky Baudelaire orphans, and they will certainly need all their strength when everything that could possibly go wrong, suddenly does. </p></p><p>In <i>The Bad Beginning</i>, things, well, begin badly for the three Baudelaire orphans. And sadly, events only worsen in <i>The Reptile Room</i>. In the third in Lemony Snicket's Series of Unfortunate Events, there is still no hope on the horizon for these poor children. Their adventures are exciting and memorable, but, as the author points out, "exciting and memorable like being chased by a werewolf through a field of thorny bushes at midnight with nobody around to help you." <p> This story begins when the orphans are being escorted by the well-meaning Mr. Poe to yet another distant relative who has agreed to take them in since their parents were killed in a horrible fire. Aunt Josephine, their new guardian, is their second cousin's sister-in-law, and she is afraid of everything. Her house (perched precariously on a cliff above Lake Lachrymose) is freezing because she is afraid of the radiator exploding, she eats cold cucumber soup because she's afraid of the stove, and she doesn't answer the telephone due to potential electrocution dangers. Her greatest joy in life is grammar, however, and when it comes to the proper use of the English language, she is fearless. </p><p> But just when she should be the most fearful--when Count Olaf creeps his way back to find the Baudelaire orphans and steal their fortune--she somehow lets her guard down. Once again, it is up to Violet, Klaus, and Sunny to get themselves out of danger. Will they succeed? We haven't the stomach to tell you. (Ages 9 to 12) <i>--Karin Snelson</i></p><p>Dear Reader,</p><p>If you have not read anything about the Baudelaire orphans, then before you read even one more sentence, you should know this: Violet, Klaus, and Sunny are kindhearted and quick-witted, but their lives, I am sorry to say, are filled with bad luck and misery. All of the stories about these three children are unhappy and wretched, and this one may be the worst of them all.If you haven't got the stomach for a story that includes a hurricane, a signalling device, hungry leeches, cold cucumber soup, a horrible villain, and a doll named Pretty Penny, then this book will probably fill you with despair.I will continue to record these tragic tales, for that is what I do. You, however, should decide for yourself whether you can possibly endure this miserable story.</p><p>With all due respect,</p><p>Lemony Snicket</p><br></p><h2>Off Armageddon Reef</h2><p>Humanity pushed its way to the stars - and encountered the Gbaba, a ruthless alien race that nearly wiped us out.<br>&nbsp;<br>Earth and her colonies are now smoldering ruins, and the few survivors have fled to distant, Earth-like Safehold, to try to rebuild.&nbsp; But the Gbaba can detect the emissions of an industrial civilization, so the human rulers of Safehold have taken extraordinary measures: with mind control and hidden high technology, they've built a religion in which <i>every</i> Safeholdian believes, a religion designed to keep Safehold society medieval forever.<br>&nbsp;<br>800 years pass. In a hidden chamber on Safehold, an android from the far human past awakens. This "rebirth" was set in motion centuries before, by a faction that opposed shackling humanity with a concocted religion. Via automated recordings, "Nimue" - or, rather, the android with the memories of Lieutenant Commander Nimue Alban - is told her fate: she will emerge into Safeholdian society, suitably disguised, and begin the process of provoking the technological progress which the Church of God Awaiting has worked for centuries to prevent.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;<br>Nothing about this will be easy. To better deal with a medieval society, "Nimue" takes a new gender and a new name, "Merlin."&nbsp; His formidable powers and &nbsp;access to caches of hidden high technology will need to be carefully concealed.&nbsp; And he'll need to find a base of operations, a Safeholdian country that's just a little more freewheeling, a little less orthodox, a little more open to the new. <br>&nbsp;<br>And thus Merlin comes to Charis, a mid-sized kingdom with a talent for naval warfare. He plans to make the acquaintance of King Haarahld and Crown Prince Cayleb, and maybe, just maybe, kick off a new era of invention.&nbsp; Which is bound to draw the attention of the Church...and, inevitably, lead to war.<br>&nbsp;<br>It's going to be a long, long process.&nbsp; And it's going to be the can't-miss SF epic of the decade.</p><p>David Weber is the author of the <i>New York Times-</i>bestselling "Honor Harrington" series, the most recent of which was <i>At All Costs.</i> His many other novels include <i>Mutineers' Moon, The Armageddon Inheritance, Heirs of Empire, Path of the Fury, </i>and <i>Wind Rider's Oath.</i> He lives in South Carolina.OFF ARMAGEDDON REEF<br>&nbsp;<br>By David Weber<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Context:</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br>The Terran Federation Navy fought desperately for over forty years, but the ruthless species known as the Gbaba slaughtered the human race's extra-Solar colonies one by one. Now the end had finally come; Earth herself lay under siege by an enemy humankind could not defeat.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And so mankind undertook one last throw of the dice: Operation Ark. Earth's final colonizing expedition was meant to build a new civilization, on a planet so distant even the Gbaba might never find it, and without the high-tech infrastructure whose emissions might betray its location. To protect and conceal that expedition, the Navy's final fleet was prepared to die to the last ship. Lieutenant Commander Nimue Alban volunteered to serve on the flagship of that fleet, knowing that she and everyone else aboard it would die...which was exactly what happened.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So she was a little surprised to wake up in a cave on a planet called Safehold. She was even more surprised to discover that she'd been dead for eight centuries...and that the fanatic administrators of Operation Ark had used mind control techniques to create a false, brutally suppressive religion in which every single Safeholdian believed. One whose entire purpose was to forbid invention and innovation forever. <br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone on Safehold knows the Church is the consecrated custodian of God's will. Everyone knows forbidden technology is the work of the Devil. And everyone knows that anyone who dabbles in the forbidden must be destroyed, lest everyone's soul be lost forever to damnation.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But a tiny fraction within Operation Ark's leadership remembered the truth and believed in human dignity and freedom. They've left Nimue Alban to oppose that monstrous creation, and they've given her a carefully hidden cache of technology and the capabilities of the android body in which her memories, loves, hopes, and dreams live on. It's her job to somehow provoke the that human progress which the Church of God Awaiting has worked centuries to crush. <br>&nbsp;<br>Now, in a new guise--that of the apparently male "Merlin"--Nimue comes to Charis, a mid-sized kingdom with a talent for naval warfare, to make the acquaintance of King Haarahld and Crown Prince Cayleb, and maybe, just maybe, kick off a new era of invention.&nbsp; In this excerpt, Merlin, having managed to save Cayleb from an attempted assassination, speaks with King Haarahld for the first time...<br>&nbsp;<br>.VI.<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Royal</i><i> </i><i>Palace</i><i>, Telesberg,</i><br><i>&nbsp;</i><br><i>Kingdom</i><i> of </i><i>Charis</i><br>&nbsp;<br>"<i>Seijin </i>Merlin, Your Majesty," the chamberlain said quietly as he stepped through the open doorway and bowed. Merlin followed him into the small presence chamber -- more of a working office, really, it seemed -- and bowed a bit more profoundly than the chamberlain. King Haarahld's court was looked down upon by the courtiers of such sophisticated lands as Harchong because of its casual informality and ability to get along without a veritable horde of servitors. Still, Haarahld was a king, and one of the more powerful ones on the face of Safehold, whatever others might think.<br>&nbsp;<br>"<i>Seijin</i>," Haarahld said, and Merlin looked up.<br>&nbsp;<br>He saw a man of middle years, stocky, for a Charisian, and taller than most, although shorter than his son and considerably shorter than Merlin. Haarahld wore the traditional loose-cut breeches and thigh-length linen over-tunic of the Charisian upperclass, although <i>his</i> tunic was bright with bullion embroidery and bead work. The belt about his waist was made of intricately decorated, seashell-shaped plaques of hammered silver, the golden scepter badge of one who'd made his required pilgrimage to the Temple gleamed on his shoulder brooch, and the glittering fire of the emerald-set golden chain which was his normal badge of office glowed upon his chest. He had a neatly trimmed beard, somewhat more luxuriant than Merlin's own, and the slight epicanthic fold common to most of Safehold's humanity. <br>&nbsp;<br>Haarahld VII was fifty-two local years old, just over forty-seven standard, and he'd sat on his throne for just over twenty local years. In that time, he'd come to be known -- by his own subjects, at least -- as "Haarahld the Just," and his level eyes considered Merlin thoughtfully. He was putting on a bit of extra flesh these days, Merlin noticed. Judging from his chest and shoulders, he'd been a man of heroic physique in his youth, but maintaining that sort of fitness, especially at his age, must have been the next best thing to impossible given his immobile right knee. His leg stretched out straight in front of him, his heel resting on a footrest, as he sat in a comfortable but not particularly splendid armchair behind a desk cluttered with documents and slates.<br>&nbsp;<br>One other person was present. A bishop of the Church of God Awaiting with silvering dark hair and a splendid patriarchal beard, stood at the king's right shoulder. His three-cornered cap bore the white cockade of a senior bishop, but lacked the ribbon of an archbishop. His eyes were bright as they considered Merlin, and his white cassock bore the oil lamp emblem of the Order of B�dard. <br>&nbsp;<br>The sight of that lamp set Merlin's teeth instantly on edge, but he made himself suppress the instinctive reaction firmly. Much as he hated to admit it, the order which bore Ador�e B�dard's name had changed over the years into something far different from anything its ostensible patron would have wanted to see. Besides, he'd "seen" this bishop often enough through his SNARCs to strongly suspect what impelled Haarahld to trust him so totally.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your Majesty," he murmured in reply to the king's greeting after only the briefest of pauses. "You do me honor to receive me privately."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Perhaps," Haarahld said, studying his visitor intently. "Some might feel I've slighted you by not greeting you and thanking you for my son's life in a more public audience."<br>&nbsp;<br>"But at that more public audience, Your Majesty, I would undoubtedly have been uncomfortably aware of all of the spanned crossbows watching me so alertly. Here," Merlin smiled charmingly, "I need worry only about the two bodyguards behind that screen."<br>&nbsp;<br>He nodded towards the exquisitely detailed lacquered Harchongese screen behind the king, and Haarahld's eyes narrowed. The bishop's, however, only considered Merlin with a sort of calm curiosity.<br>&nbsp;<br>Interesting, Merlin thought, but his attention was mainly focused on the king, waiting for <i>his</i> reaction. Which came after a heartbeat in a single word.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Indeed?" Haarahld said, and Merlin smiled again.<br>&nbsp;<br>"This is Thursday, Your Majesty. Assuming you've stuck to your regular duty schedule, it should be Sergeant Haarpar and Sergeant Gahrdaner."<br>&nbsp;<br>The chamberlain stepped quickly to one side, right hand falling to the dagger sheathed at his hip, the bishop touched the golden scepter of Langhorne hanging upon his breast, and even Haarahld sat up straighter in his chair. But the king also raised one hand, and shook his head sharply at the chamberlain.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No, Pawal," he said. "After all, our guest <i>is </i>a <i>seijin</i>, is he not?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Or something else, Sire," the chamberlain said darkly. He glowered at Merlin with eyes full of suspicion, and his hand left his dagger hilt only reluctantly.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your Majesty," Merlin said, "my weapons have all been left in my chamber. Your guardsmen were extremely courteous, but they also searched me very carefully before permitting me into your presence. Surely, one unarmed man is no threat to a monarch whose servants are as loyal to him as yours are to you."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Somehow, <i>Seijin </i>Merlin, I doubt a man such as you is ever unarmed, as long as he has his brain," Haarahld said with a slow, appreciative smile of his own.<br>&nbsp;<br>"One tries, Your Majesty," Merlin conceded.<br>&nbsp;<br>The bishop's lips twitched in what might almost have been a stillborn smile, and Haarahld leaned back in his chair once more, considering the blue-eyed stranger even more thoughtfully than before. Then he nodded and looked at the chamberlain.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Pawal, I believe we might offer <i>Seijin </i>Merlin a chair."<br>&nbsp;<br>Pawal Hahlmahn looked moderately outraged, but he also carried a straight-backed but upholstered chair from the corner of the room and set it down facing Haarahld's desk.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Please,<i> Seijin</i>," Haarahld invited. "Be seated."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Thank you, Your Majesty."<br>&nbsp;<br>Merlin settled into the chair and cocked his head, his eyebrows raised.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Yes,<i> Seijin</i>," Haarahld said with a suspiciously grin-like smile, "the interrogation will now begin."<br>&nbsp;<br>"I'm at your service, Your Majesty." Merlin inclined his head again, politely, and Haarahld chuckled.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I find that difficult to believe,<i> Seijin</i>," he said. "Somehow, I have the distinct impression that it's more a case of Charis finding herself at <i>your </i>service."<br>&nbsp;<br>Merlin smiled, but behind that smile he winced. Haarahld VII, in person, was even more impressive than he'd been observed from afar via SNARC.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Before we begin," Haarahld said more seriously, "allow me to extend my personal thanks for your intervention on Cayleb's behalf. Without you, he would be dead, and for that I and my house stand in your debt. How may I reward you?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your Majesty," Merlin said with matching seriousness, "while I'm sure some token of your gratitude is in order, it might be as well to draw as little attention to me as possible."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And why might that be?" Haarahld asked.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Because I'll be far more useful to Charis if my presence here doesn't become general knowledge."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And why should you care to be of use to me?"<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your pardon, Your Majesty," Merlin said almost gently, "but I didn't say of use to <i>you.</i> I said of use to <i>Charis.</i> The two are closely related, but not, I fear, identical."<br>&nbsp;<br>"The King <i>is </i>the Kingdom!" Hahlmahn snapped, then flushed darkly as he realized he'd spoken out of turn. But despite the flush, there was no hiding the fresh anger in his eyes.<br>&nbsp;<br>"No, My Lord Chamberlain," Merlin disagreed. "The King is the heart and soul of the Kingdom, but he is <i>not </i>the Kingdom itself. Were that true, then the Kingdom would perish with his death."<br>&nbsp;<br>"The Church teaches that King and Crown are one," the bishop observed, speaking for the first time, and his voice and expression were both carefully neutral.<br>&nbsp;<br>"And I don't dispute that point with the Church, Bishop Maikel," Merlin said, and the priest's head cocked to one side as the stranger named him correctly. "I simply observe that the King who is the heart of the Kingdom isn't merely a single individual, but all individuals who hold that office and discharge those duties in the name of the Kingdom. And so, while the King and the Kingdom are one, the mortal man who holds that office is but one man in an endless chain of men who hold their crowns in trust for those they are charged to guard and protect."<br>&nbsp;<br>Haarahld glanced up at Bishop Maikel, then returned his attention to Merlin and gazed at him without speaking for the better part of a full minute. Finally, he nodded slowly.<br>&nbsp;<br>"A valid distinction," he said. "Not one all monarchs would agree with, but one I can't dispute."<br>&nbsp;<br>"And the fact that you can't, Your Majesty, is the reason I'm here," Merlin said simply. "While all kings may be ordained by God, all too few prove worthy of their coronation oaths. When one sees the visions which I've been given to see, that fact becomes sadly evident."<br>&nbsp;<br>"Ah, yes, those 'visions' of yours." Haarahld pursed his lips, then chuckled and raised his voice slightly. "Charlz, you and Gorj may as well come out and join us."<br>&nbsp;<br>A moment later, the lacquered screen shifted to one side, and two Royal Guard sergeants stepped out from behind it. Both wore black cuirasses, the breastplates emblazoned with the golden kraken of Charis,. They also carried spanned, steel-bowed arbalests, and they regarded Merlin warily as they took their places at their king's back.<br>&nbsp;<br>"I must admit," Haarahld said, "that I found your performance rather impressive, <i>Seijin </i>Merlin. As, no doubt, you intended I should. Of course, it's always possible sufficiently good spies could have provided you with that information. On the other hand, if my personal household is that riddled with spies, my house is already doomed. So, since you obviously want me to ask the question, I will. How did you know?"<br>&nbsp;<br>Despite his whimsical tone, his brown eyes sharpened and he leaned slightly forward in his chair.<br>&nbsp;<br>"Your Majesty," Merlin replied, "these three men --" he waved one hand, taking in the two Guardsmen and the chamberlain " -- are, I believe, loyal unto death to you, your son, and your house. I trust them as fully as I trust you, yourself. And Bishop Maikel has been your confessor for -- what? Fifteen years now? But while what I'm about to tell you may prove difficult to believe, I hope to be able to offer you proof I speak the truth. And I believe that if I can prove that to you, you'll understand why it must be kept as secret as possible for as long as possible."<br>&nbsp;<br>He paused, and the king nodded without even glancing at his retainers. The three of them continued to regard Merlin with wary eyes, but Merlin saw how their shoulders straightened and their expressions firmed at the king's obvious confidence in their trustworthiness. Bishop Maikel simply moved a half-step closer to Haarahld's chair and rested one large, powerful hand lightly on its back.<br>&nbsp;<br>"As I'm sure Prince Cayleb and Lieutenant Falkhan have already told you, Your Majesty," he began, "I've lived for many years in the Mountains of Light, and in the process I've developed some, though far from all, of the reputed powers of the<i> seijin</i>. It isn't a title I would lightly claim for myself, yet it may be that it fits.<br>&nbsp;<br>"At any rate, it's been given to me to see visions of distant places and events, to hear the voices of distant people. It's as if an invisible bird perched on the wall there," he pointed at a spot on the plastered wall not far from an open window, "or on the branch of a tree, and I saw through its eyes, heard through its ears. I've never seen the future, and I can't call up the past. I see only the present, and no man can see<i> all</i> that transpires everywhere in the entire world. But the things which I have seen have focused more and more tightly upon Charis, upon your house, and upon Cayleb. I don't believe that would happen by accident."<br>&nbsp;<br>Haarahld's eyes seemed to bore into Merlin's. The King of Charis had a reputation for being able to...</p><h2>Three Scientists and Their Gods: Looking for Meaning in an Age of Information</h2><p>Examines the concepts of information, meaning, and purpose, describes the function of information at various levels of organization, and discusses the theories of Edward Fredkin, Edward O.

He&#x2019;s been dead �twenty-�five years. His name was Rex (my two brothers and I named him when we were in our early teens) and he was a bull terrier. &#x201c;An American bull terrier,&#x201d; we used to say, proudly; none of your �En�glish bulls. He had one brindle eye that sometimes made him look like a clown and sometimes reminded you of a politician with derby hat and cigar. The rest of him was white except for a brindle saddle that always seemed to be slipping off and a brindle stocking on a hind leg. Nevertheless, there was a nobility about him. He was big and muscular and beautifully made. He never lost his dignity even when trying to accomplish the extravagant tasks my brothers and myself used to set for him. One of these was the bringing of a �ten-�foot wooden rail into the yard through the back gate. We would throw it out into the alley and tell him to go get it. Rex was as powerful as a wrestler, and there were not many things that he �couldn&#x2019;t manage somehow to get hold of with his great jaws and lift or drag to wherever he wanted to put them, or wherever we wanted them put. He would catch the rail at the balance and lift it clear of the ground and trot with great confidence �toward the gate. Of course, since the gate was only four feet wide or so, he couldn&#x2019;t bring the rail in broadside. He found that out when he got a few terrific jolts, but he �wouldn&#x2019;t <br><br>give up. He finally figured out how to do it, by dragging the rail, holding onto one end, growling. He got a great, wagging satisfaction out of his work. We used to bet kids who had never seen Rex in action that he could catch a baseball thrown as high as they could throw it. He almost never let us down. Rex could hold a baseball with ease in his mouth, in one cheek, as if it were a chew of tobacco.<br><br>He was a tremendous fighter, but he never started fights. I don&#x2019;t believe he liked to get into them, despite the fact that he came from a line of fighters. He never went for another dog&#x2019;s throat but for one of its ears (that teaches a dog a lesson), and he would get his grip, close his eyes, and hold on. He could hold on for hours. His longest fight lasted from dusk until almost �pitch-�dark, one Sunday. It was fought in East Main Street in Columbus with a large, snarly, nondescript that belonged to a big colored man. When Rex finally got his ear grip, the brief whirlwind of snarling turned to screeching. It was frightening to listen to and to watch. The Negro boldly picked the dogs up somehow and began swinging them around his head, and finally let them fly like a hammer in a hammer throw, but although they landed ten feet away with a great plump, Rex still held on.<br><br>The two dogs eventually worked their way to the middle of the car tracks, and after a while two or three streetcars were held up by the fight. A motorman tried to pry Rex&#x2019;s jaws open with a switch rod; somebody lighted a fire and made a torch of a stick and held that to Rex&#x2019;s tail, but he paid no attention. In the end, all the residents and storekeepers in the neighborhood were on hand, shouting this, suggesting that. Rex&#x2019;s joy of battle, when battle was joined, was almost tranquil. He had a kind of pleasant expression during fights, not a vicious one, his eyes closed in what would have seemed to be sleep had it not been for the turmoil of the struggle. The Oak Street Fire Department finally had to be sent �for&#x2014;�I don&#x2019;t know why nobody thought of it sooner. Five or six pieces of apparatus arrived, followed by a battalion chief. A hose was attached and a powerful stream of water was turned on the dogs. Rex held on for several moments more while the torrent buffeted him about like a log in a freshet. He was a hundred yards away from where the fight started when he finally let go.<br><br>The story of that Homeric fight got all around town, and some of our relatives looked upon the incident as a blot on the family name. They insisted that we get rid of Rex, but we were very happy with him, and nobody could have made us give him up. We would have left town with him first, along any road there was to go. It would have been different, perhaps, if he had ever started fights, or looked for trouble. But he had a gentle disposition. He never bit a person in the ten strenuous years that he lived, nor ever growled at anyone except prowlers. He killed cats, that is true, but quickly and neatly and without especial malice, the way men kill certain animals. It was the only thing he did that we could never cure him of doing. He never killed, or even chased, a squirrel. I don&#x2019;t know why. He had his own philosophy about such things. He never ran barking after wagons or automobiles. He �didn&#x2019;t seem to see the idea in pursuing something you �couldn&#x2019;t catch, or something you �couldn&#x2019;t do anything with, even if you did catch it. A wagon was one of the things he �couldn&#x2019;t tug along with his mighty jaws, and he knew it. Wagons, therefore, were not a part of his world.<br><br>Swimming was his favorite recreation. The first time he ever saw a body of water (Alum Creek), he trotted nervously along the steep bank for a while, fell to barking wildly, and finally plunged in from a height of eight feet or more. I shall always remember that shining, virgin dive. Then he swam upstream and back just for the pleasure of it, like a man. It was fun to see him battle upstream against a stiff current, struggling and growling every foot of the way. He had as much fun in the water as any person I have known. You �didn&#x2019;t have to throw a stick in the water to get him to go in. Of course, he would bring back a stick to you if you did throw one in. He would even have brought back a piano if you had thrown one in.<br><br>That reminds me of the night, way after midnight, when he went �a-�roving in the light of the moon and brought back a small chest of drawers that he found �somewhere&#x2014;�how far from the house nobody ever knew; since it was Rex, it could easily have been half a mile. There were no drawers in the chest when he got it home, and it �wasn&#x2019;t a good �one&#x2014;�he �hadn&#x2019;t taken it out of anybody&#x2019;s house; it was just an old cheap piece that somebody had abandoned on a trash heap. Still, it was something he wanted, probably because it presented a nice problem in transportation. It tested his mettle. We first knew about his achievement when, deep in the night, we heard him trying to get the chest up onto the porch. It sounded as if two or three people were trying to tear the house down. We came downstairs and turned on the porch light. Rex was on the top step trying to pull the thing up, but it had caught somehow and he was just holding his own. I suppose he would have held his own till dawn if we �hadn&#x2019;t helped him. The next day we carted the chest miles away and threw it out. If we had thrown it out in a nearby alley, he would have brought it home again, as a small token of his integrity in such matters. After all, he had been taught to carry heavy wooden objects about, and he was proud of his prowess.<br><br>I am glad Rex never saw a trained police dog jump. He was just an amateur jumper himself, but the most daring and tenacious I have ever seen. He would take on any fence we pointed out to him. Six feet was easy for him, and he could do eight by making a tremendous leap and hauling himself over finally by his paws, grunting and straining; but he lived and died without knowing that twelve-� and �sixteen-�foot walls were too much for him. Frequently, after letting him try to go over one for a while, we would have to carry him home. He would never have given up trying.<br><br>There was in his world no such thing as the impossible. Even death �couldn&#x2019;t beat him down. He died, it is true, but only, as one of his admirers said, after �&#x201c;straight-�arming the death angel&#x201d; for more than an hour. Late one afternoon he wandered home, too slowly and too uncertainly to be the Rex that had trotted briskly homeward up our avenue for ten years. I think we all knew when he came through the gate that he was dying. He had apparently taken a terrible beating, probably from the owner of some dog that he had got into a fight with. His head and body were scarred. His heavy collar with the teeth marks of many a battle on it was awry; some of the big brass studs in it were sprung loose from the leather. He licked at our hands and, staggering, fell, but got up again. We could see that he was looking for someone. One of his three masters was not home. He did not get home for an hour. During that hour the bull terrier fought against death as he had fought against the cold, strong current of Alum Creek, as he had fought to climb �twelve-�foot walls. When the person he was waiting for did come through the gate, whistling, ceasing to whistle, Rex walked a few wabbly paces �toward him, touched his hand with his muzzle, and fell down again. This time he �didn&#x2019;t get up.</p><h2>Scott Foresman Reading Street Reader&#39;s and Writer&#39;s Notebook Teacher&#39;s Manual Grade 3</h2><p>Paperback SCOTT FORESMAN Reader&#39;s and Writer&#39;s Notebook Teacher&#39;s Manual Grade 3.</p><p></p><h2>Les Oeufs Verts au Jambon</h2><p><strong>THE BELOVED CLASSIC, NOW IN FRENCH!</strong><br><br>Originally published in English as <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em>, this new French translation faithfully captures Dr. Seuss' beloved story and playful rhyme. <br><p>Here is the classic tale of Sam-I-am and his creative, silly and even desperate attempts to have his "nouveau cuisine" sampled by one unadventurous critic.

Strunk and White's guidelines for good grammar and style have been discussed, debated, and occasionally even debunked...but they cannot be dismissed. </p><p> A Strunk and White devotee since high school, writer and editor Mark Garvey has long appreciated <i>Elements</i> for its character, its attitude, and its bracing good sense. The book is not only a helpful guide to creating better prose, it is also a compelling reminder of the virtues of clarity, simplicity, and truth in writing -- and an inspiring celebration of the individual voice. To tell the story of this timeless, beloved, sometimes controversial book, and the men behind it, Garvey digs deep into the Cornell University archives and the personal letters of E. B. White and his professor William Strunk Jr. </p><p> <i>Stylized</i> is a lovingly crafted history that explores <i>Elements'</i> staying power and takes us from the hallowed halls of academia to the bustling offices of <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine to the dazzling days of old Hollywood -- and into the hearts and minds of some of the most respected writers working today.</p></p><p>Mark Garvey is a twenty-year veteran of the book publishing industry, including six years at the helm of <i>Writer&#x2019;s Market </i>and years of nonfiction acquisition and development editing. His passion for <i>The Elements of Style</i> is genuine, and he often urges it on the authors who work for him&#x2014;usually to good effect.<p>&nbsp;</p><p>Mark&#x2019;s feature articles have appeared in a variety of national and regional consumer magazines, including <i>The Oxford American</i>, <i>Writer's Digest</i>, <i>Walking</i>, and <i>Guitar Player</i>. His feature writing for <i>The Oxford American</i> received an honorable mention in <i>The Best American Travel Writing 2000</i> (Houghton Mifflin).

B. WHITE<br></p> <p>C<i>ards on the table:</i> I love <i>The Elements of Style.</i> I love the idea of it; I love its execution. I love the book&#x2019;s history, and I love its attitude. I love the fact that it makes some people nuts. I love its trim size. I love the trade dress of the 1979 third edition: The authors&#x2019; last names fill the top half of the honey-mustard cover in a stocky, crimson, sans serif typeface&#x2014;as late seventies as Huggy Bear&#x2019;s hat&#x2014;with the title itself rendered in thinner, mostly serifed type, black, in the bottom half. And in the bottom right corner, reversed out white inside a black triangle is this come-on: &#x201c;With Index.&#x201d; Nice. </p><p>Over the years, I have collected multiple copies of <i>The Elements of Style</i>, though without much in the way of method or even, really, intent. I am apparently unable to pass up nicely preserved editions in used-book stores; it&#x2019;s the same sort of trouble some people face when confronted with a heretofore unseen edition of Wallace Stevens&#x2019;s <i>Harmonium</i> or a cache of Wodehouse novels&#x2014;or, for others, an unopened six-pack of Billy beer. The copy of <i>Elements</i> in my house that has seen the most action is a paperback third edition from my college years. Its yellowed pages are edged with my own marginalia, scribbled in the heat of new revelation, no doubt, but so old and so sloppily written that it&#x2019;s mostly indecipherable now. </p><p>My rarest copy is a 1959 first edition, first printing, in great condition, including a perfectly intact dust jacket (thin, elegant black and white serifed type over a background color that a kitchen-appliance manufacturer might call Harvest Gold), that I found on a cold afternoon&#x2019;s romp through Bookmans Used Books in Flagstaff, Arizona. I paid four dollars for it, an edition that I have seen marked as high as two hundred dollars elsewhere in the used-book trade. </p><p>My favorite copy, however, is from the fourteenth printing of the 1979 edition. The book is case-bound, with a vinyl-impregnated buckram cover, forest green. Its signatures are Smyth-sewn; its dust jacket is flawless, in the ochre-red-black design just described, and protected by a Mylar cover. It is a pristine edition in all respects but one: A previous owner, perhaps fighting sleep in a mid-April English class&#x2014;windows open, dogwoods in the school yard blinding white in the afternoon light, fat bees at work among the blooms&#x2014;etched his name in red block letters across the top edge of the book&#x2019;s pages: PERKINS. </p><p><i>Perkins! Are we keeping you up?</i> Sit up straight, man, and contemplate the prize you hold in your hand. Few books of this size (thin as a buttermilk pancake, six ounces waterlogged), in fact, few books of any size, have had the impact on American literary culture and thought that <i>The Elements of Style</i> has. Ounce for ounce, it has done more to establish an American ideal of good prose style than any other book or any teacher, living or dead. Its authors, William Strunk Jr. and E. B. (Elwyn Brooks) White, have joined the pantheon of twentieth-century creative duos whose names, over time, have been transformed into brands, if not movements. Think Rodgers and Hammerstein, the Wright brothers, Tracy and Hepburn, Lennon-McCartney. In fact, <i>The Elements of Style</i> is often called &#x201c;Strunk and White,&#x201d; usually run together in the pronunciation, &#x201c;strunkenwhite,&#x201d; the authors&#x2019; names forever fused, as in &#x201c;Perkins, please revisit strunkenwhite, Rule 12.&#x201d; And, as with most great duos, the names themselves are now powerful enough to conjure by. For generations the book, by its title or its authors&#x2019; names, has been widely venerated as a sure, succinct guide to the fundamentals of good writing. But there&#x2019;s more to it than that. No simple book of tips about clear writing sells in the kinds of numbers this book sells. There&#x2019;s something else going on. </p><p><i>The Elements of Style</i> as we know it today almost didn&#x2019;t happen. It took a fat slice of chance circumstance, and thirty-eight years, to draw the elements together. William Strunk Jr., a professor of English at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, self-published the first edition of the book in 1918. I have held a copy in the Cornell archives; it&#x2019;s a slight thing, only forty-three pages, with a lightly textured card-stock cover. Intended as a quick-reference guide for his students, <i>The Elements of Style</i> covered the basics of clear and clean writing&#x2014;tips on usage, composition, word choice, spelling&#x2014;and it simplified Strunk&#x2019;s task of grading papers and saved him the cost, in both time and tedium, of using valuable class time to reiterate the fundamentals. The book&#x2019;s advice was useful and accurate, it covered only the essentials, and its tone was brisk. Strunk&#x2019;s <i>Elements of Style</i> sold in the campus bookstore for twenty-five cents, and it enjoyed a respectable run at Cornell, going through several editions in Strunk&#x2019;s lifetime. One of the Cornellians plunking down his quarter in 1919 was E. B. White, a student in Strunk&#x2019;s English Usage and Style class. There were plenty of things about college young Elwyn didn&#x2019;t care for, but the future essayist, children&#x2019;s author, and voice of <i>The New Yorker</i> magazine liked this class, and he liked William Strunk. After White&#x2019;s graduation in 1921, he and Strunk remained friends, but White&#x2019;s memory of <i>The Elements of Style</i> eventually faded. </p><p>Time passed. Lots of it. E. B. White began his long career at <i>The New Yorker</i> in 1926. The Depression came and went. Collections of White&#x2019;s essays, sketches, and poems were published. World War II rolled through. White wrote and published his first book for children, <i>Stuart Little.</i> William Strunk Jr., after a forty-six-year teaching career and nine years of retirement, passed away. White published the children&#x2019;s classic <i>Charlotte&#x2019;s Web</i> and still more collected essays. Finally, in the spring of 1957, thirty-eight years after he had last laid eyes on the book, and eleven years after Strunk&#x2019;s death, White received a copy of the 1918 edition of <i>The Elements of Style</i> in the mail; it had been sent by an old college friend who thought White would find it amusing. What happened next is well known to <i>Elements</i> fans&#x2014;it&#x2019;s recounted in the introduction of every edition&#x2014;and it&#x2019;s where the story really begins. </p><p>When Paul McCartney met John Lennon, at a Quarry Men gig in Liverpool, his first impulse was to pick up a guitar and play. When White re-met <i>The Elements of Style</i> in 1957, he, too, turned to his art: He took to the typewriter to tell his readers about <i>Elements</i> and about William Strunk. In a &#x201c;Letter from the East&#x201d; column published that summer in <i>The New Yorker</i>, E. B. White wrote about the &#x201c;rich deposits of gold&#x201d; he had rediscovered in the little book and about its author, whom he recalled as friendly, funny, audacious, and self-confident. &#x201c;Will knew where he stood,&#x201d; White wrote. &#x201c;He scorned the vague, the tame, the colorless, the irresolute. He felt it was worse to be irresolute than to be wrong.&#x201d; Strunk tickled White, and White admired his old professor&#x2019;s outlook: Say what you mean, and say it clearly. </p><p>The &#x201c;Letter from the East&#x201d; caught the eye of Jack Case, a <i>New Yorker</i> reader and alert editor working in the college book department of The Macmillan Company. Immediately after reading White&#x2019;s tribute to Strunk, maybe even before finishing it, Case contacted White to say that his company was interested in publishing <i>The Elements of Style</i> and using White&#x2019;s essay as the book&#x2019;s introduction. They struck an agreement, and, over the next year, White performed a thorough overhaul and updating of Strunk&#x2019;s original text; revised his <i>New Yorker</i> essay to work as the book&#x2019;s introduction; wrote a foreword, &#x201c;A Note on This Book&#x201d;; and added a new final chapter, &#x201c;An Approach to Style.&#x201d; The result, a collaborative teacher-student effort that spanned four decades (not to mention the great divide), was Strunk and White&#x2019;s <i>The Elements of Style.</i> First published in 1959, the book vaulted the charts like &#x201c;Love Me Do&#x201d; and has hovered in the ether ever since. Before White&#x2019;s death in 1985, two more editions were published, in 1972 and 1979. The current edition, the fourth, was published in 1999. </p><p>We&#x2019;ve already seen that my tender feelings for <i>The Elements of Style</i> extend even to the physical book itself. I recognize that&#x2019;s a little peculiar. In my defense, I&#x2019;m not the first bibliophile guilty of cherishing a book nearly as much for its look and its feel in the hand as for its content. And, as I think about it, this appreciation for a book&#x2019;s shape and structure over, or aside from, its subject matter is an apt parallel to the main argument of <i>The Elements of Style</i> itself&#x2014;the idea that a clear conception of <i>form</i>, the mechanics of communicating ideas through writing, stands behind and makes possible the successful expression of intellectual <i>content.</i> The Strunk and White prescription, distilled, is this: Master the fundamentals of good form, and, assuming you have something to say, the results&#x2014;communication, style, <i>art</i>&#x2014;will take care of themselves. </p><p><i>Elements</i> enthusiasts are in large supply&#x2014;the book has sold well over 10 million copies since 1959&#x2014;and they tend to voice their praise with Strunkian directness. &#x201c;Most books about writing are filled with bullshit,&#x201d; says Stephen King in his best-selling <i>On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft.</i> &#x201c;One notable exception is <i>The Elements of Style.</i> There is little or no detectable bullshit in t...</p></p><h2>Croutons on a Cow Pie #2 (Volume II)</h2><p>This book is one of Baxter&#39;s favorites!

First serial, The Atlantic.</p><p>As the subtitle of David Quammen's <i>Monster of God: The Man-Eating Predator in the Jungles of History and the Mind</i> suggests, his fascination centers on those animals that raise human "awareness of being meat," and he likens the historic impact of these predators to modern-day car accidents: sudden, unexpected, life-changing. While his research is extraordinary--encompassing extensive field work and diverse reading on the science and lore surrounding predatory animals--Quammen's peripatetic mind jumps from history to psychology to ecology and from Africa to Russia to Australia, sometimes leaving his readers without a base camp to recuperate during the breath-taking journey. <p> His research on the lions of Gir forest in India, on the crocodiles of Northern Australia, on the bears of the Carpathian Mountains in Romania, and on the Siberian tigers of Far East Russia finds animals held in constant tension, encircled by every-expanding human populations. But Quammen doesn't oversimplify the conflicts. Often, in fact, Quammen has so much to say about competing interests that he makes several false starts before finding his true theme. Recalling his reading in the l970s literature on crocodiles in Africa, for example, Quammen abruptly jumps to a failed farming and reintroduction project begun in India before finally settling into the investigation of Northern Australia's Crocodylus Park. </p><p> These changes in geography, time, and perspective can be disorienting in a book that is already complicated by its several competing approaches. Adding to the abundance, Quammen explores human population growth projections, images of the Leviathan in the Bible, keystone species theory, the Muskrat hypothesis (the idea that the "wastage parts" of an animal species are the ones most likely to suffer predation), and the 1994 discovery of the Chauvet cave paintings. Yet Quammen, author of <i>The Soing of the Dodo</i> moves with such ease through this wilderness of ideas that even the most difficult material becomes palatable. <i>--Patrick O&#x2019;Kelley</i></p>Recipient of an Academy Award in Literature from the American Academy of Arts and Letters, <b>David Quammen</b> is the author of five acclaimed natural history titles.</p><h2>A Coal Miner&#39;s Bride: the Diary of Anetka Kaminska (Dear America)</h2><p>Sent from Poland to Pennsylvania to be married to a coal miner, thirteen-year-old Anetka lives a totally new life in a harsh environment she doesn&#39;t understand, in this latest addition to the Dear America series.</p><p>Plucky Anetka is determined to thrive in her new life in an arranged marriage to a Pennsylvania coal miner. In spite of the fact that her husband doesn't love her, his three daughters still mourn their dead mother, and she has left behind everything she knows and loves in Poland, this 13-year-old redhead rolls up her sleeves and gets down to the backbreaking business of keeping house.<p> Working conditions in the mines are horrendous and the labor movement is rumbling; nearly every day, wives watch in frightened yet resigned anticipation as the Black Maria, the "death wagon," rattles down the street to the newest widow's door. When the Black Maria shows up at Anetka's shanty just a few months after her wedding, she must dig deeper into her reserves of strength to carry on. Luckily, a young man named Leon has been patiently waiting in the wings. Their relationship is sweetly immature--until the very end, she persists in trying to convince herself she can't stand him because he teases her.</p><p> The fact that there are no real surprises in Susan Campbell Bartoletti's historical novel will not detract from readers' enjoyment of the story. The emphasis is on the historically accurate descriptions of coal mines in Lattimer, Pennsylvania, during the late 1890s. An informative author's note, photographs, notes to a coal-mining song, and even a tantalizing recipe for potato dumplings round out this fascinating portrait of a grim time in history. As with the other titles in the immensely popular Dear America series, <i>A Coal Miner's Bride</i> is written in the form of a diary. (Ages 9 and older) <i>--Emilie Coulter</i></p>The history is dramatic: in 1896 Anetka Kaminska, 13, must leave her Polish village for an arranged marriage with a coal miner in Lattimer, Pennsylvania. Her husband, who was married once before, doesn't love her, and when he's killed in a mining accident a few months after the wedding, she's left to care for his three small daughters and take in boarders to survive. The appalling working conditions in the mines are an integral part of the story and so is the labor struggle for change. Always there's the racism by "Americans" toward the "undesirable foreigners," which culminates in the Lattimer Massacre in which 19 miners are killed. The lively young union organizer, Leon Nasevich, who proves to be Anetka's true love, is just too perfect, but their teasing relationship adds romance to the grim story. The real problem with this book is the format. There's no doubt that the diary entries from the young person's viewpoint make the story immediate and accessible; but it's totally ridiculous that Anetka, who works like a mule caring for the kids and the boarders, and who regrets that she can't find a minute to write a letter to her beloved grandmother in Poland, would keep a daily diary of her life. Bartoletti's long historical note authenticates the account of the immigration, the labor struggle, the massacre, and the role of strong women. And there's a selection of photos to reinforce the history. <i>Hazel Rochman</i></p><h2>Curse of Strahd (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)</h2><p><b>Unravel the mysteries of Ravenloft� in this dread adventure for </b><br> <b>the world&#x2019;s greatest roleplaying game</b><br> <b>&nbsp;</b><br> Under raging storm clouds, the vampire Count Strahd von Zarovich stands silhouetted against the ancient walls of Castle Ravenloft.

But his contentment is disturbed when the wizard Gandalf and a company of dwarves arrive on his doorstep one day to whisk him away on an adventure. They have launched a plot to raid the treasure hoard guarded by Smaug the Magnificent, a large and very dangerous dragon. Bilbo reluctantly joins their quest, unaware that on his journey to the Lonely Mountain he will encounter both a magic ring and a frightening creature known as Gollum. <br>&nbsp; <br>Written for J.R.R. Tolkien's own children, <i>The Hobbit</i> has sold many millions of copies worldwide and established itself as a modern classic.</p></p><p><i>"In a hole in the ground there lived a hobbit. Not a nasty, dirty, wet hole, filled with the ends of worms and an oozy smell, nor yet a dry, bare, sandy hole with nothing in it to sit down on or to eat: it was a hobbit-hole, and that means comfort."</i> <p> The hobbit-hole in question belongs to one Bilbo Baggins, an upstanding member of a "little people, about half our height, and smaller than the bearded dwarves." He is, like most of his kind, well off, well fed, and best pleased when sitting by his own fire with a pipe, a glass of good beer, and a meal to look forward to. Certainly this particular hobbit is the last person one would expect to see set off on a hazardous journey; indeed, when Gandalf the Grey stops by one morning, "looking for someone to share in an adventure," Baggins fervently wishes the wizard elsewhere. No such luck, however; soon 13 fortune-seeking dwarves have arrived on the hobbit's doorstep in search of a burglar, and before he can even grab his hat or an umbrella, Bilbo Baggins is swept out his door and into a dangerous adventure.</p><p> The dwarves' goal is to return to their ancestral home in the Lonely Mountains and reclaim a stolen fortune from the dragon Smaug. Along the way, they and their reluctant companion meet giant spiders, hostile elves, ravening wolves--and, most perilous of all, a subterranean creature named Gollum from whom Bilbo wins a magical ring in a riddling contest. It is from this life-or-death game in the dark that J.R.R. Tolkien's masterwork, <i>The Lord of the Rings</i>, would eventually spring. Though <i>The Hobbit</i> is lighter in tone than the trilogy that follows, it has, like Bilbo Baggins himself, unexpected iron at its core. Don't be fooled by its fairy-tale demeanor; this is very much a story for adults, though older children will enjoy it, too.

Christopher Paolini began <i>Eragon</i> when he was just 15, and the book shows the influence of Tolkien, of course, but also Terry Brooks, Anne McCaffrey, and perhaps even Wagner in its traditional quest structure and the generally agreed-upon nature of dwarves, elves, dragons, and heroic warfare with magic swords. <p> Eragon, a young farm boy, finds a marvelous blue stone in a mystical mountain place. Before he can trade it for food to get his family through the hard winter, it hatches a beautiful sapphire-blue dragon, a race thought to be extinct. Eragon bonds with the dragon, and when his family is killed by the marauding Ra'zac, he discovers that he is the last of the Dragon Riders, fated to play a decisive part in the coming war between the human but hidden Varden, dwarves, elves, the diabolical Shades and their neanderthal Urgalls, all pitted against and allied with each other and the evil King Galbatorix. Eragon and his dragon Saphira set out to find their role, growing in magic power and understanding of the complex political situation as they endure perilous travels and sudden battles, dire wounds, capture and escape. </p><p> In spite of the engrossing action, this is not a book for the casual fantasy reader. There are 65 names of people, horses, and dragons to be remembered and lots of pseudo-Celtic places, magic words, and phrases in the Ancient Language as well as the speech of the dwarfs and the Urgalls. But the maps and glossaries help, and by the end, readers will be utterly dedicated and eager for the next book, <i>Eldest</i>. (Ages 10 to 14) <i>--Patty Campbell</i></p>Eragon is a very special book. It is a great story, one that will you'll remember long after you finish it. Eragon inspires passion in fans. We invite you to read Eragon and see for yourself what the buzz is all about. <p>Eragon was nominated for the American Library Association 2003 Best Books For Young Adults Award.</p></p><h2>Writing Broadcast News</h2><p>Thoroughly revised and greatly expanded, this new edition is even more helpful than the classic first edition.

Photographs, along with over 150 drawings from Sarah Susanka's own sketchbook, illustrate practical home design ideas for everyday living.</p><p>Not So Big Solutions for Your Home is a compilation of over 30 columns written by Sarah Susanka for Fine Homebuilding magazine.<br>-- Makes architecture and design accessible to people who are not trained in the field<br>-- Provides a wide variety of practical, accessible, everyday solutions</p></p><p>"Do more with less space" is the key concept of this down-to-earth design guide for both new home builders and remodelers. <i>Not So Big Solutions for Your Home</i> provides simplified design principles in jargon-free language for the nonprofessional contemplating a residential building project. Architect and author Sarah Susanka, well-known for 1998's <i>The Not So Big House: A Blueprint for the Way We Really Live</i>, offers advice on how to redefine space to create happier living areas that function more efficiently. For example, analyzing the family's television habits and planning set placement in advance may avert future squabbles and smooth out daily living. Thinking of each exterior door as the location of a sequence of common events (such as hauling in the groceries or taking off muddy boots) will help the planner create a neater entryway adapted to the family's specific needs. Throughout, plentiful drawings and photos illustrate simple solutions to such common problems as unused living rooms, dark bedrooms, and crowded kitchens. Readers seeking to remodel on a budget will be heartened by Susanka's contention that it is often best to stay within existing walls and avoid building out. All in all, the book provides a lot of theoretical food for thought for lay people preparing to begin the daunting task of either building a new home or remodeling an old one. <i>--Judy Fireman</i>Sarah Susanka is one of the leading residential architects in the United States.

There are eleven books in the popular series of Crinkleroot nature guides. Mr. Arnosky lives in South Reygate, Vermont.Kindergarten-Grade 3. The wise, funny, and forever endearing Crinkleroot, "explorer and wildlife finder," provides yet another guided tour through nature. In his "old jalopy" with his canoe attached and his benevolent snake in tow, he takes readers through various animal habitats. The trip begins in the wetlands, with a cross-sectioned view and an introduction to many of the species that live there. The difference between a swamp, a bog, and a marsh is clarified. Next comes a visit to a woodland, where a double-page spread invites children to find the 24 animals, including birds, squirrels, bats, and insects. Crinkleroot passes through a farmer's cornfield, the grasslands, and into the drylands to introduce succulent plants and unusual critters such as the roadrunner and the collared lizard.

In 1993 Midnight&#39;s Children was judged to be the Best of the Booker, the best novel to have won the Booker Prize in its forty year history. The Moor&#39;s Last Sigh won the Whitbread Prize in 1995 and the European Union&#39;s Aristeion Prize for Literature in 1996. He is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature and a Commandeur des Arts et des Lettres.Rushdie calls his controversial novel The Satanic Verses "a migrant's-eye view of the world," and indeed the theme of cultural transplantation informs many of the 75 essays and reviews gathered in this impressive collection. Whether he is analyzing racial prejudice in Britain or surveying an India riven by fundamentalism and politics of religious hatred, he writes as an impartial observer, a citizen of the world. Subtle and witty, these concise, eloquent pieces are a pleasure to read. Rushdie's wide-ranging sympathies range from Grace Paley's stories to Thomas Pynchon's political allegories. He situates such writers as Gunter Grass, John le Carre and Mario Vargas Llosa in a political context. Along with a devastating review of the movie Gandhi and a withering portrayal of Margaret Thatcher's class-ridden, jingoist Britain, there are two resounding replies (both written last year) to critics of The Satanic Verses : Rushdie explains the book's intentions and defends the freedom of the writer. <br>Copyright 1991 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Bourne Identity (Bourne Trilogy No.1)</h2><p><b>Jason Bourne. </b><br><br>He has no past.

Includes brief background information.</p><p>Grade 3 Up-Baynes takes this fundamental statement of Christian doctrine line by line and points to its organizing narrative and its role in the world. Framed by ebullient leaves, flames, mandorlas, jambs, and arches, miniature vignettes of the birth, death, and resurrection of Jesus are linked to Church icons and rituals, and scenes of abundant nature, daily life, and the coming Judgment. However, Baynes portrays the world of faith as if she were a giddy Gothic illuminator. Her palette, with its slightly acid greens and dusty pink and gray, says "today." The pleasures of this work lie in the clever mimicry of medieval style, the delights of design, and the rewards of hunting through the exuberant faux-capitals for the hidden animals, symbols, architectural elements, and humans. Baynes knows when to stop: this is not a Book of Kells labyrinth, but a clear celebration of the pre-Renaissance world and its gift of faith.<br><i>Patricia D. Lothrop, St. George's School, Newport, RI</i><br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.Gr. 1-3. Baynes, best known for illustrating the Narnia series, visually interprets the Nicene Creed, a statement of Christian beliefs written in 325 C.E and used by Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox, and most Protestant churches today. To children who hear a modern translation of the creed in church every Sunday, the traditional version used here may sound a little different, but not enough to be confusing. The last page of text gives some history of the Nicene Creed. The artwork is imaginative and energetic as well as reverent. Reminiscent of illuminated manuscripts, the richly colored illustrations frame phrases from the creed with formal compositions, which are softened by sweeping lines of trees, flowers, and flowing water. Within the designs are small scenes from Christian stories and church history as well as odd little details featuring creatures such as spiders, birds, fish, dragons, and, yes, devils. <i>Carolyn Phelan</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

I came up from miles below the surface and opened an eye as one part of my brain tried to work out what had disturbed me and another part focused on how to make the noise stop. It resolved into a low rattle that was my phone vibrating crossly on the bedside table along with the high-pitched shrill of the most annoying ring tone I could have chosen. Fumbling for it in the dark, I sideswiped it and managed to push it off the table. It fell face down in the carpet, still ringing, the sound now slightly muffled. I&#x2019;d winged it but not killed it. The bonus was that now it was a little bit harder to reach. I leaned out of bed at a dangerous angle, raking the carpet with my fingers, trying to get to it.</p><p>&#x2018;Mmph!&#x2019;</p><p>Most of the nuance was lost in the pillow, but I interpreted Ian&#x2019;s comment as &#x2018;answer the fucking phone&#x2019;, which was pretty much what I was thinking myself. Along <i>with what time is it</i>? and <i>what does this eejit want</i>?</p><p>I got it at last and stabbed at the buttons until it stopped making a noise, trying to read the screen. LANGTON. Rob. I squinted at the time and read 03.27. Half past three in the morning and Detective Constable Rob Langton was calling me. I was waking up now, my brain starting to crank into gear, but my mouth hadn&#x2019;t caught up with the change of plans and was still slack with sleep. When I said hello, it sounded slurred, as if I&#x2019;d been drinking for the last&#x2014;I worked it out&#x2014;three and a half hours instead of having some much-needed shut-eye. Three and a half hours. That made six hours of sleep in the last forty-eight. I squeezed my eyes closed and wished I hadn&#x2019;t added it up. Somehow, knowing the numbers made me feel worse.</p><p>&#x2018;Did I wake you, Kerrigan?&#x2019; I would have recognised the Manchester twang anywhere.</p><p>&#x2018;You know you did. What do you want?&#x2019;</p><p>I asked, but I already knew. There were only two reasons why Rob Langton would be ringing me at that hour of the morning sounding excited. One: there was another body. Two: they&#x2019;d caught the killer. Either way, I wasn&#x2019;t going back to sleep any time soon.</p><p>&#x2018;Got him.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;No way.&#x2019; I sat up in bed and put the light on, ignoring a groan from beside me and squinting as I tried to concentrate. &#x2018;Where? How?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We had a bit of help. Nice young lady out on the beers with a bladed article didn&#x2019;t take kindly to being next on the Burning Man&#x2019;s list.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;He&#x2019;s not dead.&#x2019; My heart was pounding. If he was dead, that was it. No answers. No trial.</p><p>No justice.</p><p>&#x2018;Nah, he&#x2019;s clinging on. He&#x2019;s in hospital. In surgery, at the minute. Two stab wounds to the abdomen; she lacerated his bowel.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Ouch.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, couldn&#x2019;t happen to a nicer person.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Anyone we know?&#x2019; I rubbed my eyes with the heel of my hand and tried not to yawn.</p><p>&#x2018;Not known at all. Never been arrested before, and he hadn&#x2019;t come up in this enquiry.&#x2019;</p><p>I sighed. That wasn&#x2019;t great news. We hadn&#x2019;t even been close to catching him, then. We&#x2019;d just been lucky. Though the girl had been luckier still. I wasn&#x2019;t a fan of people wandering around carrying knives, but I&#x2019;d seen enough dead women in the past few weeks to think it wasn&#x2019;t such a bad idea.</p><p>&#x2018;His name&#x2019;s Vic Blackstaff. He had all his documents on him&#x2014;driver&#x2019;s licence, work ID. He&#x2019;s in his mid-fifties, does shift work for a call centre in Epsom. Lives in Peckham. Drives through south-west London to get home in the small hours of the morning. Plenty of opportunity.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Older than we&#x2019;d thought,&#x2019; I commented. &#x2018;Shift work fits, though. Where did it happen?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Richmond.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s quite a long way out of the usual area. Up to now he&#x2019;s stuck to Kennington, Stockwell&#x2014;nowhere as far out as Richmond.&#x2019; I was frowning.</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, but his usual area is flooded with uniforms. Makes sense that he would be hunting elsewhere, doesn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; Rob sounded confident and I gave a mental shrug; who was I to second-guess a serial killer?</p><p>&#x2018;They&#x2019;re going through his car at the moment,&#x2019; Rob went on. &#x2018;We&#x2019;re waiting at the hospital.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Who&#x2019;s we?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Me and the boss. And DI Judd, unfortunately. We&#x2019;ll be interviewing the young lady as soon as the doctors tell us we can talk to her. She&#x2019;s still being checked out.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;How is she? Is she&#x2014;&#x2019;</p><p>I didn&#x2019;t want to fill in the rest of the sentence. Is she going to make it? Is she badly beaten? Is she burned? How far had he got?</p><p>&#x2018;She&#x2019;s fine. Shaken up. Nothing wrong with her but we haven&#x2019;t been allowed in to see her yet. She says she&#x2019;s not ready.&#x2019; Rob sounded impatient, which nettled me. Why shouldn&#x2019;t she take her time before speaking to the police? She&#x2019;d had a shock. What she needed was a sympathetic ear. And I was the ideal person to provide it. Energy flooded through my limbs, adrenalin pushing fatigue into a corner, to be ignored until I had time to give in to it again. Three hours&#x2019; sleep was plenty. I was already out of bed, making for the door, stumbling on rubbery legs that ached as if I&#x2019;d run a marathon the day before.</p><p>&#x2018;Well, I&#x2019;ll be there soon. Maybe they&#x2019;ll let me talk to her.&#x2019; The perks of being the only woman in Superintendent Godley&#x2019;s inner circle were not legion, but now and then it came in handy.</p><p>&#x2018;Why doesn&#x2019;t that surprise me? Nought to sixty in ten minutes, that&#x2019;s you.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;That&#x2019;s why you phoned me, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x2019; I was in the bathroom now, and debated whether I could risk peeing while on the phone. He&#x2019;d hear. I&#x2019;d have to wait.</p><p>&#x2018;I knew you&#x2019;d want to be here.&#x2019; That was only half the story; it suited them all for me to be there. I could hear Rob grinning; he was a smug git sometimes, but I could forgive him, because when all was said and done, I did want to be there, and without a call from him, I wouldn&#x2019;t have known a thing about it until I&#x2019;d seen it on the news.</p><p>&#x2018;Which hospital?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Kingston.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll be there in half an hour,&#x2019; I said before I&#x2019;d thought about it properly. It was a long way from Primrose Hill to Kingston and I desperately needed a shower. My hair was sticking to my head. There was no way I was leaving with dirty hair. Not again. &#x2018;Make that forty minutes.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;We&#x2019;re in the ICU. Phones off, so ring the hospital if you need us.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Will do.&#x2019;</p><p>I flicked the water on before going to the loo, but even so, it wasn&#x2019;t even close to warm enough when I forced myself to step into the slate-lined shower area, wincing as the spray hit my goose-pimpled skin. The showerhead was the size of a dinner plate and pumped out rain-forest levels of water; it was just a shame that it never got hot enough for me. Style over substance, as usual. But it wasn&#x2019;t my flat so I couldn&#x2019;t really complain. I was sharing it, officially, but I felt more like a guest. And not necessarily a welcome one, at times.</p><p>I had balled my hands together under my chin, hugging body heat to myself, and it was an effort to unknot my fingers and reach for the shampoo once the water started to approach tepidity. Haste made me fumble the shampoo cap and I swore as I heard it skitter around the sloping tiles that led to the drain. I left it there, hearing my mother&#x2019;s voice in my head, <i>sure, it can&#x2019;t fall any further</i>...Two minutes later, I stepped on it and had to muffle a yelp in the crook of my elbow as a sharp edge dug into the arch of my foot. Swearing was a help. I swore. A lot.</p><p>I scrubbed at my scalp until the muscles in my forearms complained and rinsed my hair for as long as I could allow myself to, eyes closed against the lather that slid down my face. Bliss to be clean again, joy to know that the case was coming to an end. I wanted to stay in there for ever with my eyes closed; I wanted to sleep&#x2014;how I wanted to sleep. But I couldn&#x2019;t. I had to get going. And by the time I got out of the shower, I was what passed for awake these days.</p><p>Back in the bedroom, I tried to be quiet, but I couldn&#x2019;t help rattling the hangers in the wardrobe when I was taking out a suit. I heard stirring behind me in the bed and bit my lip.</p><p>&#x2018;What&#x2019;s up?&#x2019;</p><p>I wouldn&#x2019;t have spoken to Ian if he hadn&#x2019;t spoken to me; that was the rule I observed about getting up and leaving in the middle of the night. Not that I was sure he&#x2019;d ever noticed there was a rule.</p><p>&#x2018;Going to meet a murderer.&#x2019;</p><p>That earned me an opened eye. &#x2018;You got him. Well done.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;It wasn&#x2019;t exactly all my own work, but thanks.&#x2019;</p><p>He rolled over onto his back and threw an arm over his face, shielding his eyes from the light. He was in his natural position now, hogging the middle of the bed. I suppressed the impulse to push him back onto his own side and hauled the sheet up instead, tucking him in. <i>Look, I care about you. See how thoughtful I am.</i></p><p>&#x2018;Mmm,&#x2019; was the response. He was on his way back to sleep. I slipped the dry-cleaner&#x2019;s bag off my suit and balled it up, squashing it into the bin. I should have taken it off sooner. The suit smelled of chemicals and I wrinkled my nose, reluctant to put it on. The forecast was for a cold day, and rain. I thought longingly of jeans tucked into boots, of chunky jumpers and long knitted scarves. God, dressing like a grown-up was a pain.</p><p>I sat on the edge of the bed to deal with my tights, coaxing them over damp skin, wary of ripping them. My hair dripped onto my shoulders, cold water running down my back. I hadn&#x2019;t got time for this. I hadn&#x2019;t got time for immaculate. Slowly, infinitely slowly, I worked the material up over my thighs and stood to haul the tights the rest of the way. It was not the most elegant moment of getting dressed, and I wasn&#x2019;t pleased to turn and find Ian staring at me, an unreadable expression on his face.</p><p>&#x2018;So is this it?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What do you mean?&#x2019; I slipped on a shirt, then stepped into my skirt, zipping it up quickly and smoothing it over my hips. That was better. More dignified. The waistband was loose, I noticed, the skirt hanging from my hips rather than my waist. It took the hem from on the knee to over it, from flattering to frump. I needed to eat more. I needed to rest.</p><p>&#x2018;I mean is this the end of it? Are you going to be around more?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Probably. Not for a little while&#x2014;we&#x2019;ve got to sort out the paperwork and get the case ready for the CPS. But after that, yeah.&#x2019;</p><p><i>If there isn&#x2019;t another serial killer waiting to take over from where the Burning Man left off. If nothing else goes wrong between now and Christmas. If all the criminals in London take the rest of the year off.</i></p><p>I was looking for shoes, my medium-heeled courts that didn&#x2019;t so much as nod to fashion but hey, I could wear them from now until midnight without a twinge of complaint from my feet. I could even run in them if I had to. One was in the corner of the room, where I&#x2019;d kicked it off. The other I eventually found under the bed, and had to sprawl inelegantly to retrieve it.</p><p>&#x2018;I hate the way they whistle and you come running.&#x2019; He sounded wide awake now, and cross. My heart sank.</p><p>&#x2018;It&#x2019;s my job.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Oh, it&#x2019;s your <i>job</i>. Sorry. I didn&#x2019;t realise.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Don&#x2019;t do this now,&#x2019; I said, stabbing my feet into my shoes and grabbing my towel. &#x2018;I&#x2019;ve got to go. It&#x2019;s important and you know it.&#x2019;</p><p>He&#x2019;d sat up, leaning on one elbow, blue eyes hostile under thick eyebrows, his brown hair uncharacteristically untidy. &#x2018;What I know is that I haven&#x2019;t seen you for weeks. What I know is that I&#x2019;ll be ringing up Camilla to say you can&#x2019;t come to supper after all, and is that OK, and I&#x2019;m really sorry if it&#x2019;s mucked up her seating arrangement. What I know is that your job always seems to come first.&#x2019;</p><p>I let him rant, towelling most of the water out of my hair and then dragging a comb through it, trying to get it into some sort of order. No time to dry it; it would dry on the way to the hospital. A few wisps, a lighter brown than the rest, were already curling around my face.</p><p>&#x2018;Camilla works in an art gallery. She has nothing to do all day but rearrange the seating plan for her little dinner parties. It&#x2019;ll be a challenge for her.&#x2019;</p><p>He flopped back down and stared at the ceiling. &#x2018;You always do that.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;What?&#x2019; I shouldn&#x2019;t have asked.</p><p>&#x2018;Put down my friends because their jobs aren&#x2019;t as important or as worthwhile as yours.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;For God&#x2019;s sake...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Not everyone wants to save the world, Maeve.&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Yeah, it&#x2019;s just as important to make it look nice,&#x2019; I snapped, and regretted it as soon as I&#x2019;d said it. Camilla was sweet, sincere, a wide-eyed innocent that brought out the protective instinct in everyone who knew her, including me. Usually. The sharpness in my voice had been partly exhaustion and partly guilt; I <i>had</i> been thinking of skipping the dinner party she was throwing. It wasn&#x2019;t that I didn&#x2019;t like Ian&#x2019;s friends&#x2014;it was just that I couldn&#x2019;t stand the questions. <i>Any interesting cases lately? Why haven&#x2019;t you caught the Burning Man yet? What&#x2019;s the most hideous thing you&#x2019;ve ever seen on duty? Do you wish they still had capital punishment? Can you sort out this speeding ticket for me?</i> It was tedious and predictable and I found it acutely embarrassing to represent the Metropolitan Police to Ian&#x2019;s friends. I was just one person. And traffic tickets were definitely outside my purview.</p><p>&#x2018;Ian...&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Aren&#x2019;t you in a hurry?&#x2019;</p><p>I checked my watch. &#x2018;Yes. Let&#x2019;s talk about this later, OK?&#x2019;</p><p>&#x2018;Can&#x2019;t wait.&#x2019;</p><p>I wanted to point out that I hadn&#x2019;t brought it up in the first place. Instead, I leaned across the bed and planted a kiss on the bit of Ian&#x2019;s chin I could reach easily. There was no response. With a sigh, I headed to the kitchen to pick up a banana, then grabbed my bag and my coat and ran down the stairs. I closed the front door with the key in the lock so I didn&#x2019;t wake the neighbours, though if they&#x2019;d slept through my shower and relationship issues, they probably wouldn&#x2019;t notice the door banging. If they were at home, and not on a pre-Christmas shopping trip to New York or a winter break in the Bahamas.</p><p>I stopped for a second on the doorstep, head down, my mind whirling.</p><p>&#x2018;What am I doing? What the hell am I doing?&#x2019;</p><p>I hadn&#x2019;t meant to say it out loud, and I wasn&#x2019;t talking about work. I could handle work. My boyfriend was another matter. We&#x2019;d been together for eight months, lived together for six, and from the moment I&#x2019;d moved into Ian&#x2019;s place, the fighting had started. I&#x2019;d fallen for a big smile, broad shoulders and a job that had nothing to do with crime. He&#x2019;d told me he liked the dynamic, busy detective with long legs and no ulterior motives. I wasn&#x2019;t looking for a husband who could be the father to my children&#x2014;yet. My eyes didn&#x2019;t light up with pound signs when I heard he was in banking. It was all so easy. We saw one another when we could, snatched hours in bed at his place or mine, managed dinner together every so often and when my lease came up for renewal, Ian had taken a chance, the sort of gamble that had made him rich, and invited me to move in with him in his ludicrously over-designed, expensive flat in Primrose Hill. It hadn&#x2019;t been a good idea. It had been a disaster. And I wasn&#x2019;t sure how to get out of it. After two months, we hadn&#x2019;t known one another, except in the biblical sense. We hadn&#x2019;t worked out what we had in common, or how we might spend long winter afternoons when the weather made going out an unappealing prospect. As it turned out, we stayed in bed or we fought. There was no middle ground. I started to stay longer at work, left earlier in the morning, popped into the nick over the weekend even if I wasn&#x2019;t on duty. The only silver lining was the overtime pay.</p><p>The night air was harsh and I shivered as I hurried down the road, my hair cold against my neck. I was glad of the coat Ian had bought me, full-length and caramel-coloured in fine wool that was really too nice for ...</p></p><h2>Dear Friend, from My Life I Write to You in Your Life</h2><p><b>In her first memoir, award-winning novelist Yiyun Li offers a journey of recovery through literature: a letter from a writer to like-minded readers.</b><br><br> <b>&#x201c;A meditation on the fact that literature itself lives and gives life.&#x201d;&#x2014;Marilynne Robinson, author of <i>Gilead</i></b><br><br><i>&#x201c;What a long way it is from one life to another, yet why write if not for that distance?&#x201d;</i><br><br>Startlingly original and shining with quiet wisdom, this is a luminous account of a life lived with books.

I duly followed their advice&#x2014;� I had an anthropologist&#x2019;s fascination with America then. I had never seen a glossy magazine, and the print and paper quality, not to mention the trove of perfumes waiting to be unfolded, made me wonder how the economics of the magazine worked, considering I paid no more than a dollar for an issue.<br><br>My favorite column was on the last page of the magazine, and it featured celebrity makeovers&#x2014;�hairstyle and hair color, for instance&#x2014;�with two bubbles signifying before and after. I didn&#x2019;t often have an opinion about the transformation, but I liked the definitiveness of that phrase, before and after, with nothing muddling the in-between.<br><br>After years of living in America, I still feel a momentary elation whenever I see advertisements for weight-�loss programs, teeth-�whitening strips, hair-�loss treatments, or plastic surgery with the contrasting effects shown under before and after. The certainty in that pronouncement&#x2014;�for each unfortunate or inconvenient situation, there is a solution to make it no longer be&#x2014;�both attracts and perplexes me. Life can be reset, it seems to say; time can be separated. But that logic appears to me as unlikely as traveling to another place to become a different person. Altered sceneries are at best distractions, or else new settings for old habits. What one carries from one point to another, geographically or temporally, is one&#x2019;s self. Even the most inconsistent person is consistently himself.<br><br>2.<br><br>I was leaving to teach class when an acquaintance who lived across the country in New Hampshire called my office. She had traveled to a nearby city. I talked to her for no more than two minutes before telling my husband to go find her. He spent twelve hours with her, canceled her business appointments, and saw to it that she flew back home. Two weeks later her husband called and said she had jumped out of her office on a Sunday evening. He asked me to attend her memorial service. I thought for a long time and decided not to.<br><br>Our memories tell more about now than then. Doubtless the past is real. There is no shortage of evidence: photos, journals, letters, old suitcases. But we choose and discard from an abundance of evidence what suits us at the moment. There are many ways to carry the past with us: to romanticize it, to invalidate it, to furnish it with revised or entirely fictionalized memories. The present does not surrender so easily to manipulation.<br><br>I don&#x2019;t want the present to judge the past, so I don&#x2019;t want to ponder my absence at her memorial service. We had come to this country around the same time. When I told her that I was going to quit science to become a writer, she seemed curious, but her husband said that it was a grave mistake. Why do you want to make your life difficult? he asked.<br><br>3.<br><br>I have had a troublesome relationship with time. The past I cannot trust because it could be tainted by my memory. The future is hypothetical and should be treated with caution. The present&#x2014;�what is the present but a constant test: in this muddled in-�between one struggles to understand what about oneself has to be changed, what accepted, what preserved. Unless the right actions are taken, one seems never to pass the test to reach the after.<br><br>4.<br><br>After the second of two hospital stays following a difficult time, I went to a program for those whose lives have fallen apart. Often someone would say&#x2014;�weeping, shaking, or dry eyed&#x2014;�that he or she wished to go back in time and make everything right again.<br><br>I wished, too, that life could be reset, but reset from when? From each point I could go to an earlier point: warning signs neglected, mistakes aggregated, but it was useless to do so, as I often ended up with the violent wish that I had never been born.<br><br>I was quiet most of the time, until I was told I was evasive and not making progress. But my pain was my private matter, I thought; if I could understand and articulate my problems I wouldn&#x2019;t have been there in the first place.<br><br>Do you want to share anything, I was prompted when I had little to offer. By then I felt my hope had run out. I saw the revolving door admitting new people and letting old people out into the world; similar stories were told with the same remorse and despair; the lectures were on the third repeat. What if I were stuck forever in that basement room? I broke down and could feel a collective sigh: my tears seemed to prove that finally I intended to cooperate.<br><br>I had only wanted to stay invisible, but there as elsewhere invisibility is a luxury.<br><br>5.<br><br>I have been asked throughout my life: What are you hiding? I don&#x2019;t know what I am hiding, and the more I try to deny it, the less trustworthy people find me. My mother used to comment on my stealthiness to our guests. A woman in charge of admission at the public bathhouse often confronted me, asking what I was hiding from her. Nothing, I said, and she would say she could tell from my eyes that I was lying.<br><br>Reticence is a natural state. It is not hiding. People don&#x2019;t show themselves equally and easily to all. Reticence doesn&#x2019;t make one feel lonely as hiding does, yet it distances and invalidates others.<br><br>6.<br><br>There are five time zones in China, but the nation uses a unified time&#x2014;�Beijing time. When the hour turns, all radio stations sound six beeps, followed by a solemn announcement: &#x201c;At the last beep, it is Beijing time seven o&#x2019;clock sharp.&#x201d; This memory is reliable because it does not belong to me but to generations of Chinese people, millions of us: every hour, the beeping and the announcement were amplified through loudspeakers in every People&#x2019;s Commune, school, army camp, and apartment complex.<br><br>But underneath this steadfastness, time is both intrusive and elusive. It does not leave us alone even in our most private moments. In every thought and feeling about life, time claims a space. When we speak of indecision, we are unwilling to let go of a present. When we speak of moving on&#x2014;�what a triumphant phrase&#x2014;�we are cutting off the past. And if one seeks kindness from time, it slips away tauntingly, or worse, with indifference. How many among us have said that to others or to ourselves: if only I had a bit more time . . .<br><br>7.<br><br>One hides something for two reasons: either one feels protective of it or one feels ashamed of it. And it is not always the case that the two possibilities can be separated. If my relationship with time is difficult, if time is intrusive and elusive, could it be that I am only hiding myself from time?<br><br>I used to write from midnight to four o&#x2019;clock. I had young children then, various jobs (from working with mice to working with cadaver tissue to teaching writing), and an ambition to keep writing separate from my real life. When most people were being ferried across the night by sleep, unaware of time, unaware of weather, I felt the luxury of living on the cusp of reality.<br><br>Night for those sound sleepers was a cocoon against time. For me, I wanted to believe, it was even better. Time, at night, was my possession, not the other way around.<br><br>8.<br><br>A friend came to see me when I visited Beijing in 2008. We talked about her real estate investments and our old schoolmates. Half an hour after she left my parents&#x2019; apartment, she called. She hadn&#x2019;t wanted to mention it in person, but a boy who had been close to me when we were teenagers had committed suicide, along with a lover.<br><br>My first reaction was wonderment, that my friend would wait until we were out of each other&#x2019;s sight to tell me. My next reaction was still wonderment, as though I had always been waiting for this news.<br><br>Our dead friend had had an affair, and both he and the woman had gone through difficult divorces only to be ostracized as adulterers.<br><br>It&#x2019;d have been better had he gone to America, my friend said.<br><br>-- Michael Kingcaid Project Portfolio Manager and Book Developer Scribe Inc. www.scribenet.com<br><br>main telephone: 215-336-5094 direct telephone: 267-507-1316 facsimile: 215-336-5092<br><br>7540 Windsor Drive Suite 200B, Allentown, PA 18195</p><h2>Icon and Devotion: Sacred Spaces in Imperial Russia</h2><p><i>Icon and Devotion</i> offers the first extensive presentation in English of the making and meaning of Russian icons. The craft of icon-making is set into the context of forms of worship that emerged in the Russian Orthodox Church in the mid-seventeenth century. Oleg Tarasov shows how icons have held a special place in Russian consciousness because they represented idealized images of Holy Russia. He also looks closely at how and why icons were made. Wonder-working saints and the leaders of such religious schisms as the Old Believers appear in these pages, which are illustrated with miniature paintings, lithographs and engravings never before published in the English-speaking world.<br><br>By tracing the artistic vocabulary, techniques and working methods of icon painters, Tarasov shows how icons have been integral to the history of Russian art, influenced by folk and mainstream currents alike. As well as articulating the specifically Russian piety they invoke, he analyzes the significance of icons in the cultural life of modern Russia in the context of popular prints and poster design.</p><p><b>Oleg Tarasov</b> is Senior Research Fellow in the Department of Cultural History of the Institute of Slavic Studies (Russian Academy of Sciences), Moscow. He has written extensively on icons, painting and cultural history. <br>&#x201c;Richly illustrated, making available much popular iconographic material generally unfamiliar to Western readers. . . .

Both a calendar of daily rituals and a witty sequence of stories recounted in a variety of styles, it weaves together tales of gods and citizens together to explore Rome's history, religious beliefs and traditions. It may also be read as a subtle but powerful political manifesto which derides Augustus' attempts to control his subjects by imposing his own mythology upon them: after celebrating the emperor as a Jupiter-on-earth, for example, Ovid deliberately juxtaposes a story showing the king of the gods as a savage rapist. Endlessly playful, this is also a work of integrity and courage, and a superb climax to the life of one of Rome's greatest writers.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700&nbsp;titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the&nbsp;series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date&nbsp;translations by award-winning translators.</p><p>Book IV of Ovid&#39;s celebration of the calendar and the associated legends of the Roman year treats the month of April, a particularly happy phase of the Augustan ceremonial year. Around the festival of Venus and the anniversary of the foundation of Rome Ovid retells the legends of Rome&#39;s royal found Romulus and the Trojan hero Aeneas. The introduction and commentary pay special attention to Ovid&#39;s art as a poet, but aim to provide both the general background and specific explanations of his historical and religious material.Ovid&#39;s Fasti, begun in or soon after AD I, was to have celebrated the calendar and associated legends of the Roman year, but probably had reached no further than June before his exile in AD 8. Book IV, the book of April, honours the festivals of Venus, Cybele, Ceres and their cult, as well as the traditional date of the foundation of Rome and many religious and civic anniversaries. Elaine Fantham accompanies her commentary with a revised text and a deliberately extended introduction. Besides including surveys of language, style, versification and textual transmission, the introduction looks at the shifting generic traditions of Greek and Roman elegy, and situates Ovid&#39;s composite poem in its Augustan literary and historical context.</p><h2>Mickey's Gourmet Cookbook: Most Popular Recipes From Walt Disney World &amp; Disneyland</h2><p>Gathers recipes for appetizers, soups, breads, salads, eggs, seafood, poultry, meats, vegetables, desserts, and sauces served at Disneyland and Walt Disney World</p><p>Gathered from Disney theme parks and vacation hotels in Canada, Europe, Mexico, Japan, the U.K., the Caribbean and even further afield, the recipes here are fairly basic, and the directions are briskly minimal. So if you have a favorite haunt from your recent holidays, you'll probably be able to reconjure some of the fare from there by paging through this. Although the recipes are organized by genre (poultry; breads), a restaurant index provides easy access to remembered hot spots. As for the food if you haven't toured a Disney resort: it may disappoint in this intercontinental but still fairly no-frills assortment. What makes the "Contemporary French Toast" contemporary, for instance? The suggested sourdough bread, perhaps; use of cinnamon; optional syrup, butter; but that's about it. Recipes do not necessarily address health concerns. For a four-person serving, would fat-conscious Americans be likely to down a fettucine dish that called for four cups of heavy cream and two cups of grated cheese, as well as lobster meat? It's up to us. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.Most probably, many libraries will rush to buy a copy of Disney's make-at-home edibles just to satisfy patron demand. Yet once the cookbook of more than 350 recipes is perused, there may be a feeling of "Is that all?" Why? Certainly not because of the dishes included; the selection is enough to satisfy even the most persnickety of tastes. But there's no narrative about the foodstuffs, no blurbs about origins, and no text about the magical mouse and his compatriots. Walt Disney's favorite recipes are credited by one line. <i>Barbara Jacobs</i></p><h2>Tsubasa: Reservoir Chronicle, Vol. 6</h2><p>BE CAREFUL WHEN THE SUN GOES DOWN!<br><br>Syaoran, Sakura, and their companions travel to �to, a country where cherry blossoms perfume the days and demons called Oni terrorize the nights.

No, no, no. Why, in those pants, with the light behind you, you look positively willowy. But even if you were large enough to have a gravitational field involving four independent moons, and I happened to notice this (unlikely, since I'm completely blinded by the solar glare of my own self-consciousness), I would never, ever ask you a question as cruel as this chapter title. Nor would you say such a thing to me, were the tables turned. No, you're only that rude and nasty to the one person you can never escape--yourself.<br><br>How many times have you accused yourself of excessive heft and inappropriate texture (squishy)? How many times have you asked, "Why am I so damn fat?" I'd try to estimate the number for myself, but I don't think it's possible to count that high. I think that if I programmed my computer to calculate the answer, it would explode.<br><br>Anyway, it doesn't matter, because pretty much everyone who asks the question "Why am I so damn fat?" already knows the answer. After all, it's in every magazine and about half the books ever published. While the details of each diet or exercise regimen vary from publication to publication, the basic message of all the vast literature on weight loss is . . . drum roll . . . wait for it . . . this is so exciting . . .<br><br>EAT LESS. MOVE MORE.<br><br>You're so damn fat because you eat too much and don't exercise enough, right? If you don't already know this, you and I aren't living in the same universe. We've been pelted with weight-loss instruction from the womb. Some of my friends had parents who offered to pay them for every �d they lost--when they were only in second grade. Some were weighed like livestock every morning in front of their families or classmates, but without the merciful follow-up of being immediately slaughtered. Some have circumnavigated the globe, one treadmill session at a time. Some actually paid to have their own jaws wired shut, like volunteer subjects in some barbaric Nazi experiment.<br><br>None of these people--not one--is ignorant of the basic principles of weight loss. They're some of the most intelligent, disciplined achievers I've ever met. All of them know many ways to eat less and move more. Is the problem that they lack willpower? Not at all--their willpower is above average. If you've ever stayed on a diet long enough to lose weight, so is yours. No, the problem, for my friends and all the rest of us, isn't that we don't know what to do. The problem is that we don't do what we know. Why not? Contrary to conventional wisdom, the most compelling answer is not in our refrigerators, our restaurants, our mouths, our stomachs, our weak wills, or our basically vile and godless natures. It's in our heads.<br><br>THINKING OURSELVES FAT<br><br>To get more than a few �ds over our healthiest weight, most of us have to eat more than our bodies really want. True, certain foods make us prone to overeating (dietitians have now proven, in laboratory experiments, that high-fructose corn syrup is the sweat of Satan). But even so, taking in far more calories than we need doesn't physically feel good. After the point when our appetites are sated, we're not increasing physical pleasure; we're overriding physical discomfort. By the same token, environmental factors may invite us to gorge, but they don't actually force us. Your local Burger Binge Bonanza managers may offer all sorts of tallow-laden food, but no one's holding you at gunpoint until you consume every last fry in a king- size super-trough.<br><br>Bottom line: Eating is a deliberate behavior, however compelling. Like all deliberate behavior, even if we do it without really thinking about it, the process of eating must be okayed by our brains before it reaches the "action" stage. I know first-hand what it's like to spend years feeling completely out of control in any area connected with food and eating. Many of my clients have been there, too. But we've also seen (and felt) what it's like to be set free from the struggle to control our weight. My experience and research tell me that these liberations didn't occur because we finally found The Right Diet or achieved superhuman willpower. They happened when we learned to operate our minds and thoughts in ways that, science has now proven, literally altered our brains. Why are you so damn fat? At the most fundamental and important level, it's because of the way your brain has been conditioned to operate--because of the way you think. And that's what this book is going to help you change.<br><br>THERE'S CHANGING YOUR MIND, AND THEN THERE'S CHANGING YOUR MIND<br><br>I reached the above conclusion after 20 years of intense study, research, and observation on the subject of weight loss. I began as an undergraduate at Harvard, trying to determine why eating disorders, so prevalent in the USA, were almost unheard of in Asia (the answer, I came to believe, isn't physiological, as much as it is philosophical--but we'll get to that later).<br><br>The reason this topic appealed to me was that, like many other college students, I had a hell of an eating disorder--and I use the word "hell" advisedly. It started as a simple diet, then morphed into an extended ride on the gain-lose-gain-lose roller coaster. In hindsight, I can see that my attempts to control my body size actually created a syndrome I now call "famine brain," which drew my behavior and attention to eating until my whole life became a struggle with food. This was one of the most horrible things I've ever experienced and is the real reason I'm writing this book. I never want another human being to feel the way I felt when bingeing, dieting, and obsessing about bingeing and dieting constituted my entire psychological universe. It was like one long, hideous visit to the Spanish Inquisition.<br><br>As I went on to get my master's and doctorate (also from Harvard, which by some tragic judgment error just kept admitting me), I became fascinated by sociobiology and social psychology, including the psychology of eating. I was particularly interested in the way the mind reacts to eating problems-- what, I wondered, was going on in the brains of people like me, people who knew exactly how to stay thin but somehow just couldn't do it? I read everything I could find on the subject. Since no one (at that time) could watch the human brain in action, the answers I found were sparse and incomplete. Still, they were better than nothing, and I began to emerge from weight obsession.<br><br>By the time I'd finished my doctorate, I had already become something that probably made my professors roll their eyes and groan: a life coach. Academia was never as exciting for me as was applying social science in the lives of real people; hearing about my clients' lives and watching them change was mesmerizing. In case you're wondering, a life coach is to a therapist as a personal trainer is to a doctor. Psychotherapists work with damaged minds to make them well. I counsel people who are mentally healthy but feel that they could do more with their lives. Since I believe that each person innately knows what his or her "best life" should be, my coaching is all about helping clients tune into their unconscious unrealized dreams, then making those dreams come true.<br><br>As I developed more and more effective coaching strategies, I noticed an interesting trend: Many of my clients were dropping excess weight, even though we hadn't talked about weight loss, and they weren't dieting. I began paying more attention to this phenomenon and even wrote a self-help book called The Joy Diet, which recommended several small lifestyle changes that I'd found were correlated with weight loss. This led to a joint project with the diet company Jenny Craig, whose wonderful, cutting-edge researchers collaborated with me in creating a DVD that helped their customers with the psychological side of weight loss.<br><br>All of these projects were fascinating, but things got even more exciting when computer technology reached a level of sophistication that allowed scientists to create "brain maps," images of the brain at work. Suddenly, scientists could literally map what was happening in the brain of a person with, say, ADD or compulsive cravings. It turns out that certain ways of thinking can literally change the structure of the brain, for example, in ways that make it less prone to craving and more prone to happiness. The implications for weight loss are huge. It's becoming increasingly evident that typical diet strategies actually tell your brain to trigger processes in the body that lead to weight gain. Happily, we can reverse that process, repair the damage, and get thin by thinking as well as behaving in specific, often counterintuitive, ways. Would you like to know what those ways are? As luck would have it, that's what this book is all about.<br><br>THE 4-DAY WIN PROGRAM<br><br>There are two ways you can use the information and strategies you'll find in this book: (1) a thorough course in thought and behavior strategies that will enable you to stay on a healthy-eating program forever with little effort; and (2) a quick fix I call the Jump-Start, which will help you start losing weight immediately. I suggest you use both strategies, though either one alone will help you lose weight. Let's look at the Jump-Start first.<br><br>THE JUMP-START: CHANGING YOUR BODY<br><br>If you turn to the Appendix of this book, which begins on page 309, you'll find a description of the basic logic behind the 4-Day Win and instructions for following a program that will start changing your body for the better right away. If you follow the program, you'll be thinner in 4 days--perhaps not as thin as you'll end up but noticeably leaner than you were at the outset. That's what adult development theorists call an "early win," and it will help motivate you to continue on the program. The first 4 days of your weight-loss routine will be the most difficult. After that, you'll experience an accelerating increase in motivation and success.<br><br>THE METAMORPHOSIS: CHANGING YOUR BRAIN<br><br>All of this is well and good, but changing your body, exciting though it is, won't be a sustainable transformation unless you also restructure your brain. If you've ever been on a diet or if you're overweight, you almost certainly have neural circuitry in your brain that's programming your body to add and hold on to fat. The astonishing fact that we can change our brains by using our minds and by behaving in new ways (some as simple as breathing differently) is the key to changing this programming. Each chapter of this book contains one or more concrete strategies for transforming yourself into a lean person from the brain outward.<br><br>To learn these skills, you could go the very long scenic route that I took: read hundreds of thousands of pages in subjects from nutrition to psychology to physics to animal behavior to philosophy to linguistic epistemology, then spend thousands of hours counseling and observing dieters. But the strategies in this book are designed to take you to Thinland quickly. Some are thought exercises that push your brain to process information in new ways. Others are real-world methods of making healthy living your second nature instead of an unsteady wagon you might fall off at any moment. Each skill is based on a great deal of research, thought, and real-world observation. Did I assemble them in one place because of my love for humanity? Partly. But mostly I did it because of a desire you'll recognize as more powerful and heartfelt: the desire to have thinner thighs.<br><br>PUTTING THE JUMP-START<br><br>AND THE METAMORPHOSIS TOGETHER<br><br>Metamorphosis takes time; caterpillars don't turn into butterflies overnight. It takes weeks to retrain your brain after a lifetime of punishing thoughts about why you're so damn fat. But I know, I know: You have that wedding next week, Uncle Earl's parole hearing right around the corner, and bikini mud wrestling season will be here before you know it-- and you want to look good. So I'll give you the best of both worlds. I'll let you leap right into the Jump-Start plan if you promise to come back and stay with me for the rest of the book. Deal?<br><br>Deal. We'll work together as if I were coaching you in person. First I'll have you implement the Jump-Start procedure, reading a few chapters to get a little basic understanding of the brain's reaction to dieting, then I'll toss you right into the motivating process of actual weight loss. Once you're losing weight, you'll read the rest of this book, absorbing the explanations and doing the exercises in each chapter. The chapters are short by design. Each one will provide an explanation for some of the problems that inevitably arise in the process of ordinary, willpower-based dieting. Then, I'll take you through an exercise designed to help you internalize the explanation, rewiring your brain and changing your psychological profile so that you'll never need to fall into the wretched, self-reinforcing cycle of typical ineffective dieting ever again.<br><br>If you think this means the 4-Day Win will give you more willpower, you're wrong; it will just help you need less. Believe it or not, your willpower is one thing that can't keep you thin. Basing a weight-loss effort on willpower does the very things to your mind and body that are virtually certain to make you fatter in the long run. The more time you spend doing traditional dieting, the more trouble you'll probably have keeping weight off, which is what makes it even more vital to undo the physical and psychological damage so that you can be thin and happy. Oh, yeah, did I mention that? If you do this program consistently, you'll end up happy, and not just because you've lost weight.<br><br>COLLATERAL BENEFITS<br><br>Of course, I know you're not a looks-obsessed dieter; you just want to be a healthy eater. And I'm certain you also watch porn purely for its sophisticated screenwriting. Let's be honest: If you could get chiseled abs by effortlessly trading in a little happiness, you'd do it in a hot second. In a recent study of 4,283 Americans, more than 600 said they'd rather give up 15 years of their lives than be fat.</p><h2>Hana-Kimi: For You in Full Blossom, Vol. 13</h2><p>Japanese-American track-and-field star Mizuki is transferring to a high school in Japan, but not just any high school!

But when a member of the town&#39;s small but growing Asian community is found dead near its beach, his neck broken, sleepy Balford-le-Nez ignites. And working solo, without her long-time partner Detective Inspector Thomas Lynley, Sergeant Barbara Havers must probe not only the mind of a murderer and a case very close to her own heart, but the terrible price people pay for deceiving others...and themselves.</p><p>In <i>Deception on His Mind</i> Sergeant Barbara Havers places herself at the center of an investigation in Essex concerning the mysterious death of a recently arrived immigrant from Pakistan. Although still recovering from the broken ribs and nose (received at the end of <i>In the Presence of the Enemy</i>), Havers convinces herself that she needs to stay on the job in order to help her neighbor Taymullah Azhar and his elfin daughter Hadiyyah who have a familial connection to the dead man. As is typical with Elizabeth George's novels (this is the 10th in a popular and powerful series), the murder and its investigation are the central feature of the story. But in this case they are also the means by which she explores the Pakistani experience in a foreign and not always friendly culture. As Havers herself notes, the food may well have improved in Britain with an increasingly diverse population, but that same population has "engendered a score of polyglot problems." Whether or not the dead man is a victim of a racially motivated crime is only one of the questions Havers tries to sort out. The result, with George's typically complex characterizations and deft plot turns, is a deeply satisfying novel. Fans of Havers's superior officer, Thomas Lynley, and his lady love Helen Clyde will be disappointed as the two are off on their honeymoon. But with Lynley out of the picture, Havers, with her prickly personality, caustic tongue, and sound investigative skills, comes well and truly into her own. Nitpickers might question one aspect of the final denouement--motive and opportunity are securely in place but the means are on the outskirts of unbelievable. Still, the book is a rich and enjoyable one that continues to tickle the imagination well after it has been shelved amidst other favorites. <i>--K.A.

On this urban planet the only relief from the overcrowding, the petty informers, and the harsh rule of the big Agencies is the television in every living space, offering dreams of vanished waterfalls and the promise of virtual vacations in green spaces for the lucky few.</p><p>It is an unwelcoming world for an orphan like Nadia Stepan, abandoned by her parents on a crowded street when she was four with only a drawing of the constellations of the Big Dipper&#x2014;Cassiopeia's Chair and the North Star&#x2014;and her mother's parting words: "Look to the North Star, and we will always be there." Shuttled from orphanage to orphanage, foster family to foster family, Nadia grows up dreaming of the vacation spot called Lighthouse Island, in a place called the Pacific Northwest where she believes her long-lost parents must be. As her obsession grows, so too does her determination to find her way there.</p><p>In the meantime, this bright and witty orphan falls into the refuge of old and neglected books; the lost world of the imagination filled with characters who can't disappear, or be arrested, or hurt her. And there is the voice, bounced from an abandoned satellite, that patiently reads, over and over, the great classical books of the world&#x2014;Big Radio, a sound in the night that lifts Nadia above the relentless television noise and the dull and perpetual Present. Despite deprivation, uncertainty, and the deceptions she must use to survive, Nadia's dream never waivers. <em>"It will get better, life will get better."</em></p><p>When an opportunity for escape appears, Nadia takes it, abandoning everything to strike out for Lighthouse Island in a dangerous and sometimes comic adventure. She faces every contingency with bottomless inventiveness and meets the man who changes the course of her life: James Orotov, a mapmaker and demolition expert. Together, they evade arrest and head north toward a place of wild beauty that lies beyond the megalopolis: Lighthouse Island and its all-seeing eye.</p><p>Paulette Jiles is a novelist, poet, and memoirist. She is the author of&nbsp;<em>Cousins</em>, a memoir, and the novels&nbsp;<em>Enemy Women, Stormy Weather, The Color of Lightning</em>, <em>Lighthouse Island</em>, and <em>News of the World</em>. She lives on a ranch near San Antonio, TX.</p></p><h2>Berenice Abbott: Changing New York</h2><p><p>Originally published by The New Press in 1997 to stellar reviews and great acclaim, <i>Berenice Abbott: Changing New York</i> sold more than 20,000 copies in its combined editions and was featured in <i>Vanity Fair, Newsweek</i>, and the<i> New York Daily News </i>and called &#x201c;the definitive visual record of the city as it was during the Depression&#x201d; by the <i>Washington Post</i>.</p><p>A Midwesterner who first came to New York in 1918, Abbott (1898&#x2013;1991) was one of the twentieth century&#x2019;s most important photographers, and her images have come to define 1930s New York.

This is followed by an account of how Frodo, Sam and Gollum were finally brought to the Pass of Kirith Ungol, at which point J.R.R. Tolkien wrote at the time: 'I have got the hero into such a fix that not even an author will be able to extricate him without labour and difficulty'. Then comes the war in Gondor, and the book ends with the parley between Gandalf and the ambassador of the Dark Lord before the Black Gate of Mordor. In describing his intentions for The Return of the King J.R.R. Tolkien said that 'It will probably work out very differently from this plan when it really gets written, as the thing seems to write itself once it gets going'; and in The War of the Ring totally unforeseen developmenst that would become central to the narrative are seen at the moment of their emergence: the palantir bursting into fragments on the stairs of Orthanc, its nature as unknown to the author as to those who saw it fall, or the entry of Faramir into the story ('I am sure I did not invent him, though I like him, but there he came walking into the woods of Ithilien').<br><br>The book is illustrated with plans and drawings of the changing conceptions of Orthanc, Dunharrow, Minas Tirith and the tunnels of Shelob's Lair.</p><p>J.R.R. Tolkien was born on January 3, 1892. After serving in the First World War, he embarked upon a distinguished career as a professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford University.

Tolkien include The Silmarillion. J.R.R. Tolkien died in 1973 at the age of 81. <p>Christopher Tolkien, who formerly taught at Oxford University, is J.R.R. Tolkien's son and literary executor.

Most people don&#x2019;t realize that deep-fried tofu tastes amazing and that Oreos are, in fact, vegan. So, even after Jasmin embraced a vegan lifestyle, having discovered her passion in advocating for the rights of animals, she defied any &#x201c;skinny vegan&#x201d; stereotypes by getting even heavier.<br> &nbsp;<br> More importantly, she realized that her compassion for animals didn&#x2019;t extend to her own body, and that her low self-esteem was affecting her health. She needed a change. By committing to monthly juice fasts and a diet of whole, unprocessed foods, Jasmin lost almost a hundred pounds, gained an understanding of her destructive relationship with food, and finally realized what it means to be truly full.<br> &nbsp;<br> Told with humble humor and heartbreaking honesty, this is Jasmin&#x2019;s story of how she went from finding solace in a box of cheese crackers to finding peace within herself.</p><p><p><b>Jasmin Singer </b>is the executive director of Our Hen House, Inc., a media hub to change the world for animals.

I wriggled my way around, trying to wedge both me and my stupid, gigantic purse into the cramped rectangle. I shimmied, did a tiny pirouette, and finally edged my pants down. It was like <i>Swan Lake</i> in there, and all so that I could successfully maneuver my 221-pound, five-foot-four self into proper peeing position.</p><p>&#x201c;This is like a goddamn gestation crate,&#x201d; I said to no one in particular, finally finding a suitable stance, but only after banging my funny bone on the sanitary napkin disposal.</p><p>A few minutes later, as small beads of sweat collected on my forehead, I washed my hands, thinking, &#x201c;Why is soap in public bathrooms always hot pink?&#x201d;</p><p>I was winded. I decided to take a moment to catch my breath. My dining mates could wait. They were probably in a tabbouleh daze by now anyway, busy working their way through the fava bean appetizer.</p><p>Oh, how I loved the food in San Francisco! Even in comparison to my own gritty city, New York&#x2014;which was just bursting with flavors and cuisines vibrant and diverse enough to keep any foodie busy (including a vegan one, like me)&#x2014;there was something about this town that made me hungry to try everything. On that night, my partner, Mariann, and I had met up with a couple of friends who knew the ins and outs of the restaurant scene in the City by the Bay. They&#x2019;d chosen a slightly gaudy, but nonetheless mouthwatering, Mediterranean restaurant in the Tenderloin district&#x2014;ironic, because we were there for its scrumptious vegan menu. The only tenderloins in our lives were made out of wheat gluten.</p><p>Just before I excused myself to go to the bathroom, my friends John and Cassie had been telling Mariann and me (but mainly me) about a new documentary, <i>Fat, Sick &amp; Nearly Dead</i>, set to be released the following spring. John and Cassie worked in magazine publishing and had been given an advance press copy.</p><p>They told us that the film was about a man who juice fasted for sixty days in an effort to get his health back. As he flooded his body with fruits and vegetables, he lost a tremendous amount of weight, got off all his medications, and cured a debilitating autoimmune disease that had plagued him for years. &#x201c;You really should borrow it, Jasmin,&#x201d; John told me, a bit too adamantly for my taste. &#x201c;Seriously, you&#x2019;ve got to see it.&#x201d;</p><p>I fake smiled. &#x201c;You know what?&#x201d; I announced. &#x201c;Nature calls&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>The truth is, when John&#x2014;a naturally excited guy&#x2014;shared his enthusiasm with me, I took it personally. Was his exuberance a way of calling me fat? Was he comparing me to the man in the film? When I was a kid, I had been accused of making everything about me, and perhaps there was legitimacy in that still. But this hit pretty close to home.</p><p>There I was, hiding away in the maroon and turquoise bathroom instead of sitting beside my girlfriend enjoying the company of my good buddies and eating incredible food. I suddenly felt a twinge in my right shoulder. &#x201c;Dang purse,&#x201d; I mumbled, shaking off the pain. What the hell was I carrying with me, anyway? I opened it up and instantly spotted the culprit: my new shoes.</p><p>And by new, I mean old. I had picked up those adorable green and white hemp sneakers at my favorite thrift store in the Mission District earlier that day. I&#x2019;d forgotten putting them in my bag. Satisfied that I wasn&#x2019;t suddenly suffering from brittle bones, I fished out a lip gloss.</p><p>And then, unthinkingly&#x2014;before having the foresight to prepare myself&#x2014;I foolishly looked at myself in the mirror.</p><p>It&#x2019;s amazing, really, how easy it is to master the art of looking in the mirror without actually looking at yourself&#x2014;in a way that doesn&#x2019;t make you want to step in front of a bus, that is. I knew all the tricks: how to hang mirrors a few inches too high so my view of myself was always from the way-more-flattering angle above; how to suck in my cheeks just a little bit to give myself fake cheekbones, widening my eyes at the same time to add to the effect; and, finally, how to look at only one part of my body at a time&#x2014;my eyes if I was putting on shadow, the crown of my head if I was brushing my hair.</p><p>Even a simple act like walking down the street with a friend was like a real-life video game. The challenge? To keep the conversation going while avoiding, at all costs, catching a glimpse of my reflection in a window&#x2014;an image that echoed the truth in ways I was not prepared to handle. And so, rather than take the chance of spotting my silhouette, I would maintain unrelenting eye contact with my hapless companion, who was no doubt wondering why I seemed to be trying to peer into his or her soul. Anything to avert my eyes from the truth, to remain in the dark.</p><p>It had been a good number of years, in fact, since I had looked at myself, head-on, in full, with no preparation&#x2014;with no absurd rationalization of what I was about to see, of <i>who</i> I was about to see.</p><p>Except, this time, I acted too quickly and, as I stared at myself in the bathroom mirror, I accidentally saw it all: my three chins, my blazer that didn&#x2019;t close, and my Humpty Dumpty figure. Just like that, there I was, without my mirror-face on to protect me.</p><p>I was alone in the bathroom, with only myself and my cracked veneer, and yet I was self-conscious, somehow feeling as if I were being watched. My stomach ached, and not because of the numerous triangles of perfectly browned pita bread I&#x2019;d just eaten. I needed an escape, fast. Just as it started to dawn on me that the intensity I was feeling was my own DIY wall of denial beginning to crumble, I randomly spotted a plastic earring on the floor that someone must have dropped. That one-earringed person was clearly my angel, because in that moment, that plastic earring saved my life&#x2014;or at least my evening&#x2014;giving me the distraction I needed to pull myself together.</p><p>&#x201c;Stop feeling sorry for yourself,&#x201d; I quietly commanded. Self-pity was simply not an option. Wallowing should be reserved for people who were truly without. I had no right to be upset just because I was <i>fat.</i></p><p>&#x201c;Focus on what you&#x2019;ve got right,&#x201d; I whispered. Like my thick-framed blue and white glasses, which I had bought at Fabulous Fanny&#x2019;s in the East Village, or the two dozen glittery barrettes that decorated my spiky black and pink hair. I had &#x201c;a look&#x201d;&#x2014;that was what people had told me my whole life&#x2014;and as my weight stepped up, so did my many ornaments. I had always assumed that my eyeliner diverted attention from my bulbous belly and that my nose hoop distracted from my self-consciousness.</p><p>And yet, in spite of the temporary respite provided by the lost earring and my standard pep talk, all my warts were still right there, smack in front of me, staring back. At that moment, a familiar, happy thought occurred to me: I was fairly certain that the overwhelming sense of despair that was always lying dormant in me, and that was starting to bubble up right at that instant in the ostentatious bathroom in the Tenderloin, would be effectively cured by spinach pie.</p><p>So I put on lip gloss without watching and headed back to my booth, where the all-knowing Mariann shot me the &#x201c;is everything okay?&#x201d; look, and I smiled another fake smile&#x2014;all the while knowing she wouldn&#x2019;t buy the bullshit and we&#x2019;d have to hash it out later. She was, after all, one of the realest parts of my life&#x2014;the part that grounded me when the whole world seemed out of control.</p><p>&#x201c;There was a wait,&#x201d; I lied, a little too exuberantly.</p><p>And then&#x2014;Jesus Christ!&#x2014;it was as though my dining mates had paused the clock and stared into space while I was in the bathroom, counting the seconds until I returned to the booth just to pick up the conversation exactly where we had left off. My abrupt exit had been dramatic only <i>to me. </i>Next time I&#x2019;d have to try harder.</p><p>&#x201c;So, as I was saying,&#x201d; John said as he wiped a dollop of hummus from the right corner of his lip. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve gotta see this movie, Jazz.&#x201d;</p><p>Cassie agreed. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve gotta. It&#x2019;s a game changer.&#x201d;</p><p>A game changer.</p><p>When I stepped onstage for the first time in first grade and realized that I could be anyone in the world up there, and maybe I&#x2019;d be accepted, because I was good at it, and I could be <i>someone else</i> while I was center stage&#x2014;that was a game changer. When I slept with a woman for the first time, at nineteen, that had been a game changer (especially for my then boyfriend). When I learned, at twenty-four, that the food industry was lying to me, and I went vegan&#x2014;a decision that shaped me, gave me the kind of fulfillment that many people my age only dreamed of having, and added deep and profound purpose to my life&#x2014;a game changer indeed. When, at twenty-seven, I met Mariann, and together we decided to try to change the world&#x2014;<i>game changer</i>.</p><p>I knew a thing or two about changing the game.</p><p>I held my breath, wanting so badly to talk about anything besides a man who was fat and sick and nearly dead. A man to whom my friends were obviously comparing me.</p><p>Sometimes change comes merely as a result of hearing something at exactly the right moment. Sometimes, like a pair of perfect hemp sneakers at a secondhand store, you have no idea what&#x2019;s about to enter your life.</p><p>Given the conversation about the documentary that my friends insisted I &#x201c;really had to see,&#x201d; it seemed a remarkable coincidence that I had just read an article about juice fasting and, much to my surprise, had found myself intrigued.</p><p>The waiter placed my dish in front of me. &#x201c;The spinach pie, miss.&#x201d;</p><p>My belief that spinach pie would distract me from the thoughts that kept bubbling up proved wrong. In spite of the deliciousness that sat right there in front of me, I could no longer refuse to notice the lingering back and shoulder pain that I felt every morning, the rashes I got on my thighs from flesh rubbing against flesh, the deeply buried sadness and anger that hid behind my days. There were only so many glittery barrettes.</p><p>My shoulder twinged again&#x2014;I was used to being achy. Even though I was only thirty, it was difficult for me to go up a flight of stairs without stopping halfway to rest. Sometimes I stopped in the middle, pretending I needed to adjust the cuff of my jeans, or check a pretend text, just to buy some time before finishing the exhausting trek. Why did I feel like shit all the time? I was young, vegan, and even had a master&#x2019;s in health and healing. And yet, I was digging myself an early grave. It was embarrassing.</p><p>Even though I rationalized my weight by saying that my life of abundance&#x2014;decadent food on a consistent basis, several soy lattes a day, wine each night&#x2014;was a way to repay myself for the hard work I did, the truth was that I knew I was hurting myself. The even deeper truth was that I was <i>addicted</i>, and rationalization is the oldest tool of the addict. Even when the results from my physical came in and I was told, point-blank, that my weight and cholesterol were issues that I needed to pay attention to, I <i>still </i>rationalized. They weren&#x2019;t big concerns <i>yet</i>, I said, and I&#x2019;d deal with them if and when they became issues.</p><p>As I stared down at my spinach pie, I couldn&#x2019;t help but wonder when exactly that moment would come and I would begin to take responsibility for my health.</p><p>Cassie, true to form, was now animatedly discussing the newest cashew cheese to hit the market. It&#x2019;s difficult to find more passionate foodies than a group of vegans. My dining mates and I had seen the dark, early days of bad vegan cheese, so we felt we were allowed a little over-the-top excitement on the matter.</p><p>I interrupted. &#x201c;Hey, you guys?&#x201d; I said, suddenly self-conscious, yet trying&#x2014;as always&#x2014;to seem unflappable. &#x201c;I think I&#x2019;ll borrow that movie you mentioned, if that&#x2019;s cool. The one about being fat and sick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah, sure!&#x201d; John beamed. &#x201c;Pick it up from my office tomorrow.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x2014;</p><p>After I picked up the movie and went back to my hotel room and watched it&#x2014;immediately, on my laptop, with Mariann beside me&#x2014;everything came to a head. All of it&#x2014;the lies, the sadness, the rationalization, the heavy heart, the sometimes misdirected anger at the world and at myself&#x2014;it all culminated in one surprisingly simple, subtle shrug.</p><p>&#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>In retrospect, I am not sure precisely what I meant by &#x201c;let&#x2019;s do this.&#x201d; It seems to me I was trying to say, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do a juice fast. Let&#x2019;s lose weight. Let&#x2019;s get healthy.&#x201d;</p><p>But by &#x201c;doing this,&#x201d; I wound up committing to a whole lot more than I&#x2019;d be able to grasp for years to come, and in some ways am still trying to grasp, and maybe always will be. It took losing nearly one hundred pounds for me to start to understand what I was, in fact, &#x201c;doing.&#x201d; And perhaps more importantly, what the world was doing to me.</p><p>The world was, I would later find out, interested in my size to a much greater degree than had ever occurred to me. Because it was only when I lost the weight and my body suddenly seemed to suit the narrow definition of &#x201c;acceptable&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>slim, svelte, slight</i>&#x2014;that I started to experience what it felt like to be propelled upward by the same society that had previously seemed to prefer that I just disappear.</p><p>Prior to that proclamation, &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s do this,&#x201d; I would have told you that I already had a meaningful understanding of the food I ate and the way it affected me and the way it affected the world. I would have theorized that the reason I had always felt as if I was going up the down staircase was because I was offbeat, or because I was an individual thinker, not because I was fat and therefore deemed unworthy by society; not because I was a food addict who was battling shame issues as steadily as I was battling bullies. I ate and lived in a way that was in harmony with my worldview, and I loved that. That had been good enough for me, until suddenly it wasn&#x2019;t. And when it wasn&#x2019;t anymore, that was when something permanently shifted. That was when it became abundantly clear to me that simply eating in a way that avoided hurting others was never going to be enough if my eating habits were still hurting me.</p><p>So when I started shedding the weight and reclaiming my health, it was quite a shock to learn that, in order to truly live genuinely, I had to confront how I had been betrayed by a food industry that relied on my willful ignorance and by a society that relied on my undiscerning willingness to buy into its arbitrary notions of self-worth and beauty.</p><p>I see now that it was that dinner with my friends that was the turning point. It was the warm decadence and safe reassurance of the spinach pie&#x2014;that suddenly didn&#x2019;t seem so safe. It was John&#x2019;s persistent vehemence that I just had to watch that documentary. It was Mariann gently squeezing my knee under the table, reminding me that I wasn&#x2019;t alone, that she was beside me. That this was real. That I was real.</p><p>It was standing in a bathroom stall, unable to turn around because the walls were closing in on me. It was accidentally catching a glimpse of myself in that bathroom mirror, witnessing in real time my own vulnerability, my desperation, my heaviness.

She studied medicine and psychology before turning to writing full-time and becoming the first Black woman in Zimbabwe to publish a novel in English. Nervous Conditions was the recipient of the 1989 Commonwealth Writers&#x2019; Prize for Fiction, the book has become a modern classic. Nervous Conditions was also chosen as one of the &#x2018;Top Ten Books of Africa&#x2019;s 100 Best Books of the 20th Century&#x2019; by a Pan African Initiative in 2002. Dangarembga&#x2019;s sequel to Nervous Conditions entitled The Book of Not was published in 2006 by Ayebia. In addition, she has written a play entitled She No Longer Weeps. Having studied at the German Film and Television Academy, Dangarembga now also works as a scriptwriter, consultant and film director. She is the founder of International Images Film Festival for Women (IIFF). She is currently working on the third novel in the trilogy and lives in Zimbabwe.Many good novels written by men have come out of Africa, but few by Black women. This is the novel we have been waiting for... it will become a classic. (<i>Doris Lessing</i>)<br><br>Tsitsi Dangarembga -- Winner of the 1989 Commonwealth Writers' Prize<br><br>It is the late 1960s and Tambu is a 13- year-old in rural Zimbabwe. &#x201c;Although our squalor was brutal,&#x201d; she says, &#x201c;it was uncompromisingly ours.&#x201d; Her brother Nhamo has been sent to the mission school in town, his education paid for by her uncle, the family elder. Tambu is thirsty for knowledge, and feels the injustice of being kept on the family homestead, but Nhamo tells her she&#x2019;d be &#x201c;better off with less thinking and more respect.&#x201d; Tsitsi Dangarembga&#x2019;s semi-autobiographical debut was first published in 1988, when it won a Commonwealth Writers prize. It has since become a staple on Eng Lit courses, and is now reissued with a scholarly introduction. A coming-of-age story, it ticks all the right boxes for student essayists&#x2015;colonialism, gender, race&#x2015;and provides a mine of information about Shona customs. Its appeal to lay readers lies with the guileless Tambu, who starts off as a rather prim little girl but turns into a perceptive and independent young woman. (<i>The Guardian</i>)<br><br>Dangarembga raises issues about culture, conflict, displacement, family relationships, consciousness and emancipation in a postcolonial society. On another level, it illustrates what children raised between two cultures may have to contend with.

The town doctor, Paul Faber, considers himself an atheist. But he is charming and likeable, and he seems to have his life in order without God. Juliet and Paul fall in love and seem to be destinged for a life of happiness and service to others. But then Paul discovers a secret from her past he cannot accept.</p><p>GEORGE MACDONALD (1824-1905), forerunner of the Inklings--Scottish minister, poet, novelist, and imaginative seer--was one of the most beloved Victorian authors throughout Great Britain and the U.S. in the 19th century. He wrote some 50 volumes of novels, poetry, short stories, fantasy, sermons, and essays. His influential body of work placed him alongside his eras great men of letters and his following was vast. Two decades after his death, his books were pivotal in leading C.S. Lewis to Christianity. He thus became the foundational member of Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center Seven. After his death, most of MacDonald&#39;s books eventually went out of print as his name drifted from memory. However, he continued to be revered by an impressive gallery of well-known figures, including G.K. Chesterton (who referred to him as one of the three or four greatest men of the 19th century ), W.H. Auden (calling MacDonald one of the most remarkable writers of the 19th century), and Oswald Chambers ( ... how I love that man! ). In spite of such a following, however, MacDonald&#39;s reputation gradually declined throughout the 20th century. MacDonald&#39;s most notable champion of the last century was C.S. Lewis, whose journey from atheism to Christianity was sparked by George MacDonald&#39;s prophetic view of God. Lewis persistently acknowledged his debt to MacDonald, whom he called his master. Lewis wrote: &#34;I dare not say that he is never in error; but ... I know hardly any other writer who seems to be closer ... to the Spirit of Christ Himself.... I have never concealed the fact that I regarded him as my master, indeed I fancy I have never written a book in which I did not quote from him.&#34; Both in his autobiography and throughout his writing career, Lewis emphasized that George MacDonald was the most significant impetus in his own spiritual pilgrimage. MacDonald&#39;s writings can thus be seen as the spiritual soil out of which the faith of C.S. Lewis emerged. MacDonald&#39;s novels, fantasies, and fairy tales provide the imaginative foundation for Lewis&#39;s later writings, including the Chronicles of Narnia. In spite of his own popularity, however, the spiritual roots of Lewis&#39; s faith remain largely unknown. Lewis&#39;s words of 65 years ago are still true today. It has not seemed to me that those who have received my books kindly take ... sufficient notice of the affiliation [with George MacDonald]. Notwithstanding Lewis&#39; s frequent emphasis on the Scotsman&#39;s influence in his own life, MacDonald&#39;s name in the late 20th century drifted into obscurity and his books became unavailable. A resurgence of interest in the forgotten Victorian began to mount in the 1970s and 1980s, given initial impetus by Wheaton&#39;s Wade Center and the work of two Wheaton professors, Dr. Clyde Kilby, founder of the Center, and Dr. Rolland Hein, who released several editions of MacDonald&#39;s sermon extracts. MacDonald&#39;s name then exploded into public view in the years following, largely from the efforts of MacDonald redactor and biographer Michael Phillips. Building upon the efforts of Kilby, Hein, and others, and inspired by them, Phillips&#39;s work resulted in a new generation of readers discovering anew the treasures in MacDonald&#39;s stories, and led to a renewed publication of MacDonald&#39;s books on an unprecedented scale not seen since his own lifetime. Now more than ever, thousands the world over are discovering why Madeleine L. Engle called George MacDonald the grandfather of all of us who struggle to come to terms with truth through imagination.</p><h2>Track Planning for Realistic Operation</h2><p>Here&#39;s a book that belongs on your desk or table when you&#39;re planning your next model railroad.

Many books have examined China&#x2019;s economic rise, human rights record, turbulent history, and relations with the U.S.; none until now, however, have tackled the issue central to understanding all of these issues: how the ruling communist government works. <em>The Party</em> delves deeply into China&#x2019;s secretive political machine.</p></p><p><blockquote><p>An eye-opening investigation into China's Communist Party and its integral role in the country's rise as a global superpower and rival of the United States</p></blockquote><p>China's political and economic growth in the past three decades is one of astonishing, epochal dimensions. The country has undergone a remarkable transformation on a scale similar to that of the Industrial Revolution in the West. The most remarkable part of this transformation, however, has been left largely untold&#x2014;the central role of the Chinese Communist Party.</p><p>As an organization alone, the Party is a phenomenon of unique scale and power. Its membership surpasses seventy-three million, and it does more than just rule a country. The Party not only has a grip on every aspect of government, from the largest, richest cities to the smallest far-flung villages in Tibet and Xinjiang, it also has a hold on all official religions, the media, and the military. The Party presides over large, wealthy state-owned businesses, and it exercises control over the selection of senior executives of all government companies, many of which are in the top tier of the Fortune 500 list. </p><p>In <em>The Party</em>, Richard McGregor delves deeply into China's inner sanctum for the first time, showing how the Communist Party controls the government, courts, media, and military, and how it keeps all corruption accusations against its members in-house. The Party's decisions have a global impact, yet the CPC remains a deeply secretive body, hostile to the law, unaccountable to anyone or anything other than its own internal tribunals. It is the world's only geopolitical rival of the United States, and is steadfastly poised to think the worst of the West.</p><p>In this provocative and illuminating account, Richard McGregor offers a captivating portrait of China's Communist Party, its grip on power and control over China, and its future.</p><p>Richard McGregor is a reporter for the <em>Financial Times</em> and the publication&#x2019;s former China bureau chief.

All rights reserved.<br>COME, DO YOU HEAR IT? The wind-murmuring in the eaves, scouring the bare trees. How it howls, almost musical, a harmony of old moans. The house seems to breathe, an invalid. Leave your scary movie marathon; this is better than TV. Leave the lights out. The blue glow follows you down the hall. Go to the window in the unused room, the cold seeping through the glass. The moon is risen, caught in nodding branches. The image holds you, black trunks backlit, one silver ray fallen across the deck, beckoning. It's a romance, this invitation to lunacy (lycanthropy, a dance with the vampire), elemental yet forbidden, tempting, something remembered in the blood. <br><br>Don't you ever wonder? <br><br>Don't you want to know? <br><br>Come then, come with us, out into the night. Come now, America the lovesick, America the timid, the blessed, the educated, come stalk the dark backroads and stand outside the bright houses, calm as murderers in the yard, quiet as deer. Come, you slumberers, you lumps, arise from your legion of sleep and fly over the wild woods. Come, all you dreamers, all you zombies, all you monsters. What are you doing anyway, paying the bills, washing the dishes, waiting for the doorbell? Come on, take your keys, leave the bowl of candy on the porch, put on the suffocating mask of someone else and breathe. Be someone you don't love so much, for once. Listen: like the children, we only have one night. <br><br>It'll be fun, trust me. We're not going to get caught. It's a game anyway, a masquerade. This is the suburbs; nothing happens here. <br><br>So come, friends, strangers, lovers, neighbors. Come out of your den with the big-screen TV, come out of your warm house and into the cool night. Smell the wet leaves crushed to mush on the driveway, a stale mix of dust and coriander in the wind. It's the best time of year up here, the only season you want from us, our pastoral past-witch hunts and woodsmoke, the quaintly named dead in mossy churchyards. Never mind that it's all gone, the white picket fences easy-to-clean vinyl, the friendship quilts stitched in the Dominican, this is still a new <br>dn0 England, garden-green, veined with black rivers and massacres. <br><br>Keep coming, past the last square of sidewalk, past the new developments and their sparse lawns, past the stripmalls with the Friendly's and the Chili's and the Gap, the CVS and the Starbucks and the Blockbuster, the KFC and the Chinese, their signs dying comets in the night, traffic signals blinking. Come back through Stagecoach Lane and Blueberry Way and Old Mill Place, solving the labyrinth of raised ranches where the last kids (too old but not wanting to grow up just yet) spill from minivans like commandos, charging across lawns for the front door, their bags rattling. The candy is serious here, full-sized Hershey bars and double Reese's Cups. No, there's no time to stop, no need. That's in the past, the happy childhood we all should have had, did have, half missed, didn't appreciate. Keep your mask on. Say something now, it would give us all away. We're past that, the grinning pumpkins left behind, the stoops and warm windows, the reaching streetlights. Out here there's nothing but muddy creeks and marshland, stone fences guarding back pasture gone wild. Here you can still get lost if you want to. <br><br>So come ride with us, driving the night in circles, the trees startled in our headlights. What, you don't recognize the road, the blind curves and crumbled cutbanks twisting so we lean into each other, intimate, even cozy, laughing as we crush the one on the end against the locked door? Remember the incense of cigarettes, the little attendant rituals. Make your fingers a scissors and bum one, it's okay, just don't pocket my lighter. The music's too loud to talk and there's no reason, we're happy trapped in ourselves and the night, this illusion of endlessness-high school, the freedom of wheels. Be seventeen again and ready for the world to love you. Feel the speed through the floor, the air lipping the windows. We're cutting corners, bowing the yellow line, floating over bumps. A deer and that would be the end of us, yet the driver only goes faster, the woods dark as space, still wilderness. <br><br>Look around now. Do you remember any of us? Your face has changed; ours are the same, frozen in yearbook photos in the local papers, nudged up against the schoolboard news, the football scores, the library booksale. One week we're history, martyred gods, then forgotten. Our names, you can't even make a guess (it's those kids that died), but you remember what happened. So you know where we're going. <br><br>Have you seen it? Not just driven by, but have you stopped and gotten out and looked at the tattered bows and ribbons, the sagging mylar balloons and greening pictures sealed in freezer bags, the plastic crosses and browning flowers, the notes written in girlish script, illegible now, pledging to remember us forever? Have you searched the trunk for scars, amazed at nature, since there's not a mark on it? <br><br>Of course not. Even if you were from around here you'd be used to it, maybe even annoyed at the cards and flowers, the shameless sentimentality of teenagers. Don't worry, they'll graduate and move away, and then our younger brothers and sisters, off to college and jobs and marriage, leaving our parents, a mother who dedicates herself to a larger cause, a father who turns inward and strange. One wraps herself in bitterness, another discovers religion. Do they change into gaudy polyester snowbirds or let the house fall down around them? Whatever. Everyone forgets--you have to, isn't that true? Isn't that proof that time is merciful, and not the opposite? <br><br>Don't answer. You'll have time to think about it later--an entire night, an eternity. Halloween comes once a year. <br><br>Can you breathe inside that thing? It's not too hot, is it? <br><br>But look, we're almost there, where the curve bears down on the crossroads. There's no other car, no bad luck, just the tree, the slick of wet leaves on the road, the romance of speed. It's the time of year that kills us, a lack of friction combined with a sideways vector, loose and centrifugal. The police will reconstruct it, pacing off the distances with a limp measuring tape (there's my lighter by the red X), taking statements from the people on-scene, photocopying the long report for the courts and insurance companies. Someone you love has read it or not read it, the contents life-changing and unimportant, checks deposited, money spent. <br><br>From the backseat you can't see the tree, or only at the last minute, if you happen to be backseat driving, chickenshit ("Slow down"). There's a second in which we realize we're not going to make the curve--all of us, even the most hopeful. The sound of the road, so constant, disappears, vacuumed into black silence. Light comes back from the trunk, as if the tree has flashed its brights, warning us off at the last second. It is a game of chicken. <br><br>"Oh shit," Danielle says; you feel it because she's on your lap, your arms wrapped around her ribs, her perfumed thinness. <br><br>"Toe, you fuck"--Kyle, right beside you. (Who? Toe, Kyle, Danielle. See, you've already forgotten. What's my name? What's yours?) <br><br>It's a trick (not a treat), but the tree seems to leap out, seems to drive right at us, wide as a semi. Scream if you want to. After the first few times you'll realize it's useless. You'll remember us, and remember to say good-bye. You'll grow as sentimental as our friends and make this night and this drive stand for our lives, the five of us inseparable. So keep your eyes open. Don't cover your face as we leave the road and shoot through the high weeds (sifted by the grille like wheat meeting a thresher). Remember what happens, how it sounds and smells and tastes. Enjoy the ride. <br><br>Didn't I tell you? There's a reason we call on you, why this night comes again and again, bad dream within a dream. You think it's torture but you know it's justice. You know the reason. You're the lucky one, remember? You live.<br><b>Chapter Two </b><br><br>I KNOW WHAT YOU DID <br><br>BROOKS'S WATCH GOES OFF IN THE DARK CAR, military, the way he's set it since basic, another inelastic habit, and tomorrow starts at zero, a clean slate. There is no midnight, just a digital tick at 23:59:59 that crosses off yesterday, says he's got seven more hours before he can go home to no one (just us, sitting in his kitchen, flitting through the woods). The dogs bark, even with the kitchen light on (and you know we love to tease them), but where they're at it's not a problem. All the way to the front door he'll hear them warning him to leave, just get back in the truck and drive, and don't think he hasn't thought about it. If it wasn't for Gram, Brooks thinks he would--leave it all to the realtor--but that might be a lie. He's lived here his entire life, a real townie; he wouldn't know where to go. (He's going nowhere. We've seen him hang up his gun in slow motion, deliberate as a horror flick, and only Toe's twisted enough to make the holster swing, a cheesy temptation. Don't think about us too much, Brooksie.) <br><br>His watch goes off, cheap Korean double-beep, and wherever he is around town--cruising the shadowed docks of the Stop'n'Shop, cherrypicking in Battiston's parking lot for fathers trying to get their videos back on time--he can see the fastest route to the tree, like a diagram, the map on the wall at dispatch lit up, Old Farms branching off Country Club, taking him there too late, always too late. <br><br>So no one has to tell Brooks it's the anniversary. There's one every night-bee-beep-and he's been dreading it since mid-September, watching the leaves drop, the wind dragging them scratching over the roads, massing drifts in the lee of his truck, maple seed whirlybirds lining the wipers. Weekends he skips his wake-up shower and rakes himself into a dizzy sweat. He knows he can't st...</p><h2>The Privilege of Youth: A Teenager&#39;s Story of Longing for Acceptance and Friendship</h2><p>The best-selling author of A Child Called &#34;It&#34; continues the inspirational story of his life as he reveals the story of his struggle through the challenges of adolescence, detailing the taunting he endured from bullies, the joys of making his first real friends, and his desperate quest to escape his difficult home life. 350,000 first printing.</p><p>Dave Pelzer is the #1 <i>New York Times</i> and #1 internationally bestselling author of <i>A Child Called "It," The Lost Boy, A Man Named Dave</i>, and <i>Help Yourself</i>.

He has appeared on <i>Oprah</i> and <i>The Montel Williams Show</i>, among other national media.A Good Man&#x2019;s Departure<br><br>April 21, 1999, 2:35 a.m.&#x2014;It&#x2019;s been a long four days. In the last ninety-six hours I&#x2019;ve crisscrossed the country, traveling to five states, and have only been able to steal seven hours of sleep. I pride myself on a strong work ethic, but now my body is on the verge of collapse. What began as a slight quiver last week has now become an uncontrollable seizure of my right hand. I&#x2019;ve been able to hide it in public by casually placing one hand on top of the other or making a tight fist behind my back until the tremors pass. But now in the nearly freezing weather of Northern Ohio, for the life of me I cannot steady my hand so I can insert the stupid key into the doorknob of my motel room. After three attempts my patience erodes to the point that I begin mumbling a string of off-color language to the howling wind. Huffing, I slide off my computer case, which contains my hefty laptop, and my worn overstuffed satchel from my left shoulder. Steadying myself, my left hand gently clutches my right one just below the wrist and, after another few stabs with the gold-colored key, I&#x2019;m finally able to fling open the door to my humble room.<p>I&#x2019;ve been on the road for twenty-one days, with another twenty-three days to go before I can catch a glimmer of my fianc�e&#x2019;s face, capture the fragrance from her long auburn hair, let alone hold her by my side in the middle of the night. Looking up at the darkened sky I search to find the North Star, knowing that my teenage son, Stephen, is somewhere on the other side of the country in the middle of a deep slumber. He&#x2019;s about to begin baseball season. How I love to watch that boy play. I can visualize the countless times Stephen would be up at bat, and how I would stand behind the batting cage as if I were him, a child, living an endless stream of days filled with wonder. I&#x2019;d dissect the grip on Stephen&#x2019;s blue-colored bat and how he would twirl it in the air like a helicopter, his body positioned to hit, and the way he&#x2019;d shake his little butt. I&#x2019;d always burst with excitement whenever I heard the distinctive crack from the bat as the baseball sailed deep into the lush green field. I never really had the chance to play baseball as a kid. My thoughts begin to escape me, but I instantly slam that door shut. The intensity of my career coupled with my self-imposed mental compartmentalization is protection for me. I do so by remaining rigidly focused when out on the road. I know from past brief lapses that if I let down my guard for even a few moments, I will cry a river of tears from missing those I love. I also place a great deal of responsibility on myself that borders at times on anxiety&#x2014;worrying about oversleeping or missing a flight, driving hundreds of miles in the middle of the night with bewildering, mind-numbing directions, or my biggest fear of not &#x201c;being there&#x201d; and not giving my absolute best to so many folks who invite me into their communities and organizations.</p><p>April is Child Abuse Prevention Awareness month and I dedicate myself to this cause by traveling from one end of the country to the other, working with teens and adults to help them focus on harvesting their inner strength to overcome a horrendous past, praising those who protect and work with those at risk, and providing all-day workshops on the psychology and resilience of this subject. Today my day began at three in the morning, taping a few radio interviews over the phone, before studying for my eight-hour workshop. Then with the program completed, books signed, and encouragement offered to those struggling with difficult situations, I raced to the airport, completely exhausted, changed clothes in the confines of the airport bathroom stall, and hopped on a plane, arriving just in time to speak at a fund-raiser for a local Boys &amp; Girls club, before catching my final flight of the day in order to start all over again and drive somewhere in the middle of Northern Ohio. As always, when my adrenaline fades it&#x2019;s instantly replaced with a crushing force of exhaustion. At least now, whenever I make my midnight trek, I have sense enough to drive with the air conditioner on, the windows rolled down, and the voice of a local radio talk show host ranting at full volume. Being on the road over two hundred days a year, I have an intense fear of falling asleep behind the wheel ... again. The last time I nodded off, God must have been watching over me. At full speed and with me dead to the world my rental car crossed the median. I awoke just in time to gaze up at what looked like a pair of headlights belonging to some gigantic UFO about to make contact with my car. Through sheer luck and stupidity, I mashed down on the accelerator, missing the semi truck just enough that the car shook from its wake, while I emptied my lungs chanting, &#x201c;Oh my God! Oh my God! Oh my God!&#x201d;</p><p>Before closing the door of my room, I look at the car and smile. After heaving my two mammoth-sized travel bags on the bed, I survey my home for the next few hours: a clean, pine-scented setting, a small worn bed, a fresh set of towels, and a phone. I can&#x2019;t ask for anything more, except for a working heater ... which refuses to do anything but pump in air that is somehow colder than outside. I&#x2019;m too tired to care so I simply give up. Anyway, I tell myself that by the time the room warms up, I would have already taken a quick nap, showered, shaved, repacked, and would be on my way to work. After unpacking, I sit on the edge of the bed then notice the telephone&#x2019;s blinking orange light. I figure it&#x2019;s probably my sponsor, who&#x2019;s being courteous, to invite me out to dinner.</p><p>Dinner. Food. Sleep. For me these are luxuries I can rarely afford. I am always in a frantic state whenever I speak in front of an audience, to the point that I cannot keep anything down. I try to hide my fear, but there have been occasions when my clients who set up the programs can see my apprehension that sometimes brims to the surface. Then, when I fly out again, for some reason my stomach is still in knots. The only solution: I rarely eat. At least yesterday I was able to gulp down some o.j. between my two morning radio shows. Only after I am through for the day, which can be late into the evening, do I reward myself by roaming through the empty streets, searching for a bite to eat. On rare occasions I actually indulge myself with a real sit-down dinner. And when I do, I savor every bite of every morsel. For me, hunger is another switch I&#x2019;m able to turn off at will. It&#x2019;s a trick I learned many, many years ago.</p><p>I know in my heart that I have the most honorable motives for my oddities. I have a revolting past that at times still terrifies me to the core. But yet every day I have to crawl back into the darkest recesses of my former life for the sole purpose of qualifying my message. I usually need to &#x201c;go there&#x201d; three, four, five times a day, or more, pouring out my soul, exposing every fiber of my being, in the vain hope of encouraging and praising others. Since the birth of my son, I woke up to some of the atrocities around me and decided to make a difference, as so many other individuals did for me years ago. Those two primary reasons are why I push myself. If it wasn&#x2019;t for the invaluable assistance of others, I was destined to be doomed.</p><p>With the two fluffed pillows I jammed behind my lower back, I snatch a file and scrutinize every piece of information I can digest for today&#x2019;s first program. I pride myself on knowing my presentation backward and forward yet being completely spontaneous, so I can give the program without the aid of a single note. I make a quick mental note that my day will begin with my first radio interview&#x2014;which is less than two hours from now&#x2014;and my last program will probably end somewhere around nine, nine-thirty tonight... which means I&#x2019;ll most likely crawl back to my motel room around eleven-thirty. I&#x2019;m thankful I won&#x2019;t have to drive somewhere else in the middle of the night. At least tomorrow, tonight, my mind corrects, I can get some sleep, grab a Big Mac, and pray that my boxer shorts and my socks that I&#x2019;ll soon wash in the sink will be completely dry before I carefully and painstakingly repack every article in its place; assurance that I&#x2019;ll be able to carry my necessities for the next round of flights.</p><p>After studying my folder and going over the exact sequence of what to speak on, I allow myself the pleasure of flipping on the news on television. Since Stephen and I love the same baseball team, catching an update allows me a chance of being just a little closer to my son. Because I have little trust in the ancient alarm clock or the clerk at the registration desk who looks like she can slip into a coma at any minute, I set my mental clock to wake me up in just under ninety minutes, which is more than enough time for me to recharge my batteries and give the day every ounce of myself. Before dozing off I clasp my hands together and mumble through my prayers. Although I desperately miss my family and push myself to extremes, I do love my life and all it entails.</p><p>Slipping away I feel the tension ease throughout the length of my body. I catch a final glimpse of the television and decide I&#x2019;m too lazy to switch it off. I let go of my right hand as the shaking subsides. My mind plays a mental tape of children running in the sunshine with their hands raised in the air as if playing a game of cops and robbers. My dream tells me it must be a serious game, since no one is laughing. From somewhere a dull ring penetrates my dream. I think it&#x2019;s part of my dream and try to ignore the sound, but the ringing continues to become louder and sharper until I bolt upright in the bed thinking I somehow overslept and committed my own cardinal sin of being late. But the alarm clock reads just after three in the morning. I&#x2019;ve only been asleep for about eight minutes. Though the ringing from the telephone continues, I become entranced by the television set displaying my dream. I can&#x2019;t seem to understand why children are being marched outside in single file with their hands thrust in the air while an army of police officers have seemingly quarantined the entire area. The commentator dispels my ignorance. &#x201c;Oh my God!&#x201d; I whisper. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe it!&#x201d;</p><p>As I shake my head, denying the tragedy in front of my eyes, I stretch to grab the phone. Before I can place the receiver to my ear, the voice of my fianc�e, Marsha, screams, &#x201c;Thank God! I&#x2019;ve been trying to reach you! Have you heard?&#x201d; Marsha, a lady of absolute grace, who directs the entire operation of our frantic, hypersonic-speed office, and who keeps everything under control, is now on the verge of panic. &#x201c;Where have you been?! I&#x2019;ve been trying to reach you.... Have you heard?&#x201d;</p><p>Turning back to the catastrophe in front of me, I nod my head up and down. Still mesmerized by the television, with every ounce of my being depleted, I reply in stoic short sentences. &#x201c;Um, sorry. My cell-phone battery ran down. I just came in a few minutes ago. I didn&#x2019;t want to call you and wake you up.... Yeah, I&#x2019;m seeing it on TV now. My God, I ... I can&#x2019;t believe it.... How could this have happened?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, it&#x2019;s not that! I&#x2019;m not calling about the shooting....&#x201d; Her voice then softens to a whisper. &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t know. You haven&#x2019;t heard?&#x201d; I can hear the pace of Marsha&#x2019;s breathing pick up. &#x201c;Are you sitting down?&#x201d;</p><p>My heart jumps to marathon speed. My vision is suddenly clear and my mind wide awake. The receiver of my phone strikes the side of my head from my trembling hand. I think it, but can&#x2019;t form the words. Shutting my eyes, my worst nightmare has come true. With perfect clarity, I picture Stephen&#x2019;s bright eyes and wide smile.</p><p>One step ahead of my terror Marsha calmly states, &#x201c;It&#x2019;s not Stephen. Stephen&#x2019;s fine. He&#x2019;s okay. And I know you&#x2019;re exhausted, so please, just tell me you&#x2019;re sitting down.&#x201d; My brain now tallies a long list starting with my oldest brother, Ron, whom I haven&#x2019;t seen or spoken to directly in over eight years. I fear that Ron, a police officer of over twenty years, had been shot in the line of duty. My first thought is to throw everything into the rental car and race back to the airport, catching the first flight to...</p><p>&#x201c;Dave,&#x201d; Marsha interrupts, &#x201c;Dan Brazell passed away.&#x201d;</p><p>With my free hand I pound my knee as I slowly rock back and forth on the side of the bed. &#x201c;... should have known. I should have known. It&#x2019;s not like it&#x2019;s my first time with this ... I ... I should have ... have known.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m so sorry,&#x201d; Marsha cries. &#x201c;Dan, he was like a father to you, wasn&#x2019;t he?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; I choke up. &#x201c;Dan&#x2019;s the kind of father any kid would have wanted for a dad.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Was he that sick?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! He was sick, yeah, but, uhh, last time I saw Dan, um ... was the day he went to the doctor to get a clean</p><p>bill of health. At least that&#x2019;s what he told me when I called later that day. I can&#x2019;t believe it. I just saw Dan right before Christmas. He looked, fine, so good....&#x201d; As my voice rambled on, I kept repeating in my mind that it seemed only yesterday that I had just seen him.</p><p>Within minutes Marsha eased me back to normalcy. I almost had a clean getaway but, before saying good-bye, I fibbed that I was getting enough sleep and eating well. Marsha worries about me and constantly lectures me on taking care of myself. After hanging up the phone with Marsha, I dialed one of the only telephone numbers I knew by heart since I was a young teen: the Brazell family. I left a brief message, replaced the phone in its cradle, then lay back on the bed while listening to the howling wind as it seeped through the gaps in the wall of my motel room. Closing my eyes I could see the man who, in an odd sense, had played the role of my father since the days I was a frightened and, at times, manic teenager in foster care. The same man who guided me into adulthood, and who years later held my own son, Stephen, in his mighty arms.</p><p>Due to my frantic lifestyle and my own home being hours away from his, I never had the chance to see Dan as much as I wanted to. Our last encounter almost never happened. After leaving my two-bedroom condominium at three in the morning in order to make the drive down to the San Francisco Bay Area to have my unique sports car serviced by the dealer&#x2014;who claimed they needed the vehicle all day&#x2014;I was surprised when the maintenance was completed hours earlier. When I phoned Dan, he seemed reluctant to see me. Baiting him, I told Dan I had something to show him. The last time I said something like that to him I was eighteen and showed up in the neighborhood in a brand-new Corvette that the car dealership I had worked for loaned me for becoming salesman of the month.</p><p>The first thing I noticed about Dan when I saw him was how tired and thinner he looked since our last visit. But his smile for me never waned. In his home, where we had spent so many hours together when I was a teenager, I excitedly ran down the &#x201c;what I&#x2019;ve been up to&#x201d; checklist that ranged from my son&#x2019;s progress in school, my upcoming marriage to Marsha, and my career as an author and presenter that, after being mismanaged and surviving off of Cup-a-Soups and French bread for years, had recently taken off. I was shocked when Mr. Brazell casually informed me that he had had a bout with cancer. I felt like a complete idiot rambling on about Dave this, Dave that. Dave, Dave, Dave. For years, b...</p></p><h2>If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho (English and Greek Edition)</h2><p>A bilingual edition of the work of the Greek poet Sappho, in a new translation by Anne Carson.<br><br>Sappho lived on the island of Lesbos from about 630 b.c. She was a musical genius who devoted her life to composing and performing songs. Of the nine books of lyrics Sappho is said to have composed, none of the music is extant and only one poem has survived complete. All the rest are fragments. In<i> If Not, Winter</i> Carson presents all of Sappho&#x2019;s fragments in Greek and in English. Brackets and space give the reader a sense of what is absent as well as what is present on the papyrus. Carson&#x2019;s translation illuminates Sappho&#x2019;s reflections on love, desire, marriage, exile, cushions, bees, old age, shame, time, chickpeas and many other aspects of the human situation.</p><p>&#x201c;The cr�me de la cr�me...a gorgeous object...[<i>If Not, Winter</i>] is a perfect match of text and translator, for Carson is not only one of the most original poets of our time, but a brilliant scholar of ancient Greek...The most ardent gift of the season.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Sheila Farr, <i>The Seattle Times<b><br></b></i><br>&#x201c;Astonishing...Think of Carson&#x2019;s brackets in <i>If Not, Winter</i> as a free space of <i>lyrical</i> adventure and the translation becomes immediately less a document of broken texts than an experiment in trust and imagination, as if each bracket were a flag that Carson was raising to signal us to run up and take over the baton. In her decision to give us less in her translation of Sappho, Carson has actually made the text ultimately more generous, and in this way has granted readers the pleasure of imagining their own versions of Sappho...This is the Anne Carson we fell in love with years ago: the scholar so enamored of her subject that merely gesturing toward it with a grin was enough to hook the rest of us...<i>If Not, Winter</i> is a selfless, faithful, and boldly delicate achievement.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;John D&#x2019;Agata, <i>Boston Review<br></i><br>&#x201c;Because language changes, as do our individual interpretations and understanding of literary works, no translation is final. Classicist, poet and essayist Anne Carson has undertaken a rendering of one of the most popular and written-about ancient poets, Sappho. In <i>If Not, Winter: Fragments of Sappho,</i> Carson adds a fresh and learned interpretive reading of a great poet&#x2019;s lyrical work, which has come down to us in shards...Entering the world of [Sappho&#x2019;s] poetry, by combining these remaining poetic fragments, her sentences and short expressions are nothing less than incendiary. We feel the poet&#x2019;s loves, her desires and her jealousies. Across time, religion and other cultural and social realities, Sappho&#x2019;s work intimately speaks to her reader.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Richard Carter, <i>Times Record</i> (TX)<br><br>&#x201c;Some of the most powerful sections of this volume are incomplete...The silence they create arouses a reader&#x2019;s imagination...It is a testament to Sappho&#x2019;s lyric capabilities that these fragments can break our hearts so easily. Carson prepares us for a poetry ravaged by time, yet there are sections here that speak on love in ways so knowingly modern that it seems impossible Sappho will not be traveling the country on a book tour this fall...Thrillingly alive...Thanks to this beautiful translation, these lines can ignite us three millennia later.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;John Freeman, <i>Memphis Commercial Appeal<br></i><br>&#x201c;However little remains of Sappho's work, the thought of her shone down the millennia, illuminating the work of other poets. For centuries hers was the most admired (and at times the only) female voice that could be heard singing of love...She wrote with passion about the transports of love and worship. She described moments of touching intimacy with a child, a lover or a goddess, using ordinary images&#x2013;a violet, a star, the piercing voice of a bird&#x2013;to carry extraordinary emotion. [In <i>If Not, Winter,] </i>Greek texts printed on facing pages allow readers familiar with ancient Aolic Greek pronunciation, lucky things, to catch an echo of the sound. The rest of us will have to rely on Carson for that echo, which isn't a bad substitute. Although Carson wears her classicist's headdress to make this translation, with her we're always in the hands of a poet, one who knows how to make words pause and spring...Scanty as they are, the fragments of Sappho's songs nevertheless give a taste of what the fuss was all about.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Polly Shulman, <i>Newsday</i><br><br>&#x201c;Sappho composed poetry: erotic, sensual, desperate poetry, filled with the anger of desire, wonder at the beauty of the desired one, the sweet languor of gratification. And now her verse has been elevated to new heights in a gorgeous translation by Anne Carson. It is partly what is missing in the poems to which we bring our own desires and interpretations, that enhances its erotic spell....By bringing her particular kind of austerity to the translation, Ms. Carson has deepened Sappho&#x2019;s mystery and yet brought us closer to her... Ms. Carson is one of the most extraordinary poets writing in English. In book after book, she has bent and reshaped the poetic form.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Dinitia Smith, <i>The New York Times<br></i><br>&#x201c;[Sappho&#x2019;s] words&#x2013;here, in Anne Carson&#x2019;s faithful new translation&#x2013;come as close as literature can to life, to a direct reflection of experience...The fragments of Sappho constitute a compelling demonstration of the tragic power of the word...Carson is in many ways the ideal translator, an accomplished classicist who frequently writes on Hellenic themes in her own verse...Her command of language is honed to a perfect edge and her approach to the text, respectful yet imaginative, results in verse that lets Sappho shine forth without a lot of fuss...Carson&#x2019;s notes are enormously enjoyable. She takes the reader to the very heart of the process of translation...She makes an admission [about a two-word fragment] that few scholars, if any, would be brave enough to utter: &#x2018;On the other hand, I may be reading this sentence all wrong.&#x2019; It&#x2019;s a wonderful sentence, gleaming with a candor worthy of Sappho herself, which inspires confidence that in <i>If Not, Winter,</i> Carson is getting it right, all right.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Jamie James, <i>The Los Angeles Times<br></i> <br>&#x201c;The poet Anne Carson has been thinking about the poet Sappho for a very long time...[and] Sappho&#x2019;s elusiveness has not daunted Carson from producing a dazzling new translation of her work...The book contains every extant word reliably attributed to the woman Plato called the tenth Muse...[Carson] has what might be called a genius for anachronism. [She] is a learned and serious scholar. She is also a bracingly modern polymath. To see her fingering the shattered text left behind by the greatest lyric poet of ancient Greece is to watch an enormous mind pondering a puzzle that was made for it...<i>If Not, Winter</i> is certainly idiosyncratic, though hardly reckless...Yet the new translation feels so fresh and new, it seems almost blasphemous...This Sappho is whispering in our ear in a language we can understand.&#x201d;<br>&#x2013;Sarah Goodyear, <i>Time Out New York<br></i>Anne Carson lives in Canada.</p><h2>Cables Untangled: An Exploration of Cable Knitting</h2><p>Beautiful, intricate, flowing, mysterious, iconic&#x2014;cable knit sweaters are all that and more.

Known primarily as a master craftsman of objects in glass, he was also the designer of exquisite jewelry that attained the highest expression of the Art Nouveau style. This book, published to coincide with a major retrospective of the artist's early work, brings together a dazzling array of jewels, many from private collections shown here for the first time, and presents them in the context of Lalique's contemporary work in glass. Authoritative texts by an International team of scholars examine a broad range of themes and influences on the artist's career from fashion and photography to literature and jeweler's techniques.<br></p><p>Yvonne Brunhammer is curator at the Mus�e des Arts D�coratifs in Paris.

Reader&#39;s Guide available. 50,000 first printing. $65,000 ad/promo.</p><p>Guido Brunetti, the protagonist of Donna Leon's brilliant series about crime in high and low places in Venice, Italy, is back in a smart thriller about a murdered street vendor, one of the illegal immigrants who sell fake fashion accessories outside the tourist mecca's high-priced boutiques while trying to stay one step ahead of the law. Someone had a reason for wanting the nameless African man dead, and the search for the killers and the men who sent them to Brunetti's beloved and beautifully evoked city shortly before Christmas leads the thoughtful, multifaceted and uxorious Commissario to the unfamiliar Venetian milieu where the vu cumpra live. In the cramped, airless room where the Senegalese vendors manage to find shelter, Guido discovers a fortune in so-called "conflict diamonds" hidden among the murdered man's meager belongings. But finding the diamonds' provenance and the killers who were seeking them proves to be an exercise in bureaucratic misdirection. Warned off the case by his boss in the name of "national security," Guido nonetheless persists with his investigation, in the course of which he discovers what--and who--really matters to him. Leon depicts the city she also clearly loves with such skill the reader can almost hear the watter lapping at the edges of the canals and smell the espresso beans roasting in the crisp cold winter air. A tour de force from an author whose reputation for skillful plotting, extraordinary descriptive powers, and complex characters has earned her a loyal base of fans; if you haven't discovered her work before this, <i>Blood from a Stone</i> will only whet your appetite for her extensive backlist of titles featuring Brunetti and his colleagues. <i>--Jane Adams</i>Donna Leon, who was born in New Jersey, has lived in Venice for many years and previously lived in Switzerland, Saudi Arabia, Iran, and China, where she worked as a teacher. Her previous novels featuring Commissario Brunetti have all been highly acclaimed, most recently Friends in High Places, which won the CWA Macallan Silver Dagger for Fiction, Death in a Strange Country, Acqua Alta, A Noble Radiance, Uniform Justice, and Doctored Evidence.</p><h2>Wonders of the Universe (Wonders Series)</h2><p><p><strong>&#x201c;Cox brings a magical enchantment to this life-changing book.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;I swear that you will never be the same again after you turn the last page of this unique and irresistible book.&#x201d; &#x2014;</strong><em><strong>Sunday Express </strong></em><strong>(London)</strong></p><p>Experience the cosmos as never before with Brian Cox&#x2019;s <em>Wonders of the Universe</em>, a gorgeously illustrated, full-color companion to his wildly popular miniseries on the Discovery Channel and BBC.

He describes Old Hickory's early struggle to overcome his reputation as a violent and vengeful man ("virtually a social outcast" in western Tennessee); the spectacular fulfillment of his search for military glory at Horseshoe Bend and New Orleans; and his frequently turbulent two-term administration (1829-1837). In this vivid biography, Remini analyzes his subject's shortcomings, which included wretched administrative appointments, inability to replace the corrupt U.S. Bank with a better system and failure to bring Texas into the Union. But the overall emphasis is on a chief executive who "served the American people extremely well," preserved the integrity of the Union, saved the government from misrule and liquidated the national debt. Jackson stepped down from office more popular than when he entered the White House.

They both live in Brooklyn, New York.My toddler was just learning to talk, and her few words consisted of momma, da-da, paw-paw, maw-maw, outside, dog, and cat. <p>One day, as part of my typical routine, I put her into her crib for her afternoon nap and she did her usual fussing before settling down to go to sleep. There had been a period when she would fall asleep immediately, without any prolonged protests or plaintive cries, but that was in the past. Now naptime was an ordeal&#x2014;both for her and for me. I wondered if I wasn&#x2019;t being too soft. Maybe I was making a mistake by rushing into her bedroom at the very first cry? This time, I resolved firmly, I would let her fuss it out a little before responding so swiftly. Perhaps she could learn to fall asleep without any undue prompting from her mother. I was determined to be strong. </p><p>Alas, the technique didn&#x2019;t seem to be working to well. Instead of quieting down, her fussing grew louder and lower. I assumed she was mad because I wouldn&#x2019;t give in to her, so I valiantly continued to ignore her cries. But when I heard her say "Paw-Paw outside, Paw-Paw outside!" my curiosity was aroused. </p><p>"Paw-Paw" was what she called her grandfather. I looked out the window, expecting to see my father-in-law approach the front door, but no one was there. Yet, over and over again, I kept hearing her say "Paw-Paw outside!" </p><p>My daughter could barely speak, but she was always word-appropriate. Something strange here, I thought, and my resolve crumbling, decided to go in and check on her just to be sure. </p><p>The sight that greeted me made me gasp. Standing in her crib near the window, my daughter had wrapped the mini-blind cord around her neck, and was attempting to climb out of her bed. She had propped herself up by heaping her stuffed animals into a pile, and was straddling the railing when I walked in, not a moment too soon. </p><p>Had she succeeded in climbing over the bed, she would have been strangled by the cord of the blinds. Only seconds separated her from likely death. </p><p>I ran to her side, quickly unwrapped the cord from her neck, removed the blinds from the window, and took the stuffed animals out of the bed. I thanked God for nudging me to check on her. </p><p>While I carried her into the kitchen, she kept craning her head towards the window. All she wanted to do was look outside. "Paw-Paw say no-no!" she told me. "No get out of bed!" </p><p>I couldn&#x2019;t understand why she was so confused today. </p><p>"Paw-Paw isn&#x2019;t here," I told her wearily. </p><p>But on the wall hung a picture of my great-grandfather, and it was toward that portrait that she now pointed. </p><p>"No Momma," she insisted, "that Paw-Paw outside. See?" </p><p>I saw nothing at all. </p><p>"Paw-Paw say I was a good girl," she said proudly. "Paw-Paw say I good." </p><p>She kept pointing outside, but whatever it was that she saw was not visible to me. </p><p>Finally, I heard her say "Bye-Bye Paw-Paw." </p><p>And then she turned to me and exclaimed, "He gone." </p><p>The great-grandfather in the picture had recently died. His death had left me brokenhearted. I missed him so much, especially because he took such a strong interest in my children. </p><p>He had loved my children passionately and constantly worried about their well-being, just as any good old Paw-Paw would. </p><p>&#x2014;Bryath Paige</p></p><h2>Ridin&#39; High Livin&#39; Free Ralph Sonny Barger: Hell-Raising Motorcycle Stories</h2><p><p><em>The open road, a well-tuned machine, and a fine "old lady" hanging on to your back. That's freedom. That's living.</em></p>Ridin' High, Livin' Free<p></p><p>Sonny Barger is the number one spokesman for the outlaw biker life. His <em>New York Times</em> bestseller <em>Hell's Angel</em> was an exhilarating history of his experiences with the world's most notorious motorcycle club. Now the Angel spreads his wings even wider to bring us rousing, moving, wildly entertaining true-life stories of his renegade brothers and sisters in black leather and their relentless pursuits of liberty, individuality, and the "ultimate ride."</p><p>And what stories he has to tell -- freewheeling, bare-knuckle tales of brawls and battles, brotherhood, breathtaking adventures, and crazy quests, and the inevitable classic scrapes with "John Law." The most colorful legends and unforgettable characters of biker lore come alive here: badass dudes like Cincinnati, one of the many Folsom State Prison graduates riding the nation's highways; lone-wolf dreamer Moto Guzzi Ron and his remarkable run at the North Pole, dodging killer bears along the way; and the 1960s saga of party girl Loaded Linda who finally abandoned the biker life for a Silicon Valley gig. Celebrities like Steve McQueen, Johnny Paycheck, and David Crosby thunder through these pages -- alongside some incredibly stylish hog-straddling ladies and quixotic personalities -- in a sensational collection of rebel tales that run the gamut from the poignant and inspiring to the thrilling and utterly outrageous. And through it all, Sonny celebrates the revered creed of the free-spirit motorized wanderer, an ingrained pride and loyalty to the biker fraternity and the glorious machines they love more than their mothers.</p><p>Whether you ride, have never ridden, or just dream of riding, <em>Ridin' High, Livin' Free</em> is a reading experience you won't soon forget. It's a fascinating glimpse into a unique culture of freedom that recognizes only one commandment: the code of the road.</p></p><p><p>Ralph "Sonny" Barger is the author of <em>Hell's Angel: The Life and Times of Sonny Barger and the Hell's Angels Motorcycle Club</em>. A master mechanic who has owned and operated his own bike shops, he currently lives in Arizona, where he rides every day.</p>A notorious biker and two ghostwriters present tales--some true, some not, some embellished--of the open road and outlaw life. Lurid romance, violence, and rough humor come packaged in a style meant to represent the oral informality of aging Hell's Angel Sonny Barger, an eyewitness to many of the incidents he relates. Character actor Philip Bosco does justice to the style by sounding like a quasi-literate boozing brawler. One suspects that Barger takes more delight in regaling his barroom buddies with this fare than Bosco takes here. This reviewer is grateful for this, as he find the permanent adolescents and sociopaths limned herein repulsive enough without the glee.

Unfortunately, they are the prime descriptors of this rendition of Doctorow's recollection of a 1930s' New York boyhood.

His latest novel is The Rozaje Files, third in his new techno-thriller series for Baen.Prince Roger MacClintock is coming home with, besides the handful of survivors of the Bronze Battalion company he led across Marduk, a substantial number of four-armed Mardukans. First, however, he has to get help, in the form of a ship, from a planet inhabited by two different alien races. Then he has to convince the Sixth Fleet of the Empire of Man that, even though he is disguised down to the genetic level, he is really who he says he is, and that he wasn't responsible for the putsch against his mother, the empress. Winning Sergeant Nimashet Despreaux to become his empress-mate is almost a bagatelle in comparison. Furthermore, a whole new set of problems arrives when he and his hardy band hit Earth and begin operations under the cover of a Mardukan restaurant. Real villains the earl of New Madrid and the prince of Kellerman are only part of his worries, and offsetting organized crime are loyalists like Sergeant Major Catrone. <i>Roland Green</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

Renowned economist and Nobel Prize winner Joseph E. Stiglitz had a ringside seat for most of the major economic events of the last decade, including stints as chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and chief economist at the World Bank. Particularly concerned with the plight of the developing nations, he became increasingly disillusioned as he saw the International Monetary Fund and other major institutions put the interests of Wall Street and the financial community ahead of the poorer nations. Those seeking to understand why globalization has engendered the hostility of protesters in Seattle and Genoa will find the reasons here. While this book includes no simple formula on how to make globalization work, Stiglitz provides a reform agenda that will provoke debate for years to come. Rarely do we get such an insider's analysis of the major institutions of globalization as in this penetrating book. With a new foreword for this paperback edition.

With a new foreword for this paperback edition.</p><p>Due to massive media coverage, many people are familiar with the controversy and organized resistance that globalization has generated around the world, yet explaining what globalization actually means in practice is a complicated task. For those wanting to learn more, this book is an excellent place to start. An experienced economist, Joseph Stiglitz had a brilliant career in academia before serving for four years on President Clinton's Council of Economic Advisors and then three years as chief economist and senior vice president of the World Bank. His book clearly explains the functions and powers of the main institutions that govern globalization--the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the World Trade Organization--along with the ramifications, both good and bad, of their policies. He strongly believes that globalization can be a positive force around the world, particularly for the poor, but only if the IMF, World Bank, and WTO dramatically alter the way they operate, beginning with increased transparency and a greater willingness to examine their own actions closely. Of his time at the World Bank, he writes, "Decisions were made on the basis of what seemed a curious blend of ideology and bad economics, dogma that sometimes seemed to be thinly veiling special interests.... Open, frank discussion was discouraged--there was no room for it." The book is not entirely critical, however: "Those who vilify globalization too often overlook its benefits," Stiglitz writes, explaining how globalization, along with foreign aid, has improved the living standards of millions around the world. With this clear and balanced book, Stiglitz has contributed significantly to the debate on this important topic. <i>--Shawn Carkonen</i>Joseph E. Stiglitz is a Nobel Prize&#x2013;winning economist and the best- selling author of Globalization and Its Discontents Revisited: Anti- Globalization in the Age of Trump, The Price of Inequality, and Freefall.

How do dogs know when their owners are returning home at unexpected times? How can horses find their way back to the stable over completely unfamiliar terrain?<br><br>With a scientist's mind and an animal lover's compassion, world-renowned biologist Rupert Sheldrake presents a groundbreaking exploration of animal behavior that will profoundly change the way we think about animals -- and ourselves. After five years of extensive research involving thousands of people who have pets and work with animals, Dr. Sheldrake proves conclusively what many pet owners already know: there is a strong connection between humans and animals that defies present-day scientific understanding. This remarkable book deserves a place next to the most beloved and valuable books on animals, including <b>When Elephants Weep</b>, <b>Dogs Never Lie About Love</b>, and <b>The Hidden Life of Dogs</b>.</p><p>It's rare for a book's title to say so clearly what the book is about. In the case of Rupert Sheldrake's latest work, the controversial content is right on the front cover. Pet owners will see it and smile in recognition; skeptical scientists will shake their heads and mutter about "maverick scholars." We all know of cases of dogs (and cats) who know when their owners are coming home, who go to wait at the door or window 10 minutes or more before their human arrives. Conditioned by the tight rigor of contemporary scientific thinking, we either look for rational explanations or we file the phenomenon away in our minds as "unexplained" and are careful not to talk about it with our scientist friends. <p> Sheldrake has shown in the past that he is not afraid to be labeled a rebel, thanks to his theory of morphic resonance, which suggests the following: </p><blockquote>Natural systems, or morphic units, at all levels of complexity are animated, organized, and coordinated by morphic fields, which contain an inherent memory. Natural systems inherit this collective memory from all previous things of their kind by a process called morphic resonance, with the result that patterns of development and behavior become increasingly habitual through repetition.</blockquote><p> Sheldrake believes that the "telepathy" between pets and humans, or between flocks of birds or schools of fish that move as a single organism, can be explained this theory. Sheldrake is less persuaded by anecdotes that suggest animal clairvoyance--warning of something in the near future--but refuses to disallow the possibility.</p><p> He accepts that the case histories he details so thoroughly in this book are anecdotal, but that makes them no less real; and as a scientist himself he sets up experimental conditions for studying this previously ignored phenomenon that show beyond any doubt that the phenomenon exists. He castigates traditional scientists for their refusal to countenance anything that doesn't fit in with their existing paradigms (or prejudices) and challenges them to come up with some more "acceptable" explanation--but none is forthcoming. </p><p> This fascinating book is a first attempt at a scientific investigation into a puzzling but quite common occurrence. One hopes that other scientists will follow Sheldrake's brave lead. <i>--David V.

What&#x2019;s going on?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;we delivered our sons to Yale for their freshman year this afternoon, and we&#x2019;re dressed for humping boxes of their gear up to their apartment.&#x201d;<br>Elaine nodded. &#x201c;So the boys are off?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;They&#x2019;re off,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;No wonder you both look so glum,&#x201d; Elaine said.<br>Stone looked at Dino. &#x201c;Do I look glum?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah,&#x201d; Dino said.<br>&#x201c;So do you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re empty nesters now,&#x201d; Elaine chortled. &#x201c;Never thought I&#x2019;d see the day.&#x201d;<br>Stone shook his head. &#x201c;Nine months ago I didn&#x2019;t have a son, at least not one I&#x2019;d ever met. Now I don&#x2019;t have a son again.&#x201d;<br>Elaine reached over and patted his cheek. &#x201c;You haven&#x2019;t lost a son,&#x201d; she said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;ve gained a college boy.&#x201d; She got up and continued her rounds of the regulars&#x2019; tables.<br>&#x201c;I guess that&#x2019;s one way to look at it,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;Do you think he&#x2019;ll ever come home again?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Probably not,&#x201d; Dino replied. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ve seen the last of that kid.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Oh, shut up. You&#x2019;re in the same spot.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Nah,&#x201d; Dino said, &#x201c;you&#x2019;re worse off. At least I&#x2019;m not used to having Ben around the house all the time. He&#x2019;s been at prep school for four years, and then his mother yanked him to her place every chance she got. This afternoon, why didn&#x2019;t you raise the subject of visits home?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I thought about it,&#x201d; Stone said, &#x201c;but I was afraid I wouldn&#x2019;t like the answer. After all, the kid&#x2019;s got the money he was paid for his film, which is more than I had a year ago, so he doesn&#x2019;t need me for anything.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He just doesn&#x2019;t need you for buying stuff,&#x201d; Dino pointed out. &#x201c;He still needs a father.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You really think so?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Ben needs me, I&#x2019;m sure of that. Why wouldn&#x2019;t Peter need you, what with his mother dead and all?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;s got Hattie. They&#x2019;re sleeping together, you know.&#x201d;<br>Dino laughed aloud. &#x201c;No shit? What were you doing your freshman year?&#x201d;<br>Stone shrugged. &#x201c;Fucking my brains out, if I recall correctly.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Actually, you continued to do that, at least until you and Arrington got married.&#x201d;<br>Stone managed a smile. &#x201c;If anything, the activity increased after that.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m getting worried about you, kiddo,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re gonna have to get back in the saddle pretty soon or you&#x2019;re gonna forget how.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Yeah, I think about that a lot. It&#x2019;s just that . . . well, it&#x2019;s like not being hungry at dinnertime. I just don&#x2019;t have an appetite.&#x201d;<br>Dino turned and watched as a very pretty brunette in a short skirt came through the door and took a seat at the bar, crossing her long legs. &#x201c;Doesn&#x2019;t that do anything for you?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sort of,&#x201d; Stone replied. &#x201c;I mean, I remember what it was like, the way you remember how you roller-skated when you were a kid, but it just isn&#x2019;t all that appealing.&#x201d;<br>Dino felt for Stone&#x2019;s pulse and looked at his watch. &#x201c;Your vital signs seem normal.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s something, I guess.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; Dino said, nodding toward the door.<br>Stone turned in time to see a tall redhead in a well-cut pantsuit enter the restaurant. She headed for their table and sat down. &#x201c;Hello, sailors,&#x201d; she said, leering a little.<br>Stone leaned over and kissed her. &#x201c;Hello, Holly. What brings you to town?&#x201d;<br>Dino kissed her, too. &#x201c;Same question here.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Agency business,&#x201d; Holly Barker replied. She was an assistant deputy director for the CIA. &#x201c;I hope you guys remember that you&#x2019;re still under contract to us as consultants.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;How could we forget?&#x201d; Stone asked. &#x201c;Lance keeps reminding us.&#x201d; Lance Cabot was Holly&#x2019;s boss, deputy director for operations, or DDO.<br>&#x201c;Well, fellas, you&#x2019;re about to get the call again.&#x201d;<br>Stone slumped. &#x201c;Now what?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t tell you,&#x201d; Holly replied.<br>&#x201c;Can&#x2019;t tell us what?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what I can&#x2019;t tell you, dummy,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;What kind of deal is this?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the deal: you get the daily rate specified in your contract and five hundred per diem.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;For how long?&#x201d; Dino asked.<br>&#x201c;That depends on how good you are,&#x201d; she said.<br>&#x201c;Who can live on five hundred a day?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Clearly, you&#x2019;ve been living too well,&#x201d; Holly replied. &#x201c;If you stay at a Holiday Inn Express, and eat at McDonald&#x2019;s, you can make money on that. Would you like my office to book you in?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thanks,&#x201d; Stone said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll make my own arrangements.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;He&#x2019;ll make mine, too,&#x201d; Dino said. &#x201c;He&#x2019;s a regular travel agent.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;As you wish,&#x201d; Holly said.<br>&#x201c;Come on, give us a hint.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s the only hint you&#x2019;re going to get,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll have a car left for you at the Manassas, Virginia, airport. There&#x2019;ll be an envelope locked in the glove compartment containing your credentials.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Credentials?&#x201d; Dino asked. &#x201c;You think we don&#x2019;t know who we are?&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Sure,&#x201d; Holly said, &#x201c;but nobody in Washington does. You&#x2019;ll have to prove it, especially at the White House.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Which White House is that?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;The only one,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Find yourselves hotel rooms, then be there at six sharp tomorrow evening, freshly scrubbed and pressed. If you&#x2019;re lucky, you&#x2019;ll get dinner, but don&#x2019;t count on it.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Is it black tie?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not that important,&#x201d; Holly said. &#x201c;Just wear one of your nice suits.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;The blue or the pinstripe?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Your choice, sweetie. By the way, I&#x2019;m very sorry for your loss.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Thank you. I got your very nice letter.

It&#x2019;s been a couple of months. It was amicable.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;Let me get you a drink and a menu,&#x201d; Stone said.<br>&#x201c;Love to, but can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s a chopper waiting for me at the West Side heliport, and I&#x2019;ve got a briefcase full of work to keep me awake on the flight home.&#x201d; She stood up, and both men stood up with her.<br>&#x201c;See you tomorrow evening,&#x201d; she said, then walked briskly out.<br>They sat down again.<br>&#x201c;Why did you ask her about the boyfriend?&#x201d; Stone asked.<br>&#x201c;Because I knew you wouldn&#x2019;t,&#x201d; Dino replied.</p><p><b>2</b></p><p>STONE PACKED A BAG THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THEN, ON second thought, packed a second bag.

But one man has yet to tackle the case--and it is just the sort of puzzle at which Chief Inspector Morse excels.<br><br>So why is he adamant that he will not lead the reinvestigation, despite two anonymous phone calls that hint at new evidence? And why, if he refuses to take on the case officially, does he seem to be carrying out his own private inquiries?<br><br>When Sergeant Lewis learns that Morse was once friendly with Yvonne Harrison, he begins to suspect that the man who has earned his admiration, and exasperation, over so many years knows more about her death than he is letting on. When Morse finally does take over, the investigation leads down highways and byways that are disturbing to all concerned.<br><br>And then there is that final twist!<br><br><b>The Remorseful Day</b> is full of the wonderful, unique touches that characterize Colin Dexter's novels. There is the brilliant, cranky Morse, the stubborn Sergeant Lewis, determined to best his boss at his own game, and, of course, the lovingly described town of Oxford, where grand colleges and old traditions are confronted by the new and the nasty. And throughout, there is today's world, as seen by Chief Inspector Morse.</p><p>Over 13 novels and a popular television series later, Colin Dexter's Inspector Morse has taken his place alongside Sherlock Holmes, Hercule Poirot, Lord Peter Wimsey, Philip Marlowe, and a handful of other famous sleuths. Like most of them, Morse possesses an uncanny intelligence, especially in matters of crime and crosswords, but Dexter has always made sure that his detective remains fully a man--flawed and uncertain despite an outward bravado. In this final, difficult story, Morse's humanity unfolds much as his cases do: with the slow revelation of secrets and surprises that frequently catch the reader off guard.<p> The novel begins with events now a year old. Yvonne Hamilton had been found in her home murdered--handcuffed and naked. The Thames Valley Police had supposed robbery, but their suspects had dissolved and all the leads had dried up. A year later, while Morse is on furlough, two anonymous calls to Chief Superintendent Strange open the possibility of a new line of inquiry. Strange wants his best man on the case. Morse, however, shows a surprising reluctance to embroil himself in what seems to be a classic Morsean puzzle. When he finally does reopen the investigation, his unorthodox approach worries even his longtime sidekick, Sergeant Lewis--who begins to suspect that his boss has a personal connection to the victim. What <i>could</i> Morse be up to? And--as many readers will be asking throughout--what could possibly bring his career to a close? </p><p>Like the work of few other mystery writers, Dexter's Morse series has consistently blended the dignity of high art with the grimness of crime and punishment. While it's a clich� to say that he transcends the genre, he has certainly expanded its range to novels that entertain while they instruct--even when that instruction is grammatical. <i>The Remorseful Day</i> is indeed a remorseful farewell, a delicately handled conclusion to a series that will now remain artfully complete, not lingering beyond its time. <i>--Patrick O'Kelley</i></p>"An excellent writer ...

Originally published in 1900, it was the first truly American fairy tale, as Baum crafted a wonderful out of such familiar items as a cornfield scarecrow, a mechanical woodman, and a humbug wizard who used old-fashioned hokum to express that universal theme, "There's no place like home." <p>Follow the adventures of young Dorothy Gale and her dog, Toto, as their Kansas house is swept away by a cyclone and they find themselves in a strange land called Oz. Here she meets the Munchkins and joins the Scarecrow, Tin Woodman, and the Cowardly Lion on an unforgettable journey to the Emerald City, where lives the all-powered Wizard of Oz.</p></p><p>For many of us, the adventures of Dorothy in Oz will forever be associated not with Judy Garland singing &#34;Somewhere Over the Rainbow&#34; but with W. W. Denslow&#39;s exceedingly odd line drawings for the original editions of Baum&#39;s Oz series. The Viennese artist Lisbeth Zwerger, however, goes a long way toward providing a new and refreshed set of images for the Tin Man, the Cowardly Lion, and the humbug wizard. These illustrations are often cockeyed, with occasional realistic details thrown in, like a crow with a corncob in its beak in the first portrait of the Scarecrow. The characters have a poignance and oddity that escaped the makers of the Oz movie.<p>The Wizard of Oz is a beloved American classic.&nbsp; This edition, with fine illustrations from internationally acclaimed artist Lizbeth Zwerger, has been reformatted as a readaloud edition.</p></p><h2>The Farm: A Novel</h2><p><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER � Life is a lucrative business, as long as you play by the rules.</b><br><br> <b><i>Skimm</i> Reads Pick � <i>People</i> Book of the Week �&nbsp;<b>Longlisted for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize �&nbsp;</b>&#x201c;[Joanne] Ramos&#x2019;s debut novel couldn&#x2019;t be more relevant or timely.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>O: The Oprah Magazine</i></b><br><br> Nestled in New York&#x2019;s Hudson Valley is a luxury retreat boasting every amenity: organic meals, personal fitness trainers, daily massages&#x2014;and all of it for free.

She currently serves on the board of <i>The Moth</i>. She lives in New York City with her husband and three children.It is Jane&#x2019;s first day. Her interview at Golden Oaks was only six weeks ago, but it seems like everything has changed. An unknown baby lies in her stomach, and she is a hundred miles away from Amalia, surrounded by strangers. The smiling woman who greeted her in the Dorm&#x2019;s lobby this morning took not only her suitcase and wallet but her cell phone, so Jane has no sense of the time, and she feels even more cut off from her daughter.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jane rolls up her sleeve and extends her arm, wondering if she is getting another shot, and why, since she is already pregnant.<br>&nbsp;<br>The Coordinator straps a bracelet onto Jane&#x2019;s wrist, rubber or rubbery looking, and pushes a button that makes its thin, rectangular screen light up. &#x201c;This is a WellBand.

Try jumping.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jane begins to jump.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;See?&#x201d; the Coordinator angles the bracelet face toward Jane. The green zeroes that had once filled the screen have been replaced by orange numbers that climb steadily as Jane hops, growing short of breath.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;You can stop,&#x201d; says the Coordinator, but in a friendly way.

In truth, she has never worn clothes so thin and so soft. Just this morning in her winter coat, she was freezing. Ate and Amalia waited with her on the street outside their apartment building for the car to arrive, Amalia buried under so many layers of wool and fleece that Jane could barely see her face. But here, in clothes light as air that fit her perfectly, Jane is warm. Jane says so to Carla.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Cashmere,&#x201d; Carla answers matter-of-factly. &#x201c;Golden Oaks doesn&#x2019;t skimp, that&#x2019;s for sure.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>There is a knock on the open door. &#x201c;Hi Jane,&#x201d; sings Ms Yu, giving Jane a stiff hug.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Hello Ms. Yu,&#x201d; Jane jumps to her feet.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Please.&nbsp; Sit.&nbsp; I just wanted to make sure you&#x2019;re settling in.&#x201d; Ms Yu takes a seat on the bench next to Jane. &#x201c;How&#x2019;s the morning sickness? Is your room okay? Did you meet Reagan?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I feel okay, only a little tired,&#x201d; Jane answers. &#x201c;The room is beautiful. So are the clothes.&#x201d; Jane rubs the cashmere on her thigh with her palm, &#x201c;I have not yet met my roommate.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ms Yu frowns slightly.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;But,&#x201d; Jane says quickly, not meaning to get her roommate into trouble, &#x201c;I have only been here since nine o&#x2019;clock, and I had the check-in with the nurse. I have been busy.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Ms Yu&#x2019;s face relaxes. She places a hand on Jane&#x2019;s hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m guessing Reagan was tied up with an appointment. She&#x2019;ll be around soon, I&#x2019;d think. This is your new home, we want to help you&nbsp;<i>feel&nbsp;</i>at home.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>At the word &#x201c;home&#x201d;, Jane&#x2019;s throat tightens. It is past eleven, and by now Amalia is likely strapped into her bouncy chair, thighs jiggling from the chair&#x2019;s battery-powered vibrations, waiting impatiently for Ate to fix lunch.&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br>As if sensing Jane&#x2019;s thoughts, Ms Yu asks, &#x201c;How&#x2019;s Amalia? Was the goodbye hard?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>Jane is pierced by gratitude that Ms Yu, who is so busy, remembers Amalia&#x2019;s name. She shifts her gaze to the wall so that Ms Yu cannot see her eyes, which are teary. &#x201c;It was fine. Amalia is almost seven months now; she is a big girl. And she has my cousin.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s in good hands, then.&#x201d; Ms Yu&#x2019;s voice is kind.<br>&nbsp;<br>Jane still does not trust herself to face Ms Yu. She can hear Carla&#x2019;s fingers tapping on a keyboard.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;I know you know our policy, Jane, which is that we don&#x2019;t allow visitors, and we don&#x2019;t allow Hosts offsite unless at the request of a Client.&#x201d; Ms Yu leans closer to whisper, &#x201c;But I think we can convince your Client to let Amalia come see you.&#x201d;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Really?&#x201d; Jane blurts, almost exploding with gratitude to Ms Yu.<br>&nbsp;<br>Ms Yu puts a finger to her lips and smiles. She asks Jane if she is ready for lunch and, when Jane confesses she was too nervous this morning to eat, leads her to the dining hall. Jane trails several steps behind, wiggling her toes in her new fur-lined moccasins, a tentative sense of well-being creeping over her. Ms Yu keeps up a constant stream of chatter, pointing out her favorite views of the mountains, giving Jane bits of trivia about the surrounding towns. As they walk, Jane imagines Amalia here&#x2014;hiding beneath the soft blankets draped on the sofas, mesmerized by the fires crackling in the stone fireplaces.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Do you think you&#x2019;ll feel at home here?&#x201d; Ms Yu asks. She pushes the dining room door open with her shoulder.<br>&nbsp;<br>&#x201c;Oh yes,&#x201d; says Jane, and she means it.</p><h2>The Fountain Overflows (New York Review Books Classics)</h2><p><p>The lives of the talented Aubrey children have long been clouded by their father's genius for instability, but his new job in the London suburbs promises, for a time at least, reprieve from scandal and the threat of ruin. Mrs. Aubrey, a former concert pianist, struggles to keep the family afloat, but then she is something of a high-strung eccentric herself, as is all too clear to her daughter Rose, through whose loving but sometimes cruel eyes events are seen. Still, living on the edge holds the promise of the unexpected, and the Aubreys, who encounter furious poltergeists, turn up hidden masterpieces, and come to the aid of a murderess, will find that they have adventure to spare.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In <i>The Fountain Overflows</i>, a 1957 best seller, Rebecca West transmuted her own volatile childhood into enduring art. This is an unvarnished but affectionate picture of an extraordinary family, in which a remarkable stylist and powerful intelligence surveys the elusive boundaries of childhood and adulthood, freedom and dependency, the ordinary and the occult.</p></p><p>Rebecca West (1892-1983) was born Cicily Isabel Fairfield, the youngest of three daughters of Charles Fairfield, a journalist in London, and Isabel Mackenzie, a talented pianist who supported her family by giving music lessons. Fairfield was a brilliant storyteller who entertained his daughters with tales of wild adventures in America and Australia, but he was moody and unreliable, and in 1901 he left his wife and children to go to Sierra Leone, where he hoped to start a pharmaceutical plant. The plan failed, and he returned to London, though not to his family, dying when Cicily was fourteen. Inspired by such stars of the stage as Sarah Bernhardt and Mrs. Patrick Campbell, Cicily hoped to become an actress, and in 1910 she enrolled in the Academy of Dramatic Art. Soon, however, she abandoned her theatrical ambitions and joined the staff of the feminist journal<i>The Freewoman</i>, for which she began to write regularly under the name of Rebecca West (adopted after playing that character in a performance of Ibsen&#x2019;s&nbsp;<i>Rosmersholm</i>). Among Rebecca West&#x2019;s protean accomplishments are critical studies of two writers she deeply admired, Henry James and&nbsp;D.H.&nbsp;Lawrence;<i>Black Lamb and Grey Falcon</i>&nbsp;(1941), a vast work about pre-World War&nbsp;II&nbsp;Yugoslavia that combines history, political analysis, and vivid descriptions of travel;&nbsp;<i>The Meaning of Treason</i>&nbsp;(1947); and several novels, beginning with&nbsp;<i>The Return of the Soldier</i>&nbsp;(1918) and including&nbsp;<i>The Fountain Overflows</i>(1956), which is closely modeled on the events of her own childhood.<br><br>Andrea Barrett is the author of five novels, most recently&nbsp;<i>The Voyage of the Narwhal</i>, and two collections of short fiction,&nbsp;<i>Ship Fever</i>, which received the 1996 National Book Award, and<i>Servants of the Map</i>. A MacArthur Fellow, she was also a Fellow at the Center for Scholars and Writers at the New York Public Library."Rebecca West was one of the giants and will have a lasting place in English literature. No one in this century wrote more dazzling prose, or had more wit, or looked at the intricacies of human character and the ways of the world more intelligently."&nbsp;&#x2014;William Shawn<br><br>"A real Dickensian Christmas pudding of a book-full of incident, full of family delights, full of parties and partings, strange bits of London, the lobby of the House of Commons, a classic murder with portraits of the murderer, the murderee and a couple of innocent bystanders, bill collectors, kitchen fires, good food, and a considerable quota of ghosts. West&#x2019;s is a world that is a delight to enter and to live in, warm and vital, and constantly entertaining."&nbsp;&#x2014;Elizabeth Janeway,&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><h2>The Essential Augustine</h2><p><p><b>TABLE OF CONTENTS:</b></p><p><br> Foreword to the Second Edition.</p><p><br> I.

Why gaming casinos are prospering? Why producers raise chickens instead of cows? Why some towns grow while others fail? Minnesota's natural wonders have had an effect on and been changed by the people who call this complex mosaic of lakes and forests, rivers and fields home. Through engaging, in-depth text and copious illustrations, John Fraser Hart and Susy Svatek Ziegler explore the human and environmental characteristics that define the state in Landscapes of Minnesota.<br><br>Illustrated with hundreds of maps and color photographs that reveal the changing character of Minnesota, this stunning geography traces the development of the state's natural environment, how the land formations, plants, and animals became a part of its fabric, and how they have changed over time. Focusing on small towns, the authors document patterns of growth and decline, offering striking commentary on these once-key bastions of Minnesota-ness. Turning to the Twin Cities, they analyze the expanding urban arc and the surprising growth of a baby boomer retirement belt. Landscapes of Minnesota explores how the lives and livelihoods of Minnesotans have affected what the state has become and what it one day will be.</p><p>Susy Szatek Ziegler is an assistant professor of geography at the University of Minnesota and a Fulbright Scholar.

Widely read in it first printing, Deep Ecology has established itself as one of the most significant books on environmental thought to appear in this decade.<br> "Deep Ecology is subversive, but it's the kind of subversion we can use." --San Francisco Chronicle<br> "This book is an attempt at codifying a scattered body of ecological insight into a philosophy that places human beings on an absolutely equal footing with all other creatures on the planet." --Stephanie Mills, Whole Earth Review<br> "Difficult and (to some) unfamiliar insights on nature and human beings presented with simplicity and clarity, Deep Ecology rattles a cage full of occidental presumptions and yet it all seems almost like common sense." --Gary Snyder<br> Bill Devall has studied the social organization, politics, psychology and philosophy of the environmental movement for fifteen years. He teaches at Humbolt State University in California and is active in many environmental groups including Earth First! and the Sierra Club.<br> George Sessions teaches philosophy at Sierra College California.
